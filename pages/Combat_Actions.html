<h5>1. Basic Actions</h5>
<p>These are actions that anyone can do in combat, and the rules associated with them.</p>
<h6>a. Basic Attack, Unarmed (Speed 8, Stamina 5)</h6>
<p>The simplest form of attack, this is a catch all for punches, kicks, headbutts, and any other attack which uses your body to cause harm to your enemy's. This deals 2d4 damage.</p>
<h6>b. Basic Attack, Weapon (Speed Variable)</h6>
<p>This is any ordinary attack with a weapon, from throwing shuriken to swinging oversized swords. The speed is listed with the individual weapon, as is the base damage.</p>
<h6>c. Block (Speed Variable)</h6>
<p>As an action, you may declare that you are blocking, and state a Speed for the action. Until your next action, you may use the Block defense (see 'Defending' below) against any incoming attacks.</p>
<h6>d. Rest (Speed 5)</h6>
<p>Resting is pausing to cool down and gather your breath. Since it doesn't directly lead to incapacitating your enemy, most ninja prefer to do this out of battle; however, sometimes pacing yourself is the only way to achieve victory. Every Rest action you take reduces your Stamina penalty (see the 'Fatigue' portion of this chapter) by 1, to a minimum of 0.</p>
<p>You cannot reduce the speed of your Rest action; 'resting as fast as you can' is, after all, something of an oxymoron.</p>
<h6>e. Perform Handseals (Speed Variable, Abort)</h6>
<p>Most ninjutsu and genjutsu technique require the use of handseals, specialized hand signs that direct and mold the flow of chakra. Representing this, those jutsu have a Seal Speed listed in their description. That number, minus your DEX/10, gives you the modified seal speed, which is the Speed of your Perform Handseals action. However, other Speed-reducing effects do not apply to Perform Handseals. A Seal Speed of 0 means that while handseals are required, you can perform them so fast that the time required is negligible.</p>
<p>Perform Handseals actions are necessary to perform most Ninjutsu and Genjutsu (see below). You may forego part, or all, of your DEX/10 reduction of Seal Speed if you wish (for example, with 40 DEX you could use Perform Handseals action for a seal speed 10 jutsu at anywhere between Speed 6 and Speed 10, as you pleased).</p>
<p>Handseals require the use of both hands, and if they're interrupted for any reason you have to start over again. Although you don't have to declare what technique you're performing the handseals for when you start, all techniques have their own, unique combination of seals to perform them; this means that if you changed your mind partway through a Perform Handseals action, you'd need to start a new one.</p>
<h6>f. Move (Speed Variable)</h6>
<p>For the most part, ninja can move faster than ordinary people. When you actually devote time to moving in battle, you travel (AGI)*(number of IC spent moving)/50 yards.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may need to close the distance and attack an opponent all at once. When attacking, you may move towards your opponent a distance corresponding to half your attack's Speed, for free. Thus, if you needed to rush an enemy and throw a punch at them, and had 25 AGI, as a Speed 8 action you could move up to (25*(8/2)/50 =) 2 yards and then use a basic unarmed attack.</p>
<p>Movement is unique, in that you cannot use Action Points to reduce its Speed. Your distance traveled is determined by the actual number of IC spent on movement.</p>
<h6>g. Interrupt (Speed N/A)</h6>
<p>Being able to interrupt is a special quality certain abilities and techniques have, which allows them to be performed in response to another action, generally an attack directed at the user; for example, most defensive jutsu have this quality.</p>
<p>You may use an interrupt if the Speed of the interrupt (and in the case of ninjutsu, Speed + modified Seal Speed) is half or less that of the action you're interrupting. This is one instance where you may use a ninjutsu with handseals without having performed the handseals as a prior action. The Speed (not, in the case of ninjutsu, counting Seal Speed) of the interrupt is added to your next action on the IC.</p>
<p>Actions used as Interrupts with base Speeds of 3 or below may still be reduced to half (rounded up) of their base speed (normally, an action with a base Speed of 3 or lower cannot have its Speed reduced further).</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>2. Ninjutsu and Genjutsu</h5>
<h6>a. Performing</h6>
<p>The majority of ninjutsu and genjutsu techniques have an entry for Seal Speed in their description. Those that don't, and those with a Seal Speed of 0, can be used at will, like regular actions.</p>
<p>For the rest, however, they may not be used unless preceded by a Perform Handseals action (see above). The jutsu you're using must be used on your next action, at which point its effects are resolved and you, as normal, will determine your next action based on the jutsu's speed.</p>
<p>If you take damage while forming handseals (between the declaration of your Perform Handseals action and when you actually use the jutsu), you must exceed 10 + (damage dealt / 10) on a Chakra Control skill roll in order to continue. Failure means you automatically Abort your Perform Handseals action.</p>
<h6>b. Genjutsu</h6>
<p>Genjutsu are the mind-affecting, often-illusionary techniques used by ninja. While they can be potent in some situations, they're difficult to use against experienced ninja. Attempting to influence someone with Genjutsu (whether directly, such as a mental attack, or indirectly, casting an illusion over an area and determining if it fools them) is resolved through a set of opposed Genjutsu rolls.</p>
<p>The 'attacker' rolls 1d20+XP/400, and the 'defender' rolls 1d20+XP/200, both adding any bonuses to genjutsu. Some bonuses may apply only to offensive or defensive genjutsu rolls. In these cases, the person using the genjutsu is the 'attacker', and the person trying to avoid being affected is the 'defender'. If the defender rolls lower than their opponent, they suffer the effects of the technique being used.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>3. Attacking</h5>
<p>The simplest and most effective way to resolve a conflict is often violence. In some cases, it's the only way. Thus, it behooves any shinobi to be able to, when necessary, incapacitate or kill an opponent.</p>
<p>The first step of attacking is to declare what your attack will be, its speed, and its accuracy, so that the other player knows what defenses they can use against it.</p>
<h6>a. Accuracy</h6>
<p>Accuracy is a measurement of how precise your attacks are, represented by a target number (TN) your opponent has to match or beat on their defense roll. Your attack's Accuracy is 10+(DEX)/10, plus any bonuses you may get from abilities, uniques, or the technique you're using.</p>
<p>After you've declared your attack, your opponent will declare and (if applicable) roll their defense. If you hit them successfully, you'll then roll damage.</p>
<h6>b. Accuracy Rolls</h6>
<p>Sometimes you'll have to make an "accuracy roll". This is essentially the same as your accuracy, but you replace the base 10 with a 1d20 roll. In other words, it's 1d20+(DEX/10) plus any other Accuracy abilities. When something penalizes both Accuracy and d20 rolls, apply only the penalties to Accuracy; if it penalizes only d20 rolls, however, then those penalties also apply.</p>
<h6>c. Damage</h6>
<p>Every attack has a "base damage", a number of dice of a certain size you roll. For example, a basic unarmed attack does 2d4 of base damage. The actual damage formula is, (Base Damage) + (Damage Bonus) * (Speed) + (any other bonuses)</p>
<p>Your damage bonus is the value determined by your STR (for most attacks) or CHA (for ninjutsu). The damage bonus is multiplied by speed to represent that slower, more solid attacks are able to better benefit from your raw power. Some abilities may add bonus damage, but unless they explicitly say so, this does not affect your stat-based "Damage Bonus."</p>
<p>Damage is done to an opponent's Vitality unless stated otherwise, until that reaches 0. Any overflow, and all future damage, goes straight to their Hit Points.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, any alterations of an action's Speed also affect its damage bonus; faster isn't always better.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>4. Defense</h5>
<p>Inevitably, you will at some point be attacked. Accordingly, ninja are trained to defend themselves in a variety of ways. Normally, you may only use a single defense against any given attack.</p>
<h6>a. Dodge (Speed 2, Interrupt)</h6>
<p>The best defense against any attack is simply not being hit. When you dodge an attack you roll 1d20+(AGI)/10, plus any other bonuses to dodge you may have, such as from abilities or uniques, against the attack's Accuracy. Success means you completely avoid the attack and its effects.</p>
<h6>b. Parry (Speed 3, Interrupt)</h6>
<p>This entails deflecting an opponent's weapon with your own, or stopping their unarmed attacks with your bare hands. Accordingly, weapon attacks may only be parried with weapons, and unarmed attacks may only be parried if you have at least one hand free to do so. Parrying works similarly to dodging, though uses an Accuracy roll to determine its success.</p>
<p>When something (such as Fatigue) penalizes both Accuracy and defensive rolls (or rolls in general), Parry only suffers the penalty to defensive rolls; if something penalizes only Accuracy, then Parry does suffer that penalty. Basically, it doesn't have to deal with 'double jeopardy'.</p>
<h6>c. Block</h6>
<p>Blocking is bracing yourself for an attack as effectively as possible, and being on guard to do so at a moment's notice. Blocking is special in that you cannot choose to block at a moment's notice. However, if your last action was to begin blocking (see 'Block' in actions, above), you may automatically block any attack made against you. This is an option; you could still choose to dodge instead, if you desired, and then block the next attack that came your way.</p>
<p>Blocking reduced the damage of unarmed and ninjutsu attacks by 50%. However, weapon damage is only reduced by 25%; while it's all well and good to keep a punch away from your vitals, a sword cut is nasty business no matter where it lands.</p>
<h6>d. Jutsu</h6>
<p>Some taijutsu and ninjutsu techniques may provide special defensive options. Most of these are Interrupts, but the rules for exactly how they work will be listed within the description of the actual techniques.</p>
<h6>e. Partial Success</h6>
<p>Just because you failed to evade a shuriken or deflect a sword slash doesn't mean they struck a vital area. When you make a defensive roll to avoid an attack, for each point you fail by you take 20% damage. Any status effects that are part of the technique, however, will apply normally.</p>
<p>That can be confusing, so, it's example time! So you roll a 14 on your dodge, against an Accuracy 15 attack. You failed by 1 point, so you take 20% of the attack's normal damage. Had you rolled a 12, you would take 60% damage. And, if you had rolled a 7 (failing by 8 points) you would take the full, 100% damage.</p>
<p>With regards to defensive jutsu: Partial success typically applies to any jutsu which works similar to a dodge or parry. That is, you make a d20 roll, and if successful the attack you are defending against does not hit you. However, if the technique has another effect (such as make a d20 roll, and if you succeed you reduce the attack's damage by a set amount), partial success does not apply. Exceptions to this will be noted otherwise in the individual technique's description.</p>
<h6>f. Damage Reduction</h6>
<p>Some effects, such as uniques and clan abilities, provide damage reduction (DR). This reduces incoming damage directly: if you have 10 DR, and an attack does 100 damage, you would only take 90 damage from it.</p>
<p>Damage reduction is applied before blocking or partial defense.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>5. Willpower</h5>
<p>Ninja are capable of incredible feats, and some are truly exceptional, performing astonishing deeds in the face of adversity. While you can be as determined (or not) as you please, Willpower represents your ability to use that determination to push yourself above and beyond your limits.</p>
<p>You can spend Willpower any time you attack, or make a d20 roll, after you've seen the action's normal results. When you spend a point of Willpower, reroll whichever roll it was used on (or, in the case of an attack, make an Accuracy Roll). If the d20 result is less than 11, add 10 to it; this is your new result for that action.</p>
<p>Willpower may not, however, be used to reroll Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls.</p>
<p>You may also choose to spend Willpower after someone else has done so to alter the result of their action. However, any given roll or attack may only have Willpower applied to it one time.</p>
