<h5>1. Advanced Actions</h5>
<h6>a. Take The Hit (Speed 6, Interrupt)</h6>
<p>Taking the hit is the glorious move the stronger person or sensei uses to protect their weaker ally! You make a dodge roll with a +5 bonus; if successful, you've leapt in the way of an attack aimed at your ally. If you fail, your ally takes 20% of the damage per point you failed by. (For example: If you fail by 2 points, you'd take 60% damage, and your ally 40% damage).</p>
<p>If you were blocking when you used this, you make block as long as you were successful by 1 point or more. You may also use interrupts to defend yourself, up to a maximum Speed of how many points your Take The Hit roll beat the opponent's accuracy; you can't dodge, but you could parry, or use a ninjutsu-based defense that raises a protective wall.</p>
<h6>b. Delay (Speed N/A)</h6>
<p>Delay is not, properly speaking, an action in and of itself, but rather a quality certain actions have. For an example of how this might be written, an attack could have "Speed 12, Delay 4". This means that while it would be declared normally on your turn, its effects would take place 4 initiative counts later. The action may be aborted any time up to the last IC of the delay.</p>
<p>For example, using the above attack on IC 10, you would have until IC 14 to abort; on IC 14 itself, so long as you did not abort the attack's effects would be resolved normally, and you would then act again on IC 22. An action's Speed may not be reduced below its Delay.</p>
<h6>c. Abort (Speed 1, or Speed +1)</h6>
<p>Certain actions will say they can be aborted, or just list "Abort" as one of their qualities along with speed (such as the Perform Handseals action). Aborting may declared on any initiative count before your next action, allowing you to act on the following IC. When you abort an action, you stop performing it; exactly what this entails will usually be discussed in the individual actions.</p>
<p>Alternately, you may choose to Abort as part of an Interrupt--for example, aborting handseals so you can perform a defensive ninjutsu technique. This adds 1 to the Speed of that Interrupt.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>2. Multi-Throwing</h5>
<p>Anyone familiar with fictionalized depictions of ninja has no doubt seen them flinging a handful of shuriken with pinpoint aim. As this game is about fictional ninjas, it stands to reason that they can do this! The term, appropriately enough, is "Multi-Throwing."</p>
<p>It helps to first be familiar with the two weapons you'll be throwing the most: They are the shuriken (weighing in at 1d6 damage) and the kunai (beating it out with 2d6).</p>
<p>While you could certainly throw a single shuriken or kunai (that would be a basic weapon attack, and full stats for doing so are listed in those weapons' equipment entries), a real ninja would throw a bunch at once.</p>
<p>By default, you may only throw one type of weapon at once; you could throw 6 shuriken, but not 4 shuriken and 2 kunai in the same action. After choosing your weapon, you decide how many you want to throw. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the multi-throw action.</p>
<h6>a. Multi-Throw (Speed and Stamina Variable)</h6>
<p>You throw at least 2 weapons, up to a maximum of DEX/10. The Speed is 3 + (number of weapons thrown)/2, and the Stamina cost is 5, +1 for every 2 weapons (6 for 2-3, 7 for 4-5, and so forth). Regardless of how many weapons you throw, the minimum total Speed of a multi-throw action is 5--this applies to both its base Speed, and its final Speed after any changes (such as spending AP).</p>
<p>The rolled damage is the total for all weapons thrown; 6 shuriken would roll 6d6. Your damage bonus is increased by +0.5 for every thrown weapon. So, if you had 60 STR in the above multi-throw, your damage bonus would be (60/15 = 4, 4 + 0.56 = 4+3 =) 7. The attack would be Speed (3 + 6/2) 6 and Stamina 8, and have a damage formula of: 6d6+76</p>
<p>If you are multi-throwing shuriken, their +2 Accuracy is applied only once. You do need to choose between shuriken or kunai when you multi-throw; you can't mix-and-match, tragically.</p>
<p>Because wounds represent severe damage from a single powerful attack, and multi-throws are multiple weaker injuries delivered at once, the severity of all wounds caused by multi-throws is reduced by one category, to a minimum of Minor.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>3. Action Chains</h5>
<p>Chains are a special type of action, where multiple techniques are combined or used at once. Each chain has a single Core action, and one or more Links. Your core action can be virtually any action in the PHB, from dodging an attack to using a high-ranked ninjutsu. What makes an action a Chain is, instead, its Links. Links are techniques which, rather than being used alone (or sometimes as an alternative to that), can be used to supplement or modify another action.</p>
<p>The easiest way to identify a Link is that rather than its own Speed value (like "Speed: 4"), it will say something like "Speed: +4". Many of these also have Stamina or Chakra costs written as a number to be added or subtracted. In the description of these techniques, they'll specify what they do, and when they can be used (for example, Kawarimi is linked to a Dodge action; and the E-rank Water-Gathering Technique can be linked to many suiton ninjutsu).</p>
<p>Using a chain is fairly simple. Simply sum up the Speeds and costs of all actions involved; these are the values for the Chain, which is treated as one single, complete action. For example, using Water-Gathering with Water Sphere is a single action with a Chakra cost of 10 and a Seal Speed of 8. When you apply Kawarimi to a dodge, "Dodge + Kawarimi" is your new action, with a base Speed of 6.</p>
<p>Any effects which modify an action's Speed (or other variables) do so to the Chain itself, not individual links (or the core action). In the case of Chains where the Core action is a damage-dealing attack, this becomes slightly more complicated. The Speed value used for your (Speed)*(appropriate Damage Bonus) will be the lower of the Core action's base Speed, or the Chain's final Speed (after all modifications), whichever is lower. The rank of the Core technique determines the rank of the chain; chains using Shuurai (a D-rank Raiton) would always be treated as D-rank attacks, even if you added an A-rank link to them.</p>
<p>There is no limit to how many links a chain may have. You could, for example, make a Chain out of Leaping Shadow Evasion (Core), Phantom Step (Link), Water Splash (Link) and, after that failed, Kawarimi (Link), all for a single dodge. This action would have a Chakra cost of 10 (5+5, from Kawarimi and Mizuhane), and a fairly high Stamina cost (depending on how much effort you put into your Phantom Step).</p>
