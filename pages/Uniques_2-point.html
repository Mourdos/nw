<h3>2 Point Uniques</h3>
<h5>Applied Knowledge</h5>
<p>Where others use talent, you rely on practical application of your (probably vast) knowledge to guide you. It's all well and good for someone to be able to spot the vague outline of a hidden opponent; you, on the other hand, notice the way the bush they're hiding behind has been shifted, as that plant only grows facing west.</p>
<p>You're probably kind of a nerd, to be honest. You add one third of your Research skill rank as a bonus to all your non-Research skill rolls. Ranks in all your skills other than Research are considered to be (Research ranks)/4 higher for the purpose of learning Abilities.</p>
<h5>Avenger</h5>
<p>Someone wronged you, or someone you cared about, in a way which you cannot forgive. You have an unremitting hatred for them, and you channel an unhealthy amount of your free time, thoughts, and energy into finding them and doing whatever you can to make them suffer.</p>
<p>When you take this unique, choose the group it applies to, up to the size of a hidden village. You get +2 to Accuracy and d20 rolls against that group. If the group is only the size of a single clan, the bonuses raises to +3. Against a group of 10 or fewer individuals (who can still be grouped together under a single category, not just ten different people named off individually), it becomes +5. And, against a single person, you have +5 Accuracy and d20 rolls, with an additional +1 for every thousand exp they are above you. You can choose to go into UP-debt to take this unique, though this requires GM approval.</p>
<p>Independent of all the above, you also receive the benefits of the 1-point unique Killing Intent--you've been driven to darkness, and it shows in more than just your desire for vengeance. Upgrades From: Any 1-Point Unique</p>
<h5>Boundless Chakra</h5>
<p>You have near-limitless reserves of chakra. Things that should tire people out simply don't have that effect on you. You have a +3 bonus to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and whenever you acquire a Chakra Exhaustion penalty from using a jutsu, that penalty is reduced by 1. Whenever you rest, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is lowered by the same amount as your Stamina penalty. The Upkeeps of all your jutsu are reduced by 1. Upgrades From: Expansive Chakra Upgrades Into: Regenerative Chakra</p>
<h5>Bruiser</h5>
<p>You hit harder than you have any business doing. You may not be bulky and muscular, but you know how to use your weight and momentum. You add RES/40 to your physical damage bonus (to one decimal point, as usual), and STR/20 to all grapple rolls. You reduce any damage you take by STR/10.</p>
<p>Your Combos are not broken from attacking a new target, or from taking damage from an attack made by someone other than your initial target. You gain a +3 bonus to Counter Combo opposed rolls, and your Combos inflict a (Combo Counter -2) Stun, which is doubled when using a Finisher. Additionally, your combos are not broken by a Stun of a severity less than (Combo Counter +2).</p>
<p>You cannot have this unique as well as Martial Prowess. Upgrades From: Martial Prowess</p>
<h5>Chakra Sensitive</h5>
<p>You have an almost subconscious ability to detect disturbances in the For--chakra. Disturbances in chakra. It's not particularly refined, and it may never be, but it's still a valuable talent among shinobi.</p>
<p>Your sense range is CHA*2. Any time someone within your sense range advances a Fatigue level due to failing a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you know their location and current (after the roll) Fatigue level. If they were hiding from you, this means you now know their location.</p>
<p>In combat, this may be used any time someone makes a Chakra Exhaustion roll, even if they succeed. In this case, roll your Chakra Control against theirs; if you succeed, you know their location. Upgrades Into: Chakra Sensor</p>
<h5>Determined</h5>
<p>You are actually good at something--you just haven't figured out what yet. Some day you'll figure out where your natural talent lies, or everything will just suddenly 'click' for you, and you'll go from underdog to legendary ninja in the making, proving to everyone how great you are.</p>
<p>That's what you keep telling yourself, anyway. It gets a little bit harder to believe that every day, but you didn't get where you are by giving up just because you're no good at whatever it is you keep failing to do. Whenever your Fatigue level increases from failing a CE or Stamina roll, you gain 1 temporary Willpower, which is lost (if you haven't spent it yet) the next time your Fatigue increases. Upgrades From: Hidden Potential Upgrades Into: Any 3-point unique.</p>
<h5>Elementalist</h5>
<p>Most shinobi have a difficult time mastering the usage of elemental chakra. You do not. It comes naturally to you, and even exceeds the limits of most people's physical capabilities. You are able to use two elements of your choice as if you had the Elemental Aptitude ability for them, though this does not actually count as ranks in that ability. Upgrades From: Elementally Gifted Upgrades Into: Elemental Mastery</p>
<h5>Endless Energy</h5>
<p>You don't get tired. It's just not something you do. Whenever your Stamina penalty increases, it increases by 1 less. The first time in a battle you fail a Stamina roll, you advance one less Fatigue category. You enjoy a +(RES)/40 bonus to all your Stamina rolls. Every 15 IC, your Stamina penalty decreases by 1. Upgrades From: Indefatigable</p>
<h5>Exceptionally Fast</h5>
<p>You take speed to a new level. You outrun the wind, your allies, and yes, even the bear chasing you. Everything you do is almost too fast for the eye to follow. The base Speed of all your actions is reduced by 10%; this reduction is actually rounded up, meaning that a Speed 11 technique would be reduced by (11*0.1 = 1.1 -> 2) 2, to Speed 9. Even so, it cannot be used to reduce an action to Speed 0. As long as you partially succeed in a Dodge, you take no secondary effects from the attack (such as status conditions, penalties, or wounds) and when you dodge successfully you may move as many yards as if you'd taken a Speed 5 Move action. When you move towards an enemy as part of an attack, you may move up to that action's full Speed worth, rather than half.</p>
<p>You cannot have this unique as well as Blur. Upgrades From: Blur</p>
<h5>Jutsu Master</h5>
<p>You have a knack for mastering new jutsu, and, more impressively, not confusing them with one another no matter how many you seem to learn. The cost to learn non-clan jutsu is halved, before any other reductions. This is, in fact, retroactive! You reduce Seal Speeds by Dex/8 (instead of Dex/10), do 5% more damage with all your jutsu (not just ninjutsu), and any ninjutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has an additional 5% damage.</p>
<p>You cannot have this unique as well as Seal Master. Upgrades From: Seal Master</p>
<h5>Protector</h5>
<p>Your friends are your life and you will make sure no harm comes to them. Becoming either a wall in between them and your enemies, or an unstoppable force that ravages the oncomers, you will always do your best to get everyone else out safely. You add your RES one more time to your Vitality and HP.</p>
<p>You have a secondary pool of Vitality, equal to half your normal maximum, that cannot be wounded and is damaged only when Taking the Hit for someone else.</p>
<p>Your Take the Hit action has a +5 bonus, and when you successfully take the hit you may automatically block. It automatically succeeds under any of the following conditions: you and your allies are outnumbered; the total XP of you and your allies is less than 75% the total XP of your enemies; you are protecting someone who has run out of Vitality; you are protecting someone of lower rank; or you are protecting somebody with 75% or less of your total XP. Upgrades From: Close Ties, Restrained</p>
<h5>Ranged Specialist</h5>
<p>You prefer to keep your distance in combat, without resorting to powerful ninjutsu. Rather, you favor the basics: projectile weaponry! You may throw up to DEX/8 weapons with a multi-throw, reduce Seal Speeds and the Speed of ranged attacks by 4, and may draw weapons without any sort of action. You may sheathe weapons as a Speed 0 action.</p>
<p>As a Speed 4 Interrupt you may perform a ranged parry with a +4 bonus against any thrown weapon attack (including those caused or improved by jutsu). The exact weapons used don't matter, but you must throw as many weapons in this parry as your opponent did in their attack.</p>
<p>You cannot have this unique as well as Nimble Hands. Upgrades From: Nimble Hands</p>
<h5>Single-Handed Seals</h5>
<p>Be it rigorous training or just excess talent, you've mastered one of the most exceptionally rare talents among shinobi: being able to perform handseals with only a single hand. You reduce Seal Speeds by Dex/7 (instead of Dex/10), and any jutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has a 10% bonus to its damage. Your maximum and current Chakra Control ranks are increased by 2, and you reduce the Seal Speed of any ninjutsu by an additional Chakra Control/10 while using both hands.</p>
<p>You cannot have this unique as well as Seal Master. Upgrades From: Seal Master</p>
<h5>Skirmisher</h5>
<p>You prefer a very specific style of fighting: engage your opponent, seize the advantage while they're confused, then fall back and disengage. While they're trying to recover, prepare yourself to repeat that again, and do so until your enemies are too demoralized or badly beaten to fight back. You have a +3 bonus to Stealth rolls, and the speed of your Hide action is reduced by 3. You can move when in Stealth 2 without lowering the level of your stealth and when making attacks while in Stealth 2 your damage bonus is increased by DEX/30, or DEX/20 if you break stealth to do so. Your limit for Stealth skill ranks is increased by 3, and you can hide so long as your opponents have a visibility penalty of -4 or worse.</p>
<p>You cannot have this unique as well as Lightfoot. Upgrades From: Lightfoot</p>
<h5>Tenacious</h5>
<p>You have learned to delve into the minds of your opponents, figured out the way they tick, and keep a constant control over their mind. Keeping enemies mesmerized is a simple feat for you. You have a +3 bonus to Genjutsu rolls, your maximum and current Research ranks are increased by 2, and -3 to the Speed of all your genjutsu. Opponents must successfully use Genjutsu Kai twice to break free from your illusions; they do realize this after the first success. Skill focus's scale is now once every third rank (Ranks 1, 2, and 3 cost 2 SP; ranks 4, 5, and 6 cost 3 SP; and so forth).</p>
