<h3>3 Point Uniques</h3>
<h5>Chakra Sensor</h5>
<p>You possess the coveted ability to sense the chakra in living things. Unlike being merely sensitive to chakra, you can tell people apart by their chakra alone.</p>
<p>Your sense range is CHA*5. Whenever someone within your sense range advances a Fatigue level due to failing a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you know their location and can identify their chakra signature, as well as their current Fatigue level. In combat, this effect takes places whenever they make a Chakra Exhaustion roll.</p>
<p>You can also tell any general traits of their chakra ("oppressive", "weak", etc.), if they're fallen into HP, and what their Elemental Affinity is (only if they have ranks in the ability). If you detect somebody who's in Stealth, you know their location (i.e. they are no longer hidden from you, just as if you'd found them normally). Your maximum Chakra Control ranks are increased by 3 and you have a +3 bonus to your defensive Genjutsu rolls.</p>
<p>You can also use the following action:</p>
<p>Scan (Speed 10) In combat, make an opposed Chakra Control roll against anyone (or everyone) present; people may allow themselves to fail this roll rather than bothering with it. People being scanned have a penalty to their Chakra Control roll equal to the total Upkeep penalty of any jutsu they're maintaining. If you succeed, you detect them as described above. Out of combat, if someone passes a roll against your Scan they will automatically pass all other rolls against it made within the next half hour. Upgrades From: Chakra Sensitive</p>
<h5>Elemental Mastery</h5>
<p>You have peerless control over elemental chakra, far beyond the realm of what's considered normal, and to a level that some would even think is impossible. Choose two elements; you can use them as if you had taken the Elemental Aptitude ability for them. Additionally, your ranks in the Elemental Affinity ability apply to all elements you can use. This doesn't mean your personal chakra nature corresponds to all five elements, only that you're equally skilled with them all.</p>
<p>Each rank of Elemental Affinity also gives you a +0.5 bonus to your ninjutsu damage bonus with elemental ninjutsu. Additionally, all your offensive elemental ninjutsu receive a bonus depending upon what element your last offensive elemental ninjutsu technique was, and what rank it was. This only works if the jutsu you are using is of a different element than the previous one (using two Raiton in a row will provide no bonus; if you then switch to a Katon, that Katon would receive the Lightning bonus listed below).</p>
<p>Earth: Stun of 2 (rank) Fire: Burns of 2 (rank) Lightning: Paralysis of 1 per rank above E (1 for D, 2 for C, etc.), for 5 * (severity + 1) IC. Water: -2 Chakra cost per rank Wind: Blocking's effect is reduced by 5% per rank. Upgrades From: Elementalist</p>
<h5>Regenerative Chakra</h5>
<p>You have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of chakra. You might push yourself to your limit, but within minutes your chakra reserves will have replenished themselves. During combat in particular, it's noticeable that your energy seems to have no limit.</p>
<p>You have a +5 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls. Whenever you spend a point of Willpower, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is reset to 0; you can also choose to spend a point of Willpower specifically for this purpose immediately before making a Chakra Exhaustion roll.</p>
<p>When using one or more techniques with an Upkeep, the total Upkeep is reduced by 1+CHA/30, to a minimum of half its normal value. Additionally, once per battle you may fail a Chakra Exhaustion check and advance one less Fatigue level (though your penalties do not reset).</p>
<p>You have (your max Willpower) chakra points each battle. You may spend these to improve the result of a Chakra Exhaustion roll on a 1:1 basis after seeing the result. As you are worn down progressively, your body tries to compensate by producing even more chakra. As a result, your ninjutsu damage bonus is increased by your Fatigue level. Upgrades From: Boundless Chakra</p>
<h5>Relentless</h5>
<p>You don't stop, you don't quit, and you absolutely don't give up. Those would be great, admirable traits, except for you it only really applies when it comes to brutalizing other human beings.</p>
<p>Every time you hit someone with a taijutsu attack, you get a +1 bonus to your physical damage bonus, up to a maximum of half its normal value. This bonus resets when you miss, change targets, or use a non-taijutsu attack. Hyuuga using Jyuuken instead receive this bonus to their ninjutsu damage bonus. All your unarmed attacks gain Stun 2, or increase their existing Stun by 1.</p>
<p>When you miss within any taijutsu attack your next action comes sooner, as if the Speed of the action you used was half its actual value. For example, if you missed with a Speed 13 action on IC 30, your next action would come on IC 37, rather than IC 43. Every time you miss, your next action gets a cumulative +1 Accuracy as long as it's a taijutsu attack, to a maximum of +3; hitting someone, or taking a different kind of action, resets this bonus. Upgrades From: Bruiser</p>
<h5>Super Novice</h5>
<p>You're still not good at anything in particular. Everything for you is two steps forwards and one step back. Even if you thought you found your niche, it turns out that no, you really didn't. But you're tired of letting that get in your way! Now, you're going to just do what you want, your way! Yeah! That'll show 'em!</p>
<p>You have a 10% XP bonus. When you're Wounded, you get a temporary 1 point of Willpower. This lasts until the next time you're Wounded; if you haven't spent it by then, it's replaced. If you have, you get a new one. Upgrades From: Any 1- or 2-point unique, except Elementally Gifted or Elementalist</p>
<h5>Surging Power</h5>
<p>You have a dauntless ability to keep fighting, no matter what the situation. Even when you should be sprawled in the dirt unable to move a single muscle, somehow you stand back up and keep fighting.</p>
<p>You can spend Willpower to reroll your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls (with all the normal rules, and benefits, for spending Willpower on a roll). Additionally, you can spend a point of Willpower to ignore all effects of a single woudn you're suffering from for the remainder of the battle.</p>
<p>Finally, you reduce the penalties to Accuracy and defensive rolls by your current Willpower. So, at 3 Fatigue with 4 Willpower remaining you would go from -3 Accuracy and -6 defensive rolls to no Accuracy penalty and -2 defensive rolls. Upgrades From: Boundless Chakra, Endless Energy</p>
<h5>Tactician</h5>
<p>Beyond raw strength or the biggest fireballs, you focus on a different aspect of combat: strategy. Through clever decoys, exploiting weaknesses, and striking at blindspots, you can take down superior foes.</p>
<p>The first time you use any action in combat, it gains +2 Accuracy or to its relevant d20 roll (such as a dodge). If you hit with an attack that receives that bonus, you immediately gain (that action's Speed)/2 AP (though this won't take you over your maximum).</p>
<p>You may spend 10 AP to replace an action's Accuracy (or convert its existing accuracy roll) into an accuracy roll using 2d20.takeHighest(1) in place of 1d20.</p>
<p>You can shout advice or instructions, or just pointers about your enemies and the battlefield, to allies, to give them an edge. As a Speed 0 action, you can switch your current place in the initiative order with a willing ally's, allowing them to act immediately and delaying your next action to the previous location of theirs. This costs 2 AP per IC away their action is, and may not be used on a stunned ally. You may spend 1 Willpower to lower the cost to 1 AP per IC for one use.</p>
