<h3>Pursuit</h3>
<h5>Starting a Pursuit</h5>
<p>If you and all the members of the squad you wish to form together with are out of combat, or 100 Yards away from any (visible) enemy in combat, you may start a Pursuit. This either reflects you going somewhere, chasing someone, or running away from someone! You can do this with any number of ninja, but a minimum of 3 is required for a Formation.</p>
<p>There are three important choices you must make when starting a pursuit. If you are being thrown into a pursuit on the fly, read the rules below marked with +++, otherwise, you first pick a Team Captain, a Tactic, and finally a Formation.</p>
<p>Team Captain - You nominate one of the ninja in your squad to make the decisions for your group, it is important during a pursuit to do things quickly without thinking, so the Captain delegates commands to others, controlling the actions of the squad.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen your Team Captain, determine your squad's Squad Speed. This is based on the lowest speed of any member of your squad. Many things will add or remove percantages to this. It will come up a lot, so remember this number!</p>
<h5>How it Works</h5>
<p>The distances squads can be apart are as follows, and are represented in combat by a number of asterisks. They are also often referred to as degrees: Very Close(1), Close(2), Nearby(3), Far(4), Very Far(5)</p>
<p>Both Team Captains roll their initiatives, then both teams start Nearby. Any members of either team use techniques to buff themselves at this moment as long as they are speed 10 or less. If there was any hidden enemies nearby you start 1 degree closer as the Hunted (or further, if you are the Hunter). Unlike normal combat IC, you each alternate turns, each action listed taking a whole turn. Every turn, you gain 10% Squad Speed at the start. After both parties have had a turn, you both compare Squad Speeds and the higher speed moves a degree in their favor (Hunted move 1 away, Hunters move 1 closer). Gaining or losing speed cannot cause you to go over +50% or under -50%, unless otherwise stated. You continue to take turns this way until one party is caught or gets away.</p>
<h6>Tactics</h6>
<p>The way your team has decided on moving together gives you distinct advantages and disadvantages. The different tactics effect how you build speed and what you can do during a pursuit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Force - Anytime your Squad speed would decrease, it decreases by half the percentage. This includes when it changes to another Formation and/or Tactic. You can use the Stop! action from Close, and the Escape! action from Far. Your squad cannot be broken.</li>
<li>Stealth - You only gain 5% Squad Speed per turn instead of the standard 10%, but your speed cannot be reduced except by changing Formation and/or Tactic. When you use a Volley you can choose to hit them from the sides or center, or with a -5 penalty hit them from the back (or front, if you are the Hunter). When you use the Ambush action, you can do it from one degree further away. You also may use a Stealth -10 in place of any defensive roll.</li>
<li>Cunning - When you gain a percentage speed bonus by any means, you can instead apply it as a penalty to the enemy squad. When targetting a trap, you can choose 2 locations and roll a 1d2, or with a -5 penalty you can choose which direction you want it to hit from. As the Hunter, this makes your successful volleys knock the Hunted one closer and you can use a volley from Far with a -10 penalty.</li>
<li>Speed - Your percentage caps are raised to +100% max speed and -100% minimum. You gain +20% passively at the start of each turn instead of the regular +10%, but any penalty to your speed is twice the amount, and anything that moves your squad in a way other than what you'd like moves you that way twice the amount. This includes when it changes to another Formation or Tactic.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Formations</h6>
<p>The actual formation your squad moves in has vulnerabilities and strengths of it's own. If a formation is hit from it's vulnerable side, it is Broken until the squad assumes a new formation. Any bonus you gain from a formation gains an additional +1 for every member you have over 3 in your squad.</p>
<ul>
<li>Line - Running in a line, one man leading single-file all the way to the end. You get a +5 to any Athletics and Resistance roll and you are vulnerable to flanking. (The Side)</li>
<li>Cross - The group is in a short line, with people branching out from the front to cover the sides. You get +5 Stealth. Vulnerable to an attack from above. (The Back)</li>
<li>Circular - The group covers a nice area, seeing all around them equally. You get +5 to any Awareness and Survival checks your squad makes and you are vulnerable to direct assault. (Center)</li>
<li>V-Shaped - One ninja in the front, then fanning out to both sides. You get +5 to any Espionage checks your squad makes and you are vulnerable to rear assault. (The Front)</li>
<li>Broken - This is what your squad counts as if it has less than 3 members, or something causes it to break. You no longer gain a passive +10% speed per turn. If for some reason you cannot decide on a squad leader, you are similiarly Broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were forced into a pursuit, either by fleeing from an enemy, or from an enemy fleeing from you, there is a special way to handle this! First, both teams get -50% Squad Speed for it being so abrupt. After rolling initiatives, starting with the Team Captains, the teams take turns voting on a Strategy and Tactic. First the Team Captain from the Squad that won initiative votes, then the other team's Captain and one other member vote, then two from the original team, then alternating two members until there are none left. At the end, the Hunter's Team Captain chooses a Strategy and Tactic. For every vote they had for the ones they end up choosing, they get +10% Speed. (This means if two members of your team voted for Force and V-Shaped, and you voted for some different ones, but chose Force and V-Shaped, you'd get +40% Squad Speed! 2 Votes for Force + 2 Votes for V-Shaped) The Hunted chooses this as well, afterward, then the Pursuit begins.</p>
<h5>Actions in a Pursuit</h5>
<p>There are two groups in a Pursuit, the Hunted (The ones being chased) and the Hunter (The ones chasing). There are some actions they can both take and some actions only the Hunter or Hunted can take. Any action which calls for a skill roll uses the highest skill roll in your squad, and only their roll. Any attack done by the Hunter can target the back of the Hunted squad, or the center. Any attack done by the Hunted can target the front of the Hunter squad, or the center.</p>
<h6>General Actions</h6>
<ul>
<li>Change Tactic and/or Formation - Doing this causes you to choose a new Tactic and/or Formation, but you lose 30% Squad Speed.</li>
<li>Press On - You gain a +20% bonus to your Squad Speed.</li>
<li>Taijutsu Volley - This is (for the purposes of damage only) a Speed 10 attack with (Athletics Rank)/5d12, with physical damage bonus. Being hit by a volley lowers your Squad Speed by 10%. This can hit anyone up to Nearby, it's damage being dealt to the whole enemy Squad, and it's strike is an Athletics vs. Athletics or Resistance. You can choose to do either Slashing, Piercing, or Blunt wounds with this. When you attack with this, as the Hunter you hit the Hunted from the back, and the Hunted use this to hit the Hunter from the front. You can choose to make your Athletics check at a -5 penalty to roll [1d4] and hit the enemy from a random location. (1=Center, 2=Back, 3=Front, 4=Sides)</li>
<li>Ninjutsu Volley - This is (for the purposes of damage only) a Speed 10 attack with Chakra Control Ranks/5d12, with ninjutsu damage bonus. Being hit by a volley lowers your Squad Speed by 10%. This can hit anyone up to Nearby, it's damage is dealt to the whole enemy squad, and it's strike is an Chakra Control vs. Athletics or Resistance. You can choose any element someone in your squad can use for wounds. When you attack with this, as the Hunter you hit the Hunted from the back, and the Hunted use this to hit the Hunter from the front. You can choose to make your Athletics check at a -5 penalty to roll [1d4] and hit the enemy from a random location. (1=Center, 2=Back, 3=Front, 4=Sides)</li>
<li>Illusionary Assault - You can lower the bonus percentage cap a squad can benefit from for their next turn. (A squad that could move +50% faster can now only get to +25% faster) If you lose speed from this, you do not gain it back when your cap returns to normal. This is a standard Genjutsu roll, using the highest from both squads. This can be done from Nearby.</li>
<li>Ambush - As the Hunter, you need to have successfully sent a member to Cut-Off the enemy. You can then use this if you're at least Close range. As Hunted you need to use it while they are Close or further away. Roll a Stealth vs. Awareness (This is at a -10 if you are the Hunted), if you succeed, you get into Ambush position and you start combat, with each member who was part of the Ambush starting in Level 2 Stealth, with a +10 bonus to their initiative. If you fail, combat still starts, but the Ambushers have a -10 to their Initiative and are not in Stealth. When the Hunted are Ambushing, it's their whole Squad who get these penalties or bonuses, when it's the Hunter, it's only the members sent in the cut-off.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Hunter Actions</h6>
<ul>
<li>Cut-off - You send a member or two of your squad up and around, to try and position yourself for a nice Ambush. At the end of the Hunted's next turn, roll an Espionage vs. Survival. If you succeed, you are in position, and on your next 2 actions can use Ambush.</li>
<li>Stop! - If you are in the Very Close position, the Pursuit is over, the hunted is stopped, your side begins combat with +5 on each player on your side's initiative.</li>
<li>Give Up the Chase - You can choose to move two degrees away, if this would move you further than very far, you give up chasing. Just in case they wanted to turn back around on you at one point. If you do this three times but somehow don't leave pursuit they can choose to start a new pursuit, with you as the Hunted, starting from the distance you left off.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Hunted Actions</h6>
<ul>
<li>Traps - Put down some traps! You lose 10% Squad Speed to set up traps. At the end of the Hunter's next turn, roll 1d4, as well as an Espionage vs. Survival. The 1d4 determines the direction the traps strike from (1= Front, 2= Sides, 3=Back, 4=Center) If the Hunters fail their Survival, their squad is moved one degree away. They also each take (Espionage Ranks)/5d10 damage, with no damage bonus.</li>
<li>Escape! - If you are in the Very Far position, the Pursuit is over, you have gotten away! It will take them a minimum of one hour to pick up a reliable set of tracks.</li>
<li>Sacrifice!!! - One of your members breaks off from your formation and leads the enemy team away. They automatically get one degree further away. The member who broke off now counts as a seperate squad and their tactic is set to stealth. There are three things the Hunter can choose on their next turn: To continue to pursue the main group, to pursue this 'new group' or to let one of their members leave their group to 1v1 the guy.</li>
