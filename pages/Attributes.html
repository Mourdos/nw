<h3>1. Explanation</h3>
<p>This is a bare-bones walkthrough for character creation. It's best if you're at least partly familiar with the PHB before making your character, but you can get by without that.</p>
<p>The first step of making a character should be settling on a concept: if you're familiar with the series, you may already know which village or clan you want to be from. If you already have a concept (who your character is, where they're from, what their personality's like, what they're good at) then most of creation should be easy for you.</p>
<p>If you don't, feel free to just make it up as you go along. You might find inspiration along the way, especially if it's your first time making a character. Don't be afraid to ask for help!</p>
<p>Please note that when rolling your attributes, you need to find a Roll Watcher (RW), Storyteller (ST), or Gamemaster (GM) can be recorded in the game's roster. You will also need to inform the RW of your chosen clan and Creation Uniques (see below).</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h3>2. Village and Clan</h3>
<p>First, choose which of the three playable Hidden Villages your character is from. This is where your character was trained, who they're loyal to, and ultimately who they work for. The culture between villages does vary, and you may want to read the Village Information nodes, but for the most part it's okay if you don't fit the mold of your home village--ninja are expected to be a little... odd.</p>
<p>Every village is home to several ninja clans. Clans have special techniques dependent on their bloodline or closely-guarded secrets, which you won't be able to learn otherwise. If you want, you may choose a single clan from your village to be from.</p>
<p>Choosing a clan is not mandatory, and clanless characters receive a 10% XP bonus--something that's discussed in detail in the Advancement chapter--and slightly more skill points.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h3>3. Choose Uniques</h3>
<p>As a starting character, you have 4 Unique Points (UP) to spend, unless your clan specifies you have less. You may spend these all at creation, or save some (or even all) of them for later use if you prefer. You'll get more UP later, but they're few and far between, and the Creation uniques may only be purchased with your starting UP.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h3>4. Pick Attributes</h3>
<p>The next step is to determine your five core attributes: Strength (STR), Resilience (RES), Chakra (CHA), Dexterity (DEX), and Agility (AGI).</p>
<p>You start with 20 in all stats.</p>
<p>After that, you have 25 points to distribute among the attributes, with no more than ten in a single stat.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h3>5. Starting Skills</h3>
<p>Unless modified by one of your uniques, you have (total XP)/25 Skill Points (which should come out to 4), which you can spend on any of the game's 10 skills. Now would be a good time to spend them, though don't stress about it too much.</p>
<p>If you're clanless, you have XP/20 Skill Points instead. That's 5, if you were wondering.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h3>6. Spend Starting XP</h3>
<p>You have three options for a character.</p>
<ul>
<li>a. 100 XP, but you get a bonus talent at 500xp.</li>
<li>b. 1000 XP, but gain the Chuunin rank to begin. </li>
<li>c. 1500 XP, Start as a genin.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a starting character you'll probably want to purchase a rank of the Elemental Aptitude ability (in the Chakra category), and the E-rank Ninjutsu techniques Kawarimi, Henge, and Bunshin. These are by no means mandatory, but they're very useful to have. Some ranks in the Money: Requisition ability are also a good idea, if you want to be able to carry equipment with you.</p>
<p>Beyond that, take whatever you think makes the most sense for your character.</p>
