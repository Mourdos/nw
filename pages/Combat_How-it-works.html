<p>====================</p>
<h5>1. Conditions</h5>
<p>Conditions cover the overall health, well-being, and, well, condition, of your character. This lists the conditions, what they do, and where to find more information about them. For how to remove unwanted conditions, see the 'Recovery' section of this chapter.</p>
<h6>a. Wounded</h6>
<p>Trained ninja can survive things that would kill or maim lesser humans, but sometimes a single blow will be so powerful that even their chakra-empowered, well-conditioned bodies cannot simply shrug off. These are referred to as Wounds, and are explained in detail in the 'Wounds' section of this chapter. The effects, and healing requirements, for each type of wound can be found there.</p>
<h6>b. Fatigued</h6>
<p>This is the result of (over)exerting oneself in battle. Rules for Fatigue, including how it's gained and the effects it has, are found in the 'Fatigue' section.</p>
<h6>c. Incapacitated</h6>
<p>When your HP reaches 0, you are incapacitated. You're not necessarily unconscious, and you can still talk, but you're helpless, completely unable to take any kind of action or effectively defend yourself. An enemy who wants to can knock you unconscious with a single blow, or deliver a coup de grace (A speed 10 attack that cannot be lowered by any means) to render you dead.</p>
<h6>d. Unconscious</h6>
<p>One step up from incapacitated, this can result from being deliberately knocked out, or from severe Fatigue. When unconscious you are subject to all rules for being incapacitated, but cannot even talk or perceive your environment.</p>
<h6>e. Dead</h6>
<p>Dying isn't as easy for ninja as normal people. There are two main ways you can die. The first is simple, overwhelming damage: If you are reduced to -100% HP, you die. The second is a coup de grace, a blow specifically designed to be lethal. You may deliver a Coup de Grace only against an Incapacitated or Unconscious opponent. A Coup de Grace is a Speed 10, Delay 5 melee-ranged action.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>2. Status Effects</h5>
<p>Status effects are things that will come and go throughout the course of battle. They come in many forms, and from many different sources.</p>
<p>Some status effects may occur automatically; most of the time. Others, however, allow you a roll to avoid them. Typically, this will be called a "status roll", or a "(specific status, such as burn) roll". Saying that the victim gets a Resistance roll against the effect is equivalent to saying that it has a status roll.</p>
<p>These rolls are either Chakra Control (for ninjutsu), Athletics (for taijutsu--but this is uncommon, as those effects are usually automatic), or Toxicology (for poisons). If anything else, that will be noted.</p>
<p>As implied above, the defender makes a Resistance skill check; if they equal or exceed the status roll, they avoid its effects. If not, they suffer them in full. Do keep in mind, if a technique or effect doesn't say it allows a roll, that probably means any special effects it has occur automatically.</p>
<p>Many of these status effects will be found on damaging attacks--for example, a sword slash that also causes its victim to start bleeding profusely. If the damage of such an attack is reduced to 0, none of its status effects will take place--with a few exceptions. Specifically, Immobilize and Paralysis will apply even if the attack causing them doesn't deal damage. Poison sometimes has special rules in this regard, but they can be found in the appropriate section of the Equipment chapter.</p>
<h6>a. Bleed</h6>
<p>Profuse bleeding from an injury. Among other things, this can ruin your clothes; bloodstains absolutely refuse to come out of most fabrics.</p>
<p>While bleeding, you lose Vitality (or HP) equal to double the severity of the Bleed status every 5 IC, and have a penalty to your Stamina rolls equal to its severity. Every 20 IC, you reduce the severity of the status by RES/30 (after taking the damage).</p>
<p>Bleeds from the same source do not stack; the higher one overwrites the lower. Bleeds from different sources, however, all do their damage separately, though you still use only the highest Bleed to determine your Stamina penalty from the status.</p>
<h6>b. Burns</h6>
<p>Generally resulting from exposure to fire or intense heat, such as some katon jutsu, being burnt makes it harder to fight effectively. Your Stamina rolls suffer a penalty equal to the strength of the burns on you.</p>
<p>You can suffer from multiple burn effects at the same time, though only the strongest penalty is actually applied. Any effects which reduce Stamina penalties reduce the severity of all your burns by the same amount. Accordingly, when you move to the next Fatigue category you are cleared of all burn effects.</p>
<h6>c. Ignite</h6>
<p>You are on fire. Literally, you are burning. This is probably one of the most excruciatingly painful experiences of your life.</p>
<p>Ignite's effects are somewhat complicated. Like most statuses, it has a severity. You suffer a -severity/2 penalty to your Stealth checks, and every 5 IC you take damage equal to its severity, plus its severity in percent of your current Vitality. Thus, an Ignite 10 would give you -5 to your Stealth and would deal 10 damage, plus 10% of your current Vitality. Each time it does damage, you subtract (RES/20) from its severity.</p>
<p>If you have no Vitality remaining, it instead does damage equal to its severity in percent of your maximum HP. The above Ignite 10 effect would deal 10% of your maximum HP in damage.</p>
<p>If someone ignites you again while you are already on fire (seriously, what kind of people are you fighting?), the more severe effect replaces the less severe one.</p>
<h6>d. Immobility</h6>
<p>Immobilization effects are ones such as being stuck in mud or partially bound with ropes. Every point of immobilization reduces your accuracy and defense rolls by 1, and your AGI for the purposes of movement by 10%. Immobilization 10 is "completely immobilized"; you cannot move at all, being rooted to your location (you could still attack and even attempt to dodge, just at a severe penalty). No matter how high your an immobilization penalty gets, its actual applied penalty can never go beyond -10. Multiple immobilization penalties do not stack; if you're suffering from a -8 and a -4, you ignore the -4 until the -8 goes away.</p>
<h6>e. Paralysis</h6>
<p>Paralysis differs from immobilization in that paralysis is an internal or mental effect which impedes your ability to move, whereas immobilization is generally used for effects which somehow physically restrain you.</p>
<p>When paralyzed, the base Speed of all your actions is increased by the paralysis rating, to a maximum of double their original Speed. At the same time, when determining damage from your attacks treat their Speed as if it was (Paralysis severity) lower.</p>
<p>For example, at Paralysis 3 your basic unarmed attack would be Speed 11; you could reduce it to a minimum of Speed (11/2 = 5.5) 6 with AP, and then it would multiply your damage bonus by (6 - 3) 3. That same Paralysis would change your dodge to a Speed 4 Interrupt (meaning that some extremely quick, previously-avoidable attacks might become undodgeable).</p>
<p>Paralysis effects do not combine. If you are afflicted with two paralysis effects at once, the more potent one overwrites the less severe one. If they both have the same severity, the one with the longer duration overwrites the other.</p>
<h6>f. Poison</h6>
<p>When affected by a poison, you make a Resistance roll against some roll of the opponent's. Success means that you shrug off the effects of the poison. Failure means that you have been poisoned.</p>
<p>Actual poisons may carry any number of effects, but the most prominent is poison damage. For every IC that passes, you take damage equal to the poison's rating, for the full duration of the poison. For example, you're affected by a Poison 5 with a duration of 12. You take 5 damage per IC, each IC, until 12 counts after when you were first affected, for a total of 60 damage.</p>
<p>You may be affected simultaneously by multiple poisons. However, a single source (a specific jutsu or type of venom) may only affect you once; another application of it while under its effects simply renews the duration.</p>
<h6>g. Sleep</h6>
<p>People sleep, generally because it's a necessary bodily function, but sometimes because they've been influenced by mind-affecting genjutsu. In reality, sleeping people are pretty much helpless. However, ninja develop a sixth sense that warns them of impending danger and functions even when not awake.</p>
<p>If someone tries to attack or sneak up on you while asleep you automatically wake up and can still roll initiative and/or defend yourself, though do so at a -5 penalty until your first action after waking up.</p>
<h6>h. Stun</h6>
<p>Actions which stun you delay your actions by the magnitude of the stun. For example, if your next action is on IC 14, and you are affected by a Stun 5 effect, your next action would be on IC 19.</p>
<p>Multiple stuns do not stack, but a newer one of higher magnitude will overwrite the older. Thus, using the above example, if you were hit by a Stun 7, your next action would be on IC (14+7) 21; if you were then hit by a Stun 3, there would be no change.</p>
<h6>i. Suffocation</h6>
<p>Someone or something is hindering your ability to breathe. Suffocation penalties stack, from different sources or multiple ones. Your suffocation penalty is applied to any Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls you make, and every time its value increases you have to make a Stamina 15 roll.</p>
<p>Unlike normal Fatigue-related penalties, suffocation is not reset to 0 when your Fatigue advances. When you stop being suffocated, your suffocation penalty is reduced by 1 every 5 initiative counts.</p>
<h6>j. Visibility</h6>
<p>These are penalties which reduce a person's ability to see clearly, impairing the use of their most valuable sense in combat. Visibility penalties do not stack; if you have a -6 and a -2, you ignore the -2 until the -6 is gone. The maximum visibility penalty you can suffer from (after any increases and reductions) is -10.</p>
<p>Total blindness is a -10 visibility penalty; one eye closed (or removed!) is -3. A visibility penalty reduces your Accuracy and Awareness by its value, and your defensive rolls by half (rounded down) of its value; even without their sight, a ninja's sixth sense often alerts them to danger and allows them to respond.</p>
<p>Many visibility penalties affect areas: clouds of smoke or mist and the like. In this case, you suffer the penalty when inside it, or when trying to attack or watch (but not defend against) someone inside it.</p>
<p>If it ever becomes relevant, closing or opening your eyes is a Speed 0 action--but not an Interrupt.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>3. Other Effects</h5>
<h6>a. Area of Effect</h6>
<p>Certain things apply not to an individual, but to all things within a given area--their "area of effect", or AoE. These include things like explosions and smoke bombs</p>
<p>The simpler type of AoEs are ones which are not directly offensive, such as a smoke bomb or a jutsu that creates a thick cloud of mist. These apply certain effects so long as you're in them, and can only be avoided by moving out.</p>
<p>Others, however, are attacks: they cause damage to everyone within an area. Depending on that area, it may not even be possible to avoid one effectively.</p>
<p>When being subjected to an AoE attack, the first thing to determine is if you can dodge it effectively. To do this, take the attack's Speed, and determine how far you could move (see 'Actions') in that time. If that distance is greater than the effect's radius, then congratulations, you can dodge normally. If not, you have a -2 penalty to Dodge per yard you're short by.</p>
<p>As AoEs are not, strictly speaking, targeting you, they generally cannot be parried. Other defenses, such as raising a ninjutsu-based wall, are typically effective.</p>
<h6>b. Knockback</h6>
<p>Certain jutsu have an effect referred to as "knockback", which does about what it sounds like: pushes you away from its user or point of origin. Knockback is measured in yards; a 10 yard knockback means that, if you are hit, you will be moved 10 yards away from wherever the jutsu originated from.</p>
<p>Some may have more complex rules, such as pushing you to the edge of their area of effect.</p>
<p>When a technique knocks you back a certain number of yards, if partial defense applies then you will also reduce the knockback by that amount.</p>
<p>The exception is area-of-effect knock backs centered on an individual (such as a Hyuuga's Kaiten and the A-rank jutsu Eye of the Storm): partial defense does not reduce the knockback from these, as they essentially "push" everything away from them equally.</p>
<h6>c. Clones and Conditions</h6>
<p>Any clones you summon are subject to the same statuses and conditions you are suffering from at the time you summon them. This includes wounds or any status effect.</p>
<p>Note: It may be a bad idea to make clones while on fire.</p>
