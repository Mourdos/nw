<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>Combat... happens. Realistically, it's something ninja know how to do, and as they get more experience it becomes something they're able to do very well. Accordingly, there are rules for combat, which you use when trying to beat other people into submission, or prevent them from doing the same to you.</p>
<p>The combat chapter has 7 sections of varying importance, which are...!</p>
<h5>Initiative</h5>
<p>A brief explanation of the core of Naruto World's combat system. It explains the broad concepts of how time, turn order, and actions are handled. A short but important read! Pretty much nothing else in the chapter will make sense without this.</p>
<h5>Actions</h5>
<p>Coming in right behind 'Initiative' in terms of importance, here is where you'll find all the basic actions which everyone can perform, along with rules on how to attack and your bread-and-butter defenses. Other attractions include a crash course in how to use ninjutsu and genjutsu, and rules for spending Willpower (you remember Willpower, right? one of your derived Attributes?).</p>
<h5>Stealth</h5>
<p>How to hide, how to find people who are hiding, and what you can do while hidden. You should probably be at least familiar with this before you start playing, but you can safely ignore it your first time through the chapter.</p>
<h5>Status and Conditions</h5>
<p>You may want to skim this section, but it's not vital. You should have read the Conditions part at least once before you get into combat, and you can basically ignore Statuses until they actually come up during battle; same for effects.</p>
<h5>Fatigue</h5>
<p>This is important; Fatigue is one of the key elements of combat, as it's what regulates how frequently you can use your powerful jutsu before being worn out. You should probably read it right after Initiative, or perhaps Actions. Definitely more important than Stealth or Status/Conditions.</p>
<h5>Wounds</h5>
<p>You should read the Explanation node before you get into combat. The rest you can safely ignore until you actually have to deal with the effects, either due to inflicting them on others, or suffering from them yourself.</p>
<h5>Recovery</h5>
<p>While it wouldn't hurt to at least peruse the node (though the 'Guidelines' section can be ignored unless those topics actually come up), you can basically ignore this entirely until the aftermath of your first battle.</p>
