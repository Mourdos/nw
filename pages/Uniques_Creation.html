<h3>Creation Uniques</h3>
<h5>Analyst</h5>
<p>You like to study everything you can about people, their actions, their routines, as well as everything around you. This can be distracting at times, but usually it'll give you a good grasp of the situation and your surroundings.</p>
<p>You have a +3 bonus to Awareness, and whenever you take a Rest action you gain 5 AP. You begin combat with 10 AP and if someone uses the same type of attack (Katon, Weapon Taijutsu, etc.) in succession you get a +2 to your defenses. This does not stack.</p>
<p>You have a -5 penalty to your choice of either Espionage, Stealth, or Survival (your choice). Your observational powers come at a price!</p>
<h5>Berserker</h5>
<p>A beast of a ninja you are, and you act like one too! You get angry easily, and often make rash, terrible decisions out of being bull-headed. At least you're hard to take down when things come to combat (as they often do).</p>
<p>You add an extra STR*2 to your Vitality, can fight until -25% HP, and can opt to not take a defensive action in response to an enemy's attack. If their attack Wounds you, you can choose which location it hits (unless the attack is a called shot). Assuming you're still standing, you can then immediately counteract, using any physical attack at your disposal, even though it's not your action. This attack is made at half its normal Speed, cannot have its Speed reduced further, and has a +3 Accuracy bonus.</p>
<p>This attack must be directed at the person who attacked you. Its base Speed cannot be greater than the base Speed of the attack which provoked it.</p>
<p>When you fall below 20% Vitality in combat, you can choose to immediately surrender or keep fighting. If you keep fighting, you won't stop until you're unconscious, or all your opponents have surrendered or been incapacitated</p>
<h5>Competitive</h5>
<p>You always want to win every race, hit the bull's-eye first, and beat everyone in every game you play. In fights, winning is your everything; that can be good, since losing a fight as a ninja may have fatal consequences.</p>
<p>You gain 3 bonus XP for winning a sparring match or fight, all your attacks do an extra 5% damage, and you gain a +2 to all d20 rolls. Whenever you miss with an attack, you become increasingly frustrated and driven to land a solid blow on your enemy. This gives you a -1 penalty to all your d20 rolls, but also a +1 bonus to Accuracy, up to a maximum of -5 and +5 respectively (attacks with accuracy rolls use the accuracy bonus, not the d20 roll penalty). These both reset to 0 when you hit someone.</p>
<h5>Defender</h5>
<p>Throwing solid blocks, you've honed your reflexes and worked your bones and tendons hard so that your twitch reflex is all you need to keep yourself safe.</p>
<p>You can use the Block defense as a Speed 5 Interrupt. This does have one downside: If you're Stunned when you do this, your Block reduces the incoming attack's damage by 25% less than it normally would. When you don't block, you reduce the damage you take by RES/5 and treat the damage as if it was 20% lower when determining what Wounds you receive. Finally, anyone who makes an unarmed attack against you takes your STR/2 damage, whether or not you block--punching you hurts!</p>
<p>The focus on self-preservation, however, has left you more cautious than most even when attacking. The damage of all your attacks is considered 10% lower for determining what wounds they cause. This doesn't apply to Jutsu which explicitly increase the damage for wounding purposes.</p>
<h5>Energetic</h5>
<p>Running, jumping, swimming, fighting; none of it seems to tire you out. Eventually you'll wear down, but not until long after your friends are left staggering around and panting for breath. On the other hand, it's hard to sit still and focus, let alone study, when you're more or less hyperactive.</p>
<p>You have 6 levels of Fatigue instead of the usual 5, and suffer Fatigue penalties (-1 Accuracy, -2 defenses, and so on) as if you were one Fatigue category lower, while retaining the regular benefits. However, your maximum ranks in all skills are reduced by 3.</p>
<h5>Genius</h5>
<p>The term 'genius' has a different meaning to ninja than ordinary people. It's not a measure of intelligence, but rather how easily one can understand the concepts behind ninja techniques. The smartest shinobi alive might not be called a genius, but a Genin using advanced jutsu certainly would. Ninja are just kind of like that.</p>
<p>Your natural talent may allow you to be lazy and smug, or it could motivate you on to further greatness. The cost to learn jutsu is halved! Round up, if necessary. Additionally you get your first three Talents at 750, 2000, and 3750 XP (instead of 1000, 2500, and 4500), and another 1 Talent Point every 1250 XP thereafter (instead of 1500 XP, normally). Finally, you become able to learn D-rank jutsu at 100 XP, C-rank jutsu at 300 XP, B-ranks at 2000, and A-ranks at 4000, without needing to meet any skill or rank requirements.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you're not without your limitations. This doesn't allow you to ignore other requirements, such as Abilities or Talents. Additionally, it doesn't allow you to ignore requirements specific to individual techniques (such as the Poison Cloud or Telescope Tecniques). Furthermore, reaching beyond your grasp has a cost. Any jutsu you couldn't use without Genius' effects has its damage treated as being 20% lower for the purposes of causing wounds.</p>
<h5>Juggernaut</h5>
<p>You are a solid, hulking brute. You aren't necessarily tall, but you condition yourself hard and have always had a natural gift at receiving pain! Massive, solid forearm muscles and tendons, strong shins, you are a rough opponent to face.</p>
<p>You reduce all damage you take by RES/4, and treat damage as being 20% less for the purpose of receiving wounds. You ignore the effects of one wound you are suffering from; any time you're wounded you may continue to ignore the current wound, or change to the newly-inflicted one.</p>
<p>All your movement is reduced by 10%. This applies to your normal movement speed based on AGI, jutsu which allow you to travel (such as Vaulting Leap or Exploding Water Shockwave), and even knockback effects from your enemies.</p>
<h5>Killer</h5>
<p>You were born to do this. As a ninja, you know all about how the body works. It's a frail bag made of skin, surrounding squishy parts that are easily penetrable. You have either learned the workings of the body, or perhaps you're just a bit more brutal, disregarding the fact that your opponents are living creatures. Whatever way it works out, you are a natural born killer, though sometimes you get a bit caught up in all of it.</p>
<p>Your attacks count as doing 25% more damage for the purposes of wounds, but you may choose to lower the severity of any wounds you inflict by one category. Whenever you roll for the location of a wound you inflict, you may raise or lower the result by DEX/5, after determining what its normal effect would be.</p>
<p>Aside from all that, you start with 5 ranks in the Medicine skill, and also have its maximum ranks increased by 4; knowing how to maim people requires knowing at least a bit about how they work.</p>
<p>You have a -1 penalty to all your defenses.</p>
<h5>Large</h5>
<p>Your body is muscular, taller, wider, or otherwise... bigger, than other people's. Perhaps you're broad-shouldered and muscular but within the realm of plausibility, or maybe you're a seven foot tall brute; ninja can be downright abnormal.</p>
<p>You use STR/12, rather than STR/15, to calculate your physical damage bonus, and your physical attacks all have +1 range. In addition to hitting hard, you're tough to take down: you add (STR+RES) to your maximum Vitality, and (RES) to your maximum HP, on top of their normal values. Finally, you have a +3 bonus to Stamina rolls.</p>
<p>All attacks that benefit from this unique have their base Speed increased by 2.</p>

<h5>Lucky</h5>
<p>Most things seem to go your way, be it from natural talent or you just happen to pray to the right luck gods! Finding money on the ground or seeing the footprints of an enemy ninja, it all comes to you naturally, and easily, as if you didn't have to work for it at all!</p>
<p>On any non-combat roll, you roll {2d20.takeHighest(1)} instead of 1d20, and 2+EXP/1000 times per day you can reroll any roll, or allow a (willing) ally to reroll any roll. You can force an enemy to reroll, which takes two of your rerolls, and may only be done to a single person once per battle.</p>
<p>When you have no rerolls left, you take a -2 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls.</p>
<h5>Naturalist</h5>
<p>You are at one with nature! Animals like you more, you understand nature like one of them, and your energy is naturally powerful. You also can forage well, notice slight differences in the environment to follow footprints, or even see the handwork ninja leave with their traps! Perhaps kind because of your attunement, or tempted by your primal urges, you are still a great asset.</p>
<p>Your maximum ranks in Survival are increased by 3, and you gain a +3 bonus to detect, disarm, or avoid any part of a trap. Your ninjutsu damage bonus is CHA/12, rather than CHA/15. You have a +1 bonus to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls per rank of the jutsu you're using (+1 for E-rank, +2 for D-rank, etc.)</p>
<p>However, your maximum Research ranks are reduced by 3.</p>
<h5>Nimble</h5>
<p>You are very fast, but more importantly you know how to shift your weight to make it easy to bound walls, scamper up to rooftops, weave through tree branches, and jump kick enemies.</p>
<p>You have +1 Accuracy and a +3 bonus to Stealth and Athletics rolls. You move 20% faster, and on top of that the dodge penalty for not being able to reach the edge of an area-of-effect technique is halved for you. However, if you're ever hit by an AoE attack you take 10% more damage.</p>
<h5>Small</h5>
<p>You are short, spry, and easily toppled over. The last one's not so good, but your diminutive frame makes it harder for others to keep track of you, while allowing you to squeeze into tight spaces and narrowly dodge attacks. You have a +2 bonus to dodge, and your Dodge interrupt's Speed is changed to 1. If its Speed is somehow raised (such as due to Paralysis) you may still always use it. On the other hand, damage from attacks is considered 10% higher for determining what wounds you receive.</p>
<h5>Skilled Shinobi</h5>
<p>While you don't excel in combat, you're able to grasp the fundamental skills and concepts important to being a ninja. You have an extra XP/75 Skill Points to spend, and your skill maximums are increased by 2. However, you have a -1 Accuracy penalty.</p>
<h5>Specialist</h5>
<p>You excel in a particular style of ninja combat, and since noticing that strength you have focused on what you are best at. Be it extraordinary kicks, incredible lightning bolts, or masterful illusions, you are a cut above the rest.</p>
<p>Choose either Taijutsu, Ninjutsu, or Genjutsu. Whichever one you chose has +2 Accuracy, -2 to any necessary Seal Speeds, and a 10% bonus to its damage moves; if Taijutsu, you also have a +2 bonus to Stamina rolls. Genjutsu gives +3 to all your Genjutsu rolls. Next, choose one of the two that you didn't pick. It has -2 Accuracy (or -2 to all Genjutsu rolls), +3 to any required Seal Speeds, and does 10% less damage; if Taijutsu, you also have a -2 penalty to all Stamina rolls.</p>
<h5>Strong-Willed</h5>
<p>When the going gets tough, you keep on going. You have a strong, virtually unbreakable will, and will power through anything standing in your way.</p>
<p>You have a +2 bonus to your defensive Genjutsu rolls. Once per battle, you can activate this unique as a Speed 0 action. When you do so, you lower your Fatigue by 1 level (though keep your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties). You may also choose one Wound you're suffering from, and ignore all of it's effects. This lasts until the end of combat, at which point the Fatigue and Wounds return.</p>
<h5>Warder</h5>
<p>You've trained hard to become adept at brushing aside incoming objects that are liable to hurt you! This is useful for shinobi-related activities such as not dying.</p>
<p>Your Parry action becomes a Speed 2 Interrupt, and has a +2 bonus. This also extends to ninjutsu-based defenses reliant upon Accuracy rolls; those jutsu have their base Speed reduced by 2, as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can parry weapons with your bare hands (catching the blade, striking an opponent's arm to knock their blow aside, and so on), or unarmed attacks with a weapon. In the case of parrying unarmed attacks with weapons, however, your normal +2 bonus becomes a -2 instead. (This does not apply to weapons which could parry unarmed attacks without this unique!)</p>
<p>Your reliance on standing your ground while responding to attacks, however, results in a -2 dodge penalty.</p>
