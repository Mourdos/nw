<p>====================</p>
<h5>1. Hiding</h5>
<p>Ninja hide. It's sort of their... thing. That said, hiding can be accomplished under one of four circumstances:</p>
<p>Nobody is watching you. Well, nobody you're trying to hide from. This automatically prevents usage in combat, though see the other two situations.</p>
<p>Everyone you are trying to hide from has a -6 or higher visibility penalty.</p>
<p>You are already hidden, and taking another Hide action in hopes of getting a new, higher Stealth TN.</p>
<p>You use a jutsu which explicitly allows you to hide as one of its effects. Note that when you hide this way, the Hide action itself is reduced to Speed 0.</p>
<p>Once you meet one of those requirements, you may hide. Hiding is, of course, an action! When hidden, you may not be targeted by enemy attacks (because they don't know where you are!). It's possible to be hidden from some people, but not others.</p>
<h6>a. Hide (Speed 10)</h6>
<p>Make a Stealth skill roll; the result becomes your "Stealth TN" (target number), how hard it is to find you. You are hidden at level 1 Stealth.</p>
<p>For every time you've hidden in a battle, your future Stealth rolls to hide have a -5 penalty (the third time you hid yourself, you'd have a -10 penalty; this applies even if you're hiding with jutsu or other effects).</p>
<h6>b. Improve Hiding (Speed 7)</h6>
<p>This action may be performed only while hiding at level 1 stealth. You take the time to make sure you're properly hidden and settle into place, moving you up to level 2 stealth. In case that wasn't clear, this cannot, by itself, take you from level 2 to level 3 stealth.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>2. Stealth Levels</h5>
<p>There are three levels of stealth, corresponding to different degrees of being hidden. Each level has limitations on what can be done on it; for example, in Level 2 and Level 3 Stealth, you cannot move. Thus, if you were at Stealth 3, and chose to spend an action moving, you would immediately be dropped to Stealth 1.</p>
<h6>a. Stealth, Level 1</h6>
<p>Stealth 1 is as poorly concealed as you can be while still being unseen by your enemies. Your Stealth TN has no bonus at this rank. You may move and perform surprise attacks, as well as using items.</p>
<h6>b. Stealth, Level 2</h6>
<p>Stealth 2 corresponds to being fairly well-hidden, having taken the time to adjust yourself and your hiding spot as necessary--you're not sticking your feet out past the edge of the rock you're hiding behind, for example. From Stealth 2 you may perform surprise attacks, use items, and prepare and perform sneak attacks. At this level of stealth, your Stealth TN has a +5 bonus.</p>
<h6>c. Stealth, Level 3</h6>
<p>Stealth 3 is as well-hidden as you can be. You are somehow camouflaged, blending into your environment excellently. You may not move or attack, but your Stealth TN has a +15 bonus.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>3. Searching</h5>
<p>Understandably, situations arise when ninja want to find other, hidden ninja.</p>
<h6>a. Search (Speed 6)</h6>
<p>You look for hidden enemies, using your keen ninja senses. When you make this action, roll your Awareness skill and compare it to the Stealth TNs of all hidden enemies. If you get equal to or greater than someone's Stealth TN, you have found them. As far as you're concerned, they're no longer in stealth; they cannot perform surprise or sneak attacks against you, you can attack them, and so forth.</p>
<p>Every time you use a Search action consecutively (without taking a non-Interrupt action between them) you get a stacking +2 bonus. Thus, your third attempt to find someone would use your Awareness skill +4.</p>
<p>If you are the one doing the hiding, you do not automatically know that someone has discovered yor hiding place; until they do something indicating they know where you are (such as attacking you, or running straight at you), you think you're still hidden from them.</p>
<h6>b. Point Out (Speed 3)</h6>
<p>You indicate where an enemy is hiding, typically by pointing at them and yelling "There he is!" loudly. This allows anyone else present to make a Search action immediately, as a Speed 0 Interrupt, with an additional +5 bonus.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h5>4. Actions From Stealth</h5>
<h6>a. Surprise Attack</h6>
<p>Any attack you make while hidden is a surprise attack. Performing a surprise attack ends your stealth, as you leap out and attack, or otherwise reveal your location in the process.</p>
<p>If an opponent chooses to use an Interrupt to defend against your surprise attack, they may not lower its Speed by spending Action Points.</p>
<p>Non-jutsu attacks with ranged weapons do not end your stealth. However, each time you perform one it reduces your Stealth TN by 5.</p>
<h6>b. Prepare Sneak Attack (Speed Variable, Abort)</h6>
<p>You take the time to line up a perfect attack. You may abort this action at any time, either as a normal abort, or to make your next action a sneak attack.</p>
<p>To use an action as a sneak attack, the total Speed that you used your Prepare Sneak Attack action for must be at least equal to that of the action you're using as a sneak attack. If you take another action instead (such as moving to a new hiding spot, via another use of the Hide action), you lose your opportunity to Sneak Attack.</p>
<h6>c. Sneak Attack</h6>
<p>A sneak attack is an improved surprise attack, and as such, all normal rules for surprise attacks apply. Additionally, any Accuracy penalties inherent to the technique or weapon you're using are removed. Penalties from other sources, such as visibility or wounds, are not negated.</p>
<p>A sneak attack may be used as a special type of Interrupt. You can Interrupt any action, taken by any person, with a sneak attack. They may either complete their action, and be automatically hit by your sneak attack, or call off their action and defend against your attack normally. If they call their action off they do not pay its cost, but their next action is still determined by their action's normal Speed.</p>
<p>Sneak attacks may interrupt other actions as if their Speed was 1/4 is actual value. For example, you have been preparing a sneak attack for 18 initiative counts, when your opponent declares a basic unarmed attack (Speed 8) against your ally, on IC 80. You declare a sneak attack interrupt. You use a taijutsu technique which normally has 30 Speed; you spend 14 action points to lower its Speed to 16 (less than your 18 ICs of preparation). It now interrupts as if it was Speed (16/4 =) 4, which is half of the unarmed attack's 8, making it a valid interrupt. Your opponent would be wise to call off their attack; if they do so, they will not roll Stamina for their attack, they'll have their next action on IC 88, and they can defend with any Interrupt of Speed 8 (16/2 = 8) or lower.</p>
<h6>d. Genjutsu</h6>
<p>Genjutsu can be used from level 1 and 2 stealth, and unlike other jutsus does not break your concealment. However, it can never be a sneak or surprise attack. Genjutsu techniques which require your opponent to be able to perceive you cannot, for reasons that should be largely self-evident, be used on somebody who you're hiding from.</p>
