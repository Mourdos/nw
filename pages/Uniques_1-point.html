<h3>1 Point Uniques</h3>
<h5>Alert</h5>
<p>As far as ninja are concerned, real ninja, you are their worst nightmare. You can see beyond the unseen, making you a feared weapon. Your max ranks in Awareness are increased by 3 and your ranks in Blind Fighting are considered 1 higher (even above the normal maximum). You have a +3 bonus to Espionage rolls.</p>
<h5>Blur</h5>
<p>It's hard to tell where you actually are. Not because they can't see you, but because you never seem to stay still long enough for their eyes to stop trailing you and be able to focus. You never stop to let inertia win out. When you dodge successfully you may move as many yards as if you'd taken a Speed 3 Move action. When you move towards an enemy as part of an attack, you may move up to that action's full Speed worth, rather than half. Upgrades Into: Exceptionally Fast</p>
<h5>Close Ties</h5>
<p>Your allies are incredibly important to you, each valued as much as a close friend. You form bonds fast, and they can last for life. Your mere presence raises morale! Your allies get a +2 bonus to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, raised to +3 if they're from your village. A single person can only benefit from one ally with Close Ties at a time.</p>
<p>So long as your allies are with you, you excel in the face of adversity. For every ally present with you in battle you gain a +1 bonus to your own Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, up to a maximum of +3. Upgrades Into: Avenger, Protector</p>
<h5>Elementally Gifted</h5>
<p>While most shinobi struggle to learn the basics of elemental control, you took to it like a fish to water (or a bird to wind, or... you know what, this joke is just bad). Your early aptitude is the first sign of a potential that'll leave even many experienced shinobi envious. You can use an element of your choice as if you had the Elemental Aptitude ability for it, without actually having to use one of your ranks of Elemental Aptitude. Upgrades Into: Elementalist</p>
<h5>Expansive Chakra</h5>
<p>Chakra flows readily through your body and into your jutsu, allowing you to effortlessly mold it into techniques. The Chakra costs for all your jutsu are reduced by 1 per rank (1 for E-rank, 2 for D-rank), and you ninjutsu damage bonus is increased by half that amount (0.5 for E-rank, 1 for D-rank, and so forth). Upgrades Into: Boundless Chakra</p>
<h5>Full Pockets</h5>
<p>You were born into money! Or you stole a lot of it, but through some means you happen to be a very rich and resourceful ninja. Be it tools, traps, or weapons, you are always ready for any situation. When you spend XP on money, you get double the normal amount per rank. If you need to make an Espionage roll to bribe someone, it has a +5 bonus. What's more, you may spend Requisition spontaneously, even in the middle of a mission, representing you having just the right thing for the task at hand. Done in combat, this is a Speed 2 action.</p>
<h5>Hidden Potential</h5>
<p>You and your peers both have yet to realize the full extent of your capabilities. Maybe you just haven't found your niche, maybe you're a late bloomer, or maybe something's holding you back. Until you find out what it is, you have +1 Willpower. Upgrades Into: Any 2- or 3-point unique.</p>
<h5>Indefatigable</h5>
<p>(adj) 1. (of a person or their efforts) Persisting tirelessly That's what you are! You have a +1 bonus to Stamina rolls per rank of the jutsu being used (+1 for E-ranks, +2 for D-ranks, etc.); in the case of basic attacks, this becomes a +2 bonus. Additionally, when you Rest your Stamina penalty is lowered by an additional 1 point. Upgrades Into: Endless Energy</p>
<h5>Killing Intent</h5>
<p>You have what it takes to end a person's life. Even if you personally would choose not to, it's not because you lack the capacity. Something about you gives that away, that killer's instinct having seeped into your very chakra. Whenever you inflict a wound upon someone, roll 1d20+XP/100 against that person's 1d20+XP/100, +1 for every previous wound you've inflicted in battle. If they fail, they receive a Stun with a severity of how much you beat their roll by.</p>
<h5>Lightfoot</h5>
<p>You've always been talented at sneaking and hiding in almost any and all places. Whether a dark shadow or henge'd as a tissue box in a room, you know how make your presence scarce.</p>
<p>You have a +3 bonus to Stealth rolls, and the speed of your Hide action is reduced by 3. You can move when in Stealth 2 without lowering the level of your stealth. Upgrades Into: Skirmisher</p>
<h5>Martial Prowess</h5>
<p>You're adept at turning a fight into a one-man training montage with your enemy being a rag doll disoriented by every blow. You have no need for weapons: You are the weapon.</p>
<p>Your Combos are not broken from attacking a new target, or from taking damage from an attack made by someone other than your initial target. You gain a +3 bonus to Counter Combo opposed rolls, and your Combos inflict a (Combo Counter -2) Stun, which is doubled when using a Finisher. Additionally, your combos are not broken by a Stun of a severity less than (Combo Counter +2). Upgrades Into: Bruiser</p>
<h5>Nimble Hands</h5>
<p>You have always been able to pick things up, spin them between your fingers, throw things just right, and otherwise use your hands well. You may throw up to DEX/8 weapons with a multi-throw, reduce Seal Speeds and the Speed of ranged attacks by 2, and may draw weapons without any sort of action. You may sheathe weapons as a Speed 0 action. Upgrades Into: Ranged Specialist, Single-Handed Seals</p>
<h5>Restrained</h5>
<p>You know just how much force you're applying, and how to, when necessary, apply less. This is good when doing handiwork, but also when fighting someone who you don't want to kill or maim.</p>
<p>Any time you inflict damage, after determining what the wound would be you may activate this unique. The attack's damage is reduced by 25%, and the wound it inflicted (based on its original damage) is reduced by one category. When you use this to lower the severity of a wound you get a +1 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls for the rest of the battle, to a maximum of +5.</p>
<p>Preventing a wound this way will not stop it from ending any Genjutsu the victim was suffering from.</p>
<p>When an attack you make would prove lethal, you may instead hold back at the last moment. This leaves your victim at 0 HP (or, if they were below 0 HP, they aren't reduced any further), raises the severity of any wounds you inflicted by 1 (and cannot be combined with a normal activation of this unique), but prevents your attack from being fatal. Upgrades Into: Avenger, Protector</p>
<h5>Seal Master</h5>
<p>You're really, really good with handseals. You make them fast, and mold your chakra just as rapidly. It could be natural talent... but, honestly, you know what it probably was? Probably when you were a kid you were incredibly obsessed with being a super-cool ninja, so you spent all your free time making fake handseals and pretending to shoot fireballs at your friends. Anyway, you reduce Seal Speeds by Dex/8 (instead of Dex/10), and any jutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has a 10% bonus to its damage. Upgrades Into: Jutsu Master, Single-Handed Seals</p>
<h5>Weapon Master</h5>
<p>You know your weapons. You know how to use them, and how to change them to suit your style. Your Weapon Focus ability applies to all weapons, only needing to be taken once, and it only increases Stamina costs by 2 per rank. Additionally, that ability's limit is changed to (DEX -30)/20, maximum 4. If you take this after creation, you may refund your extra Weapon Focus Upgrades Into: Ranged Specialist</p>
<h5>Weight Trainer</h5>
<p>You strap yourself down with weights--either from tailoring your clothes that way, or from strapping weights to your limbs--and hamper yourself constantly. All in the name of one. Perfect. Fight.</p>
<p>Once per two months you can remove the weights as Speed 10 to have your STR, DEX, and AGI improve to 120% of their regular values, for that fight only. These attribute adjustments do not raise your Vitality or HP.</p>
<p>Due to your hard training your maximum and current Athletics ranks are increased by 2.</p>
