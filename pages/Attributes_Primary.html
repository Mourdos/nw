<h3>1. Primary Attributes</h3>
<p>Attributes (also commonly referred to as statistics, or 'stats' for short) are numerical representations of your character's overall physical condition: how strong they are, how fast they are, and so forth. They are the baseline for determining performance.</p>
<p>The five primary attributes make up, in game terms, the core of a character's capabilities.</p>
<p>Baseline 'normal human' stats are around 20. Ninja characters will quickly exceed these numbers. This is a result of them learning to harness the chakra in their body, and benefiting from the symbiotic relationship that chakra has with their body.</p>
<h5>Strength (STR)</h5>
<p>Strength is a measurement of your ability to exert physical force on the world around you. Exceptionally strong people may be correspondingly muscular, though ninja have developed many training methods which leave them deceptively lean.</p>
<p>Your physical damage bonus is STR/15.</p>
<p>Your Vitality is (RES multiplies 8 + STR multiplies 4)</p>
<h5>Resilience (RES)</h5>
<p>This is your body's ability to endure hardship without suffering from debilitating injuries. Many ninja believe that it's best to avoid being hit entirely... but nobody will say that not being able to take a blow is a good thing.</p>
<p>RES/10 is your bonus to Stamina rolls.</p>
<p>Your Vitality is (RES multiplies 8 + STR multiplies 4)</p>
<p>Your HP is (RES multiplies 3 + CHA)</p>
<h5>Chakra (CHA)</h5>
<p>Every ninja is fueled by chakra, a mystical force that suffuses the world and fills the bodies of all living things, much like 'ki' in certain belief systems. This stat measures both your reserves of raw chakra and your ability to harness them.</p>
<p>Your ninjutsu damage bonus is CHA/15.</p>
<p>You add CHA/10 to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.</p>
<h5>Dexterity (DEX)</h5>
<p>Representing your deftness, precision, and ability to quickly respond to changes in your environment, dexterity is very important in combat, as it is what enables you to actually hit things that are moving (such as other ninja).</p>
<p>Your base Accuracy bonus is DEX/10.</p>
<p>Seal Speed of jutsu you perform is reduced by DEX/10.</p>
<h5>Agility (AGI)</h5>
<p>The sister attribute to dexterity, agility is how quickly you can react to danger, how fast you can move, and, as the name suggests, how agile you are overall.</p>
<p>You add AGI/10 to your Dodge rolls.</p>
<p>You add AGI/10 to your Initiative rolls.</p>
