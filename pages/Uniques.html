<h3>Uniques</h3>
<p>Uniques are one of the many ways in which you can customize your character, giving you effects and capabilities that typically cannot be acquired otherwise. You gain four Unique Points to spend at character creation. Uniques are grouped by cost, with Creation Uniques all costing 1 point each.</p>
<h5>Creation uniques</h5>
<p>Uniques which may only be taken when you first make your character, and you may only have two of them. However, you may save your unique points for later, if you want.</p>
<p>As your character advances in rank, they'll gain more unique points. You can either save these for later, spend them to acquire new uniques, or use them to upgrade existing ones. Regardless, you may only take a single unique once; you cannot, for example, take Endless Energy twice to get double its bonuses.</p>
<p>Some uniques have, below their descriptions, entries such as "Upgrades Into" and "Upgrades From." To upgrade a unique, you need to pay the difference between the cost of your current unique and the cost of the unique you will be upgrading it to. When you do this, you remove the old unique and replace it with the new one. This does mean that you might lose some effects entirely in the process.</p>
<p>For example, say you had the 1-point Expansive Chakra. You later become a Chuunin, and gain your fifth and sixth unique point. You spend one of them to upgrade your unique to the 2-point Boundless Chakra; you gain the new unique's benefits, but lose Expansive Chakra's cost reduction. Finally, you become a Jounin and use one of the unique points you get then to finish by upgrading Boundless Chakra into either one of its 3-point versions, Regenerative Chakra or Surging Power.</p>
