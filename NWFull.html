====================<br>
1. Explanation<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
This is a bare-bones walkthrough for character creation. It's best if
you're at least partly familiar with the PHB before making your
character, but you can get by without that.<br>
<br>
The first step of making a character should be settling on a concept:
if you're familiar with the series, you may already know which village
or clan you want to be from. If you already have a concept (who your
character is, where they're from, what their personality's like, what
they're good at) then most of creation should be easy for you.<br>
<br>
If you don't, feel free to just make it up as you go along. You might
find inspiration along the way, especially if it's your first time
making a character. Don't be afraid to ask for help!<br>
<br>
Please note that when rolling your attributes, you need to find a Roll
Watcher (RW), Storyteller (ST), or Gamemaster (GM) can be recorded in
the game's roster. You will also need to inform the RW of your chosen
clan and Creation Uniques (see below).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Village and Clan<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
First, choose which of the three playable Hidden Villages your
character is from. This is where your character was trained, who
they're loyal to, and ultimately who they work for. The culture between
villages does vary, and you may want to read the Village Information
nodes, but for the most part it's okay if you don't fit the mold of
your home village--ninja are expected to be a little... odd.<br>
<br>
Every village is home to several ninja clans. Clans have special
techniques dependent on their bloodline or closely-guarded secrets,
which you won't be able to learn otherwise. If you want, you may choose
a single clan from your village to be from.<br>
<br>
Choosing a clan is not mandatory, and clanless characters receive a 10%
XP bonus--something that's discussed in detail in the Advancement
chapter--and slightly more skill points.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Choose Uniques<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
As a starting character, you have 4 Unique Points (UP) to spend, unless
your clan specifies you have less. You may spend these all at creation,
or save some (or even all) of them for later use if you prefer. You'll
get more UP later, but they're few and far between, and the Creation
uniques may only be purchased with your starting UP.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Pick Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The next step is to determine your five core attributes: Strength
(STR), Resilience (RES), Chakra (CHA), Dexterity (DEX), and Agility
(AGI).<br>
<br>
You start with 20 in all stats. <br>
<br>
After that, you have 25 points to distribute among the attributes, with
no more than ten in a single stat.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Starting Skills<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Unless modified by one of your uniques, you have (total XP)/25 Skill
Points (which should come out to 4), which you can spend on any of the
game's 10 skills. Now would be a good time to spend them, though don't
stress about it too much.<br>
<br>
If you're clanless, you have XP/20 Skill Points instead. That's 5, if
you were wondering.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
6. Spend Starting XP<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
You have three options for a character.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
a. 100 XP, but you get a bonus talent at 500xp.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
b. 1000 XP, but gain the Chuunin rank to begin. &lt;Br&gt;<br>
c. 1500 XP, Start as a genin.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
As a starting character you'll probably want to purchase a rank of the
Elemental Aptitude ability (in the Chakra category), and the E-rank
Ninjutsu techniques Kawarimi, Henge, and Bunshin. These are by no means
mandatory, but they're very useful to have. Some ranks in the Money:
Requisition ability are also a good idea, if you want to be able to
carry equipment with you.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, take whatever you think makes the most sense for your
character.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
### 1. Primary Attributes<br>
<br>
<br>
Attributes (also commonly referred to as statistics, or 'stats' for
short) are numerical representations of your character's overall
physical condition: how strong they are, how fast they are, and so
forth. They are the baseline for determining performance.<br>
<br>
The five primary attributes make up, in game terms, the core of a
character's capabilities.<br>
<br>
Baseline 'normal human' stats are around 20. Ninja characters will
quickly exceed these numbers. This is a result of them learning to
harness the chakra in their body, and benefiting from the symbiotic
relationship that chakra has with their body.<br>
<br>
#### Strength (STR)<br>
Strength is a measurement of your ability to exert physical force on
the world around you. Exceptionally strong people may be
correspondingly muscular, though ninja have developed many training
methods which leave them deceptively lean.<br>
&nbsp;- Your physical damage bonus is STR/15.<br>
&nbsp;- Your Vitality is (RES multiplies 8 + STR multiplies 4)<br>
<br>
#### Resilience (RES)<br>
This is your body's ability to endure hardship without suffering from
debilitating injuries. Many ninja believe that it's best to avoid being
hit entirely... but nobody will say that not being able to take a blow
is a good thing.<br>
&nbsp;- RES/10 is your bonus to Stamina rolls.<br>
&nbsp;- Your Vitality is (RES multiplies 8 + STR multiplies 4)<br>
&nbsp;- Your HP is&nbsp; (RES multiplies 3 + CHA)<br>
<br>
#### Chakra (CHA)<br>
Every ninja is fueled by chakra, a mystical force that suffuses the
world and fills the bodies of all living things, much like 'ki' in
certain belief systems. This stat measures both your reserves of raw
chakra and your ability to harness them.<br>
&nbsp;- Your ninjutsu damage bonus is CHA/15.<br>
&nbsp;- You add CHA/10 to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.<br>
<br>
#### Dexterity (DEX)<br>
Representing your deftness, precision, and ability to quickly respond
to changes in your environment, dexterity is very important in combat,
as it is what enables you to actually hit things that are moving (such
as other ninja).<br>
&nbsp;- Your base Accuracy bonus is DEX/10.<br>
&nbsp;- Seal Speed of jutsu you perform is reduced by DEX/10.<br>
<br>
#### Agility (AGI)<br>
The sister attribute to dexterity, agility is how quickly you can react
to danger, how fast you can move, and, as the name suggests, how agile
you are overall.<br>
&nbsp;- You add AGI/10 to your Dodge rolls.<br>
&nbsp;- You add AGI/10 to your Initiative rolls.<br>
&lt;div style='margin-top:140px'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;div style='margin-top:140px'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
<br>
### 2.Derived Attributes<br>
<br>
#### Vitality<br>
Vitality measures your character's ability to shrug off damage, to turn
a dangerous blow into a glancing one, and to take a beating without
being seriously injured. You have a current and maximum vitality;
whenever you take damage, you reduce your current vitality by that
amount, though your maximum Vitality is unaffected.<br>
Your vitality equals your (RES *8 + STR *4).<br>
<br>
#### Hit Points (HP)<br>
Hit points are like your 'life force', representing injuries that have
significantly harmed you and caused serious damage to your body. After
your Vitality reaches 0, you take damage to your Hit Points; an attack
which depletes your Vitality has the rest of its damage carry over into
your HP.<br>
You have (RES *3 + CHA) Hit Points.<br>
<br>
####&nbsp; Damage Bonus, Physical<br>
As the name would suggest, this increases the damage you do with
physical attacks. Full details on how can be found in the Combat
chapter. Your damage bonus is STR/15. Damage bonus is unique in that it
is calculated to a single decimal place. For example, with STR of 25,
you'd have a damage bonus of 25/15.0 = 1.666 = 1.6<br>
<br>
#### Damage Bonus, Ninjutsu<br>
This functions identically to physical damage bonus, with two
differences. The first, it is determined by your CHA/15; the second, it
applies to attacks based on their potency of your chakra rather than
your physical strength, which generally means ninjutsu.<br>
<br>
####&nbsp; Willpower<br>
Your overall strength of will. This is both your raw determination, and
your confidence in your body's ability to keep going, and perform at a
higher level, even when it, well, can't.<br>
Your Willpower is calculated as (STR + RES + CHA + DEX + AGI)/100, with
a minimum of 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
## Uniques <br>
Uniques are one of the many ways in which you can customize your
character, giving you effects and capabilities that typically cannot be
acquired otherwise. You gain four Unique Points to spend at character
creation. Uniques are grouped by cost, with Creation Uniques all
costing 1 point each.<br>
<br>
### Creation uniques <br>
Uniques which may only be taken when you first make your character, and
you may only have two of them. However, you may save your unique points
for later, if you want.<br>
<br>
As your character advances in rank, they'll gain more unique points.
You can either save these for later, spend them to acquire new uniques,
or use them to upgrade existing ones. Regardless, you may only take a
single unique once; you cannot, for example, take Endless Energy twice
to get double its bonuses.<br>
<br>
Some uniques have, below their descriptions, entries such as
&amp;quot;Upgrades Into&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Upgrades
From.&amp;quot; To upgrade a unique, you need to pay the difference
between the cost of your current unique and the cost of the unique you
will be upgrading it to. When you do this, you remove the old unique
and replace it with the new one. This does mean that you might lose
some effects entirely in the process.<br>
<br>
<br>
For example, say you had the 1-point Expansive Chakra. You later become
a Chuunin, and gain your fifth and sixth unique point. You spend one of
them to upgrade your unique to the 2-point Boundless Chakra; you gain
the new unique's benefits, but lose Expansive Chakra's cost reduction.
Finally, you become a Jounin and use one of the unique points you get
then to finish by upgrading Boundless Chakra into either one of its
3-point versions, Regenerative Chakra or Surging Power.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyst<br>
You like to study everything you can about people, their actions, their
routines, as well as everything around you. This can be distracting at
times, but usually it'll give you a good grasp of the situation and
your surroundings.<br>
<br>
You have a +3 bonus to Awareness, and whenever you take a Rest action
you gain 5 AP. You begin combat with 10 AP and if someone uses the same
type of attack (Katon, Weapon Taijutsu, etc.) in succession you get a
+2 to your defenses. This does not stack.<br>
<br>
You have a -5 penalty to your choice of either Espionage, Stealth, or
Survival (your choice). Your observational powers come at a price!<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Berserker<br>
A beast of a ninja you are, and you act like one too! You get angry
easily, and often make rash, terrible decisions out of being
bull-headed. At least you're hard to take down when things come to
combat (as they often do).<br>
<br>
You add an extra STR*2 to your Vitality, can fight until -25%
HP,&nbsp; and can opt to not take a defensive action in response to
an enemy's attack. If their attack Wounds you, you can choose which
location it hits (unless the attack is a called shot). Assuming you're
still standing, you can then immediately counteract, using any physical
attack at your disposal, even though it's not your action. This attack
is made at half its normal Speed, cannot have its Speed reduced
further, and has a +3 Accuracy bonus.<br>
<br>
This attack must be directed at the person who attacked you. Its base
Speed cannot be greater than the base Speed of the attack which
provoked it.<br>
<br>
When you fall below 20% Vitality in combat, you can choose to
immediately surrender or keep fighting. If you keep fighting, you won't
stop until you're unconscious, or all your opponents have surrendered
or been incapacitated<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Competitive<br>
You always want to win every race, hit the bull's-eye first, and beat
everyone in every game you play. In fights, winning is your everything;
that can be good, since losing a fight as a ninja may have fatal
consequences.<br>
<br>
You gain 3 bonus XP for winning a sparring match or fight, all your
attacks do an extra 5% damage, and you gain a +2 to all d20 rolls.
Whenever you miss with an attack, you become increasingly frustrated
and driven to land a solid blow on your enemy. This gives you a -1
penalty to all your d20 rolls, but also a +1 bonus to Accuracy, up to a
maximum of -5 and +5 respectively (attacks with accuracy rolls use the
accuracy bonus, not the d20 roll penalty). These both reset to 0 when
you hit someone.<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Defender<br>
Throwing solid blocks, you've honed your reflexes and worked your bones
and tendons hard so that your twitch reflex is all you need to keep
yourself safe.<br>
<br>
You can use the Block defense as a Speed 5 Interrupt. This does have
one downside: If you're Stunned when you do this, your Block reduces
the incoming attack's damage by 25% less than it normally would. When
you don't block, you reduce the damage you take by RES/5 and treat the
damage as if it was 20% lower when determining what Wounds you receive.
Finally, anyone who makes an unarmed attack against you takes your
STR/2 damage, whether or not you block--punching you hurts!<br>
<br>
The focus on self-preservation, however, has left you more cautious
than most even when attacking. The damage of all your attacks is
considered 10% lower for determining what wounds they cause. This
doesn't apply to Jutsu which explicitly increase the damage for
wounding purposes.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Energetic<br>
Running, jumping, swimming, fighting; none of it seems to tire you out.
Eventually you'll wear down, but not until long after your friends are
left staggering around and panting for breath. On the other hand, it's
hard to sit still and focus, let alone study, when you're more or less
hyperactive.<br>
<br>
You have 6 levels of Fatigue instead of the usual 5, and suffer Fatigue
penalties (-1 Accuracy, -2 defenses, and so on) as if you were one
Fatigue category lower, while retaining the regular benefits. However,
your maximum ranks in all skills are reduced by 3.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Genius<br>
The term 'genius' has a different meaning to ninja than ordinary
people. It's not a measure of intelligence, but rather how easily one
can understand the concepts behind ninja techniques. The smartest
shinobi alive might not be called a genius, but a Genin using advanced
jutsu certainly would. Ninja are just kind of like that.<br>
<br>
Your natural talent may allow you to be lazy and smug, or it could
motivate you on to further greatness. The cost to learn jutsu is
halved! Round up, if necessary. Additionally you get your first three
Talents at 750, 2000, and 3750 XP (instead of 1000, 2500, and 4500),
and another 1 Talent Point every 1250 XP thereafter (instead of 1500
XP, normally). Finally, you become able to learn D-rank jutsu at 100
XP, C-rank jutsu at 300 XP, B-ranks at 2000, and A-ranks at 4000,
without needing to meet any skill or rank requirements.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, you're not without your limitations. This doesn't allow
you to ignore other requirements, such as Abilities or Talents.
Additionally, it doesn't allow you to ignore requirements specific to
individual techniques (such as the Poison Cloud or Telescope
Tecniques). Furthermore, reaching beyond your grasp has a cost. Any
jutsu you couldn't use without Genius' effects has its damage treated
as being 20% lower for the purposes of causing wounds.<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Juggernaut<br>
You are a solid, hulking brute. You aren't necessarily tall, but you
condition yourself hard and have always had a natural gift at receiving
pain! Massive, solid forearm muscles and tendons, strong shins, you are
a rough opponent to face.<br>
<br>
You reduce all damage you take by RES/4, and treat damage as being 20%
less for the purpose of receiving wounds. You ignore the effects of one
wound you are suffering from; any time you're wounded you may continue
to ignore the current wound, or change to the newly-inflicted one.<br>
<br>
All your movement is reduced by 10%. This applies to your normal
movement speed based on AGI, jutsu which allow you to travel (such as
Vaulting Leap or Exploding Water Shockwave), and even knockback effects
from your enemies.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Killer<br>
You were born to do this. As a ninja, you know all about how the body
works. It's a frail bag made of skin, surrounding squishy parts that
are easily penetrable. You have either learned the workings of the
body, or perhaps you're just a bit more brutal, disregarding the fact
that your opponents are living creatures. Whatever way it works out,
you are a natural born killer, though sometimes you get a bit caught up
in all of it.<br>
<br>
Your attacks count as doing 25% more damage for the purposes of wounds,
but you may choose to lower the severity of any wounds you inflict by
one category. Whenever you roll for the location of a wound you
inflict, you may raise or lower the result by DEX/5, after determining
what its normal effect would be.<br>
<br>
Aside from all that, you start with 5 ranks in the Medicine skill, and
also have its maximum ranks increased by 4; knowing how to maim people
requires knowing at least a bit about how they work.<br>
<br>
You have a -1 penalty to all your defenses.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Large<br>
Your body is muscular, taller, wider, or otherwise... bigger, than
other people's. Perhaps you're broad-shouldered and muscular but within
the realm of plausibility, or maybe you're a seven foot tall brute;
ninja can be downright abnormal.<br>
<br>
You use STR/12, rather than STR/15, to calculate your physical damage
bonus, and your physical attacks all have +1 range. In addition to
hitting hard, you're tough to take down: you add (STR+RES) to your
maximum Vitality, and (RES) to your maximum HP, on top of their normal
values. Finally, you have a +3 bonus to Stamina rolls.<br>
<br>
All&nbsp; attacks that benefit from this unique have their base
Speed increased by 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucky<br>
Most things seem to go your way, be it from natural talent or you just
happen to pray to the right luck gods! Finding money on the ground or
seeing the footprints of an enemy ninja, it all comes to you naturally,
and easily, as if you didn't have to work for it at all!<br>
<br>
On any non-combat roll, you roll {2d20.takeHighest(1)} instead of 1d20,
and 2+EXP/1000 times per day you can reroll any roll, or allow a
(willing) ally to reroll any roll. You can force an enemy to reroll,
which takes two of your rerolls, and may only be done to a single
person once per battle.<br>
<br>
When you have no rerolls left, you take a -2 penalty to Accuracy and
d20 rolls.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturalist<br>
You are at one with nature! Animals like you more, you understand
nature like one of them, and your energy is naturally powerful. You
also can forage well, notice slight differences in the environment to
follow footprints, or even see the handwork ninja leave with their
traps! Perhaps kind because of your attunement, or tempted by your
primal urges, you are still a great asset.<br>
<br>
Your maximum ranks in Survival are increased by 3, and you gain a +3
bonus to detect, disarm, or avoid any part of a trap. Your ninjutsu
damage bonus is CHA/12, rather than CHA/15. You have a +1 bonus to your
Chakra Exhaustion rolls per rank of the jutsu you're using (+1 for
E-rank, +2 for D-rank, etc.)<br>
<br>
However, your maximum Research ranks are reduced by 3.<br>
```<br>
```<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Nimble<br>
You are very fast, but more importantly you know how to shift your
weight to make it easy to bound walls, scamper up to rooftops, weave
through tree branches, and jump kick enemies.<br>
<br>
You have +1 Accuracy and a +3 bonus to Stealth and Athletics rolls. You
move 20% faster, and on top of that the dodge penalty for not being
able to reach the edge of an area-of-effect technique is halved for
you. However, if you're ever hit by an AoE attack you take 10% more
damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Small<br>
You are short, spry, and easily toppled over. The last one's not so
good, but your diminutive frame makes it harder for others to keep
track of you, while allowing you to squeeze into tight spaces and
narrowly dodge attacks. You have a +2 bonus to dodge, and your Dodge
interrupt's Speed is changed to 1. If its Speed is somehow raised (such
as due to Paralysis) you may still always use it. On the other hand,
damage from attacks is considered 10% higher for determining what
wounds you receive.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Skilled Shinobi<br>
While you don't excel in combat, you're able to grasp the fundamental
skills and concepts important to being a ninja. You have an extra XP/75
Skill Points to spend, and your skill maximums are increased by 2.
However, you have a -1 Accuracy penalty.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Specialist<br>
You excel in a particular style of ninja combat, and since noticing
that strength you have focused on what you are best at. Be it
extraordinary kicks, incredible lightning bolts, or masterful
illusions, you are a cut above the rest.<br>
<br>
Choose either Taijutsu, Ninjutsu, or Genjutsu. Whichever one you chose
has +2 Accuracy, -2 to any necessary Seal Speeds, and a 10% bonus to
its damage moves; if Taijutsu, you also have a +2 bonus to Stamina
rolls.&nbsp; Genjutsu gives +3 to all your Genjutsu rolls. Next,
choose one of the two that you didn't pick. It has -2 Accuracy (or -2
to all Genjutsu rolls), +3 to any required Seal Speeds, and does 10%
less damage; if Taijutsu, you also have a -2 penalty to all Stamina
rolls.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong-Willed<br>
When the going gets tough, you keep on going. You have a strong,
virtually unbreakable will, and will power through anything standing in
your way.<br>
<br>
You have a +2 bonus to your defensive Genjutsu rolls. Once per battle,
you can activate this unique as a Speed 0 action. When you do so, you
lower your Fatigue by 1 level (though keep your Stamina and Chakra
Exhaustion penalties). You may also choose one Wound you're suffering
from, and ignore all of it's effects. This lasts until the end of
combat, at which point the Fatigue and Wounds return.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Warder<br>
You've trained hard to become adept at brushing aside incoming objects
that are liable to hurt you! This is useful for shinobi-related
activities such as not dying.<br>
<br>
Your Parry action becomes a Speed 2 Interrupt, and has a +2 bonus. This
also extends to ninjutsu-based defenses reliant upon Accuracy rolls;
those jutsu have their base Speed reduced by 2, as well.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you can parry weapons with your bare hands (catching the
blade, striking an opponent's arm to knock their blow aside, and so
on), or unarmed attacks with a weapon. In the case of parrying unarmed
attacks with weapons, however, your normal +2 bonus becomes a -2
instead. (This does not apply to weapons which could parry unarmed
attacks without this unique!)<br>
<br>
Your reliance on standing your ground while responding to attacks,
however, results in a -2 dodge penalty.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
#### 1 Point Uniques<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Alert<br>
As far as ninja are concerned, real ninja, you are their worst
nightmare. You can see beyond the unseen, making you a feared weapon.
Your max ranks in Awareness are increased by 3 and your ranks in Blind
Fighting are considered 1 higher (even above the normal maximum). You
have a +3 bonus to Espionage rolls.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Blur<br>
It's hard to tell where you actually are.&nbsp; Not because they
can't see you, but because you never seem to stay still long enough for
their eyes to stop trailing you and be able to focus.&nbsp; You
never stop to let inertia win out. When you dodge successfully you may
move as many yards as if you'd taken a Speed 3 Move action. When you
move towards an enemy as part of an attack, you may move up to that
action's full Speed worth, rather than half.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Exceptionally Fast<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Close Ties<br>
Your allies are incredibly important to you, each valued as much as a
close friend. You form bonds fast, and they can last for life. Your
mere presence raises morale! Your allies get a +2 bonus to Stamina and
Chakra Exhaustion rolls, raised to +3 if they're from your village. A
single person can only benefit from one ally with Close Ties at a time.<br>
<br>
So long as your allies are with you, you excel in the face of
adversity. For every ally present with you in battle you gain a +1
bonus to your own Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, up to a maximum
of +3.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Avenger, Protector<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Elementally Gifted<br>
While most shinobi struggle to learn the basics of elemental control,
you took to it like a fish to water (or a bird to wind, or... you know
what, this joke is just bad).&nbsp; Your early aptitude is the
first sign of a potential that'll leave even many experienced shinobi
envious. You can use an element of your choice as if you had the
Elemental Aptitude ability for it, without actually having to use one
of your ranks of Elemental Aptitude.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Elementalist<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Expansive Chakra<br>
Chakra flows readily through your body and into your jutsu, allowing
you to effortlessly mold it into techniques. The Chakra costs for all
your jutsu are reduced by 1 per rank (1 for E-rank, 2 for D-rank), and
you ninjutsu damage bonus is increased by half that amount (0.5 for
E-rank, 1 for D-rank, and so forth).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Boundless Chakra<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Full Pockets<br>
You were born into money! Or you stole a lot of it, but through some
means you happen to be a very rich and resourceful ninja. Be it tools,
traps, or weapons, you are always ready for any situation. When you
spend XP on money, you get double the normal amount per rank. If you
need to make an Espionage roll to bribe someone, it has a +5 bonus.
What's more, you may spend Requisition spontaneously, even in the
middle of a mission, representing you having just the right thing for
the task at hand. Done in combat, this is a Speed 2 action.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Hidden Potential<br>
You and your peers both have yet to realize the full extent of your
capabilities. Maybe you just haven't found your niche, maybe you're a
late bloomer, or maybe something's holding you back. Until you find out
what it is, you have +1 Willpower.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Any 2- or 3-point unique.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Indefatigable<br>
(adj) 1. (of a person or their efforts) Persisting tirelessly<br>
That's what you are! You have a +1 bonus to Stamina rolls per rank of
the jutsu being used (+1 for E-ranks, +2 for D-ranks, etc.); in the
case of basic attacks, this becomes a +2 bonus. Additionally, when you
Rest your Stamina penalty is lowered by an additional 1 point.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Endless Energy<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing Intent<br>
You have what it takes to end a person's life. Even if you personally
would choose not to, it's not because you lack the capacity. Something
about you gives that away, that killer's instinct having seeped into
your very chakra. Whenever you inflict a wound upon someone, roll
1d20+XP/100 against that person's 1d20+XP/100, +1 for every previous
wound you've inflicted in battle. If they fail, they receive a Stun
with a severity of how much you beat their roll by.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightfoot<br>
You've always been talented at sneaking and hiding in almost any and
all places. Whether a dark shadow or henge'd as a tissue box in a room,
you know how make your presence scarce.<br>
<br>
You have a +3 bonus to Stealth rolls, and the speed of your Hide action
is reduced by 3. You can move when in Stealth 2 without lowering the
level of your stealth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Skirmisher<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Martial Prowess<br>
You're adept at turning a fight into a one-man training montage with
your enemy being a rag doll disoriented by every blow.&nbsp; You
have no need for weapons:&nbsp; You are the weapon.<br>
<br>
Your Combos are not broken from attacking a new target, or from taking
damage from an attack made by someone other than your initial
target.&nbsp; You gain a +3 bonus to Counter Combo opposed rolls,
and your Combos inflict a (Combo Counter -2) Stun, which is doubled
when using a Finisher. Additionally, your combos are not broken by a
Stun of a severity less than (Combo Counter +2).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Bruiser<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Nimble Hands<br>
You have always been able to pick things up, spin them between your
fingers, throw things just right, and otherwise use your hands well.
You may throw up to DEX/8 weapons with a multi-throw, reduce Seal
Speeds&nbsp; and the Speed of ranged attacks by 2, and may draw
weapons without any sort of action. You may sheathe weapons as a Speed
0 action.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Ranged Specialist, Single-Handed
Seals<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Restrained<br>
You know just how much force you're applying, and how to, when
necessary, apply less. This is good when doing handiwork, but also when
fighting someone who you don't want to kill or maim.<br>
<br>
Any time you inflict damage, after determining what the wound would be
you may activate this unique. The attack's damage is reduced by 25%,
and the wound it inflicted (based on its original damage) is reduced by
one category. When you use this to lower the severity of a wound you
get a +1 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls for the rest of
the battle, to a maximum of +5.<br>
<br>
Preventing a wound this way will not stop it from ending any Genjutsu
the victim was suffering from.<br>
<br>
When an attack you make would prove lethal, you may instead hold back
at the last moment. This leaves your victim at 0 HP (or, if they were
below 0 HP, they aren't reduced any further), raises the severity of
any wounds you inflicted by 1 (and cannot be combined with a normal
activation of this unique), but prevents your attack from being fatal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Avenger, Protector<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Seal Master<br>
You're really, really good with handseals. You make them fast, and mold
your chakra just as rapidly. It could be natural talent... but,
honestly, you know what it probably was? Probably when you were a kid
you were incredibly obsessed with being a super-cool ninja, so you
spent all your free time making fake handseals and pretending to shoot
fireballs at your friends. Anyway, you reduce Seal Speeds by Dex/8
(instead of Dex/10), and any jutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has
a 10% bonus to its damage.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Jutsu Master, Single-Handed Seals<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Weapon Master<br>
You know your weapons.&nbsp; You know how to use them, and how to
change them to suit your style. Your Weapon Focus ability applies to
all weapons, only needing to be taken once, and it only increases
Stamina costs by 2 per rank. Additionally, that ability's limit is
changed to (DEX -30)/20, maximum 4. If you take this after creation,
you may refund your extra Weapon Focus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Ranged Specialist<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Weight Trainer<br>
You strap yourself down with weights--either from tailoring your
clothes that way, or from strapping weights to your limbs--and hamper
yourself constantly. All in the name of one. Perfect. Fight.<br>
<br>
Once per two months you can remove the weights as Speed 10 to have your
STR, DEX, and AGI improve to 120% of their regular values, for that
fight only. These attribute adjustments do not raise your Vitality or
HP.<br>
<br>
Due to your hard training your maximum and current Athletics ranks are
increased by 2.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
##### 2 Point Uniques<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Applied Knowledge<br>
Where others use talent, you rely on practical application of your
(probably vast) knowledge to guide you. It's all well and good for
someone to be able to spot the vague outline of a hidden opponent; you,
on the other hand, notice the way the bush they're hiding behind has
been shifted, as that plant only grows facing west.<br>
<br>
You're probably kind of a nerd, to be honest. You add one third of your
Research skill rank as a bonus to all your non-Research skill rolls.
Ranks in all your skills other than Research are considered to be
(Research ranks)/4 higher for the purpose of learning Abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Avenger<br>
Someone wronged you, or someone you cared about, in a way which you
cannot forgive. You have an unremitting hatred for them, and you
channel an unhealthy amount of your free time, thoughts, and energy
into finding them and doing whatever you can to make them suffer.<br>
<br>
When you take this unique, choose the group it applies to, up to the
size of a hidden village. You get +2 to Accuracy and d20 rolls against
that group. If the group is only the size of a single clan, the bonuses
raises to +3. Against a group of 10 or fewer individuals (who can still
be grouped together under a single category, not just ten different
people named off individually), it becomes +5. And, against a single
person, you have +5 Accuracy and d20 rolls, with an additional +1 for
every thousand exp they are above you. You can choose to go into
UP-debt to take this unique, though this requires GM approval.<br>
<br>
Independent of all the above, you also receive the benefits of the
1-point unique Killing Intent--you've been driven to darkness, and it
shows in more than just your desire for vengeance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Any 1-Point Unique<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Boundless Chakra<br>
You have near-limitless reserves of chakra. Things that should tire
people out simply don't have that effect on you. You have a +3 bonus to
your Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and whenever you acquire a Chakra
Exhaustion penalty from using a jutsu, that penalty is reduced by 1.
Whenever you rest, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is lowered by the
same amount as your Stamina penalty. The Upkeeps of all your jutsu are
reduced by 1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Expansive Chakra<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Regenerative Chakra<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruiser<br>
You hit harder than you have any business doing. You may not be bulky
and muscular, but you know how to use your weight and momentum. You add
RES/40 to your physical damage bonus (to one decimal point, as usual),
and STR/20 to all grapple rolls. You reduce any damage you take by
STR/10. <br>
<br>
Your Combos are not broken from attacking a new target, or from taking
damage from an attack made by someone other than your initial
target.&nbsp; You gain a +3 bonus to Counter Combo opposed rolls,
and your Combos inflict a (Combo Counter -2) Stun, which is doubled
when using a Finisher. Additionally, your combos are not broken by a
Stun of a severity less than (Combo Counter +2).<br>
<br>
You cannot have this unique as well as Martial Prowess.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Martial Prowess<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Chakra Sensitive<br>
You have an almost subconscious ability to detect disturbances in the
For--chakra. Disturbances in chakra. It's not particularly refined, and
it may never be, but it's still a valuable talent among shinobi.<br>
<br>
Your sense range is CHA*2. Any time someone within your sense range
advances a Fatigue level due to failing a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you
know their location and current (after the roll) Fatigue level. If they
were hiding from you, this means you now know their location.<br>
<br>
In combat, this may be used any time someone makes a Chakra Exhaustion
roll, even if they succeed. In this case, roll your Chakra Control
against theirs; if you succeed, you know their location.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Chakra Sensor<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Determined<br>
You are actually good at something--you just haven't figured out what
yet. Some day you'll figure out where your natural talent lies, or
everything will just suddenly 'click' for you, and you'll go from
underdog to legendary ninja in the making, proving to everyone how
great you are.<br>
<br>
That's what you keep telling yourself, anyway. It gets a little bit
harder to believe that every day, but you didn't get where you are by
giving up just because you're no good at whatever it is you keep
failing to do. Whenever your Fatigue level increases from failing a CE
or Stamina roll, you gain 1 temporary Willpower, which is lost (if you
haven't spent it yet) the next time your Fatigue increases.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Hidden Potential<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Any 3-point unique.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Elementalist<br>
Most shinobi have a difficult time mastering the usage of elemental
chakra. You do not. It comes naturally to you, and even exceeds the
limits of most people's physical capabilities. You are able to use two
elements of your choice as if you had the Elemental Aptitude ability
for them, though this does not actually count as ranks in that ability.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Elementally Gifted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades Into: Elemental Mastery<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Endless Energy<br>
You don't get tired. It's just not something you do. Whenever your
Stamina penalty increases, it increases by 1 less. The first time in a
battle you fail a Stamina roll, you advance one less Fatigue category.
You enjoy a +(RES)/40 bonus to all your Stamina rolls. Every 15 IC,
your Stamina penalty decreases by 1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Indefatigable<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Exceptionally Fast<br>
You take speed to a new level. You outrun the wind, your allies, and
yes, even the bear chasing you. Everything you do is almost too fast
for the eye to follow. The base Speed of all your actions is reduced by
10%; this reduction is actually rounded up, meaning that a Speed 11
technique would be reduced by (11*0.1 = 1.1 -&amp;gt; 2) 2, to
Speed 9. Even so, it cannot be used to reduce an action to Speed 0. As
long as you partially succeed in a Dodge, you take no secondary effects
from the attack (such as status conditions, penalties, or wounds) and
when you dodge successfully you may move as many yards as if you'd
taken a Speed 5 Move action. When you move towards an enemy as part of
an attack, you may move up to that action's full Speed worth, rather
than half.<br>
<br>
You cannot have this unique as well as Blur.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Blur<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Jutsu Master<br>
You have a knack for mastering new jutsu, and, more impressively, not
confusing them with one another no matter how many you seem to learn.
The cost to learn non-clan jutsu is halved, before any other
reductions. This is, in fact, retroactive! You reduce Seal Speeds by
Dex/8 (instead of Dex/10), do 5% more damage with all your jutsu (not
just ninjutsu), and any ninjutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has
an additional 5% damage.<br>
<br>
You cannot have this unique as well as Seal Master.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Seal Master<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Protector<br>
Your friends are your life and you will make sure no harm comes to
them. Becoming either a wall in between them and your enemies, or an
unstoppable force that ravages the oncomers, you will always do your
best to get everyone else out safely. You add your RES one more time to
your Vitality and HP.<br>
<br>
You have a secondary pool of Vitality, equal to half your normal
maximum, that cannot be wounded and is damaged only when Taking the Hit
for someone else.<br>
<br>
Your Take the Hit action has a +5 bonus, and when you successfully take
the hit you may automatically block. It automatically succeeds under
any of the following conditions: you and your allies are outnumbered;
the total XP of you and your allies is less than 75% the total XP of
your enemies; you are protecting someone who has run out of Vitality;
you are protecting someone of lower rank; or you are protecting
somebody with 75% or less of your total XP.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Close Ties, Restrained<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Ranged Specialist<br>
You prefer to keep your distance in combat, without resorting to
powerful ninjutsu. Rather, you favor the basics: projectile weaponry!
You may throw up to DEX/8 weapons with a multi-throw, reduce Seal
Speeds and the Speed of ranged attacks by 4, and may draw weapons
without any sort of action. You may sheathe weapons as a Speed 0 action.<br>
<br>
As a Speed 4 Interrupt you may perform a ranged parry with a +4 bonus
against any thrown weapon attack (including those caused or improved by
jutsu). The exact weapons used don't matter, but you must throw as many
weapons in this parry as your opponent did in their attack. <br>
<br>
You cannot have this unique as well as Nimble Hands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Nimble Hands<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Single-Handed Seals<br>
Be it rigorous training or just excess talent, you've mastered one of
the most exceptionally rare talents among shinobi: being able to
perform handseals with only a single hand. You reduce Seal Speeds by
Dex/7 (instead of Dex/10), and any jutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to
0 has a 10% bonus to its damage. Your maximum and current Chakra
Control ranks are increased by 2, and you reduce the Seal Speed of any
ninjutsu by an additional Chakra Control/10 while using both hands.<br>
<br>
You cannot have this unique as well as Seal Master.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Seal Master<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Skirmisher<br>
You prefer a very specific style of fighting: engage your opponent,
seize the advantage while they're confused, then fall back and
disengage. While they're trying to recover, prepare yourself to repeat
that again, and do so until your enemies are too demoralized or badly
beaten to fight back. You have a +3 bonus to Stealth rolls, and the
speed of your Hide action is reduced by 3. You can move when in Stealth
2 without lowering the level of your stealth and when making attacks
while in Stealth 2 your damage bonus is increased by DEX/30, or DEX/20
if you break stealth to do so. Your limit for Stealth skill ranks is
increased by 3, and you can hide so long as your opponents have a
visibility penalty of -4 or worse.<br>
<br>
You cannot have this unique as well as Lightfoot.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Lightfoot<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenacious<br>
You have learned to delve into the minds of your opponents, figured out
the way they tick, and keep a constant control over their mind. Keeping
enemies mesmerized is a simple feat for you. You have a +3 bonus to
Genjutsu rolls, your maximum and current Research ranks are increased
by 2, and -3 to the Speed of all your genjutsu. Opponents must
successfully use Genjutsu Kai twice to break free from your illusions;
they do realize this after the first success. Skill focus's scale is
now once every third rank (Ranks 1, 2, and 3 cost 2 SP; ranks 4, 5, and
6 cost 3 SP; and so forth).<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
##### 3 Point Uniques<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Chakra Sensor<br>
You possess the coveted ability to sense the chakra in living things.
Unlike being merely sensitive to chakra, you can tell people apart by
their chakra alone.<br>
<br>
Your sense range is CHA*5. Whenever someone within your sense range
advances a Fatigue level due to failing a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you
know their location and can identify their chakra signature, as well as
their current Fatigue level. In combat, this effect takes places
whenever they make a Chakra Exhaustion roll.<br>
<br>
You can also tell any general traits of their chakra
(&amp;quot;oppressive&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;weak&amp;quot;, etc.), if they're fallen into HP, and
what their Elemental Affinity is (only if they have ranks in the
ability). If you detect somebody who's in Stealth, you know their
location (i.e. they are no longer hidden from you, just as if you'd
found them normally). Your maximum Chakra Control ranks are increased
by 3 and you have a +3 bonus to your defensive Genjutsu rolls.<br>
<br>
You can also use the following action:<br>
<br>
Scan (Speed 10)<br>
In combat, make an opposed Chakra Control roll against anyone (or
everyone) present; people may allow themselves to fail this roll rather
than bothering with it. People being scanned have a penalty to their
Chakra Control roll equal to the total Upkeep penalty of any jutsu
they're maintaining. If you succeed, you detect them as described
above. Out of combat, if someone passes a roll against your Scan they
will automatically pass all other rolls against it made within the next
half hour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Chakra Sensitive<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Elemental Mastery<br>
You have peerless control over elemental chakra, far beyond the realm
of what's considered normal, and to a level that some would even think
is impossible. Choose two elements; you can use them as if you had
taken the Elemental Aptitude ability for them. Additionally, your ranks
in the Elemental Affinity ability apply to all elements you can use.
This doesn't mean your personal chakra nature corresponds to all five
elements, only that you're equally skilled with them all.<br>
<br>
Each rank of Elemental Affinity also gives you a +0.5 bonus to your
ninjutsu damage bonus with elemental ninjutsu. Additionally, all your
offensive elemental ninjutsu receive a bonus depending upon what
element your last offensive elemental ninjutsu technique was, and what
rank it was. This only works if the jutsu you are using is of a
different element than the previous one (using two Raiton in a row will
provide no bonus; if you then switch to a Katon, that Katon would
receive the Lightning bonus listed below).<br>
<br>
Earth: Stun of 2 * (rank)<br>
Fire: Burns of 2* (rank)<br>
Lightning: Paralysis of 1 per rank above E (1 for D, 2 for C, etc.),
for 5 * (severity + 1) IC.<br>
Water: -2 Chakra cost per rank<br>
Wind: Blocking's effect is reduced by 5% per rank.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Elementalist<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Regenerative Chakra<br>
You have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of chakra. You might push
yourself to your limit, but within minutes your chakra reserves will
have replenished themselves. During combat in particular, it's
noticeable that your energy seems to have no limit.<br>
<br>
You have a +5 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls. Whenever you spend a
point of Willpower, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is reset to 0; you
can also choose to spend a point of Willpower specifically for this
purpose immediately before making a Chakra Exhaustion roll.<br>
<br>
When using one or more techniques with an Upkeep, the total Upkeep is
reduced by 1+CHA/30, to a minimum of half its normal value.
Additionally, once per battle you may fail a Chakra Exhaustion check
and advance one less Fatigue level (though your penalties do not reset).<br>
<br>
You have (your max Willpower) chakra points each battle. You may spend
these to improve the result of a Chakra Exhaustion roll on a 1:1 basis
after seeing the result. As you are worn down progressively, your body
tries to compensate by producing even more chakra. As a result, your
ninjutsu damage bonus is increased by your Fatigue level.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Boundless Chakra<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Relentless<br>
You don't stop, you don't quit, and you absolutely don't give up. Those
would be great, admirable traits, except for you it only really applies
when it comes to brutalizing other human beings.<br>
<br>
Every time you hit someone with a taijutsu attack, you get a +1 bonus
to your physical damage bonus, up to a maximum of half its normal
value. This bonus resets when you miss, change targets, or use a
non-taijutsu attack. Hyuuga using Jyuuken instead receive this bonus to
their ninjutsu damage bonus. All your unarmed attacks gain Stun 2, or
increase their existing Stun by 1.<br>
<br>
When you miss within any taijutsu attack your next action comes sooner,
as if the Speed of the action you used was half its actual value. For
example, if you missed with a Speed 13 action on IC 30, your next
action would come on IC 37, rather than IC 43. Every time you miss,
your next action gets a cumulative +1 Accuracy as long as it's a
taijutsu attack, to a maximum of +3; hitting someone, or taking a
different kind of action, resets this bonus.<br>

###&nbsp;&nbsp; Super Novice<br>
You're still not good at anything in particular. Everything for you is
two steps forwards and one step back. Even if you thought you found
your niche, it turns out that no, you really didn't. But you're tired
of letting that get in your way! Now, you're going to just do what you
want, your way! Yeah! That'll show 'em!<br>
<br>
You have a 10% XP bonus. When you're Wounded, you get a temporary 1
point of Willpower. This lasts until the next time you're Wounded; if
you haven't spent it by then, it's replaced. If you have, you get a new
one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrades From: Any 1- or 2-point unique,
except Elementally Gifted or Elementalist<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; Surging Power<br>
You have a dauntless ability to keep fighting, no matter what the
situation. Even when you should be sprawled in the dirt unable to move
a single muscle, somehow you stand back up and keep fighting.<br>
<br>
You can spend Willpower to reroll your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion
rolls (with all the normal rules, and benefits, for spending Willpower
on a roll). Additionally, you can spend a point of Willpower to ignore
all effects of a single woudn you're suffering from for the remainder
of the battle.<br>
<br>
Finally, you reduce the penalties to Accuracy and defensive rolls by
your current Willpower. So, at 3 Fatigue with 4 Willpower remaining you
would go from -3 Accuracy and -6 defensive rolls to no Accuracy penalty
and -2 defensive rolls.<br>

###&nbsp;&nbsp; Tactician<br>
Beyond raw strength or the biggest fireballs, you focus on a different
aspect of combat: strategy. Through clever decoys, exploiting
weaknesses, and striking at blindspots, you can take down superior foes.<br>
<br>
The first time you use any action in combat, it gains +2 Accuracy or to
its relevant d20 roll (such as a dodge). If you hit with an attack that
receives that bonus, you immediately gain (that action's Speed)/2 AP
(though this won't take you over your maximum).<br>
<br>
You may spend 10 AP to replace an action's Accuracy (or convert its
existing accuracy roll) into an accuracy roll using 2d20.takeHighest(1)
in place of 1d20.<br>
<br>
You can shout advice or instructions, or just pointers about your
enemies and the battlefield, to allies, to give them an edge. As a
Speed 0 action, you can switch your current place in the initiative
order with a willing ally's, allowing them to act immediately and
delaying your next action to the previous location of theirs. This
costs 2 AP per IC away their action is, and may not be used on a
stunned ally. You may spend 1 Willpower to lower the cost to 1 AP per
IC for one use.<br>

#&nbsp;&nbsp; Combat<br>
Combat... happens. Realistically, it's something ninja know how to do,
and as they get more experience it becomes something they're able to do
very well. Accordingly, there are rules for combat, which you use when
trying to beat other people into submission, or prevent them from doing
the same to you.<br>
<br>
The combat chapter has 7 sections of varying importance, which are...!<br>
<br>
<br>
## &amp;lt; Initiative &amp;gt;<br>
A brief explanation of the core of Naruto World's combat system. It
explains the broad concepts of how time, turn order, and actions are
handled. A short but important read! Pretty much nothing else in the
chapter will make sense without this.<br>
<br>
## &amp;lt; Actions &amp;gt;<br>
Coming in right behind 'Initiative' in terms of importance, here is
where you'll find all the basic actions which everyone can perform,
along with rules on how to attack and your bread-and-butter defenses.
Other attractions include a crash course in how to use ninjutsu and
genjutsu, and rules for spending Willpower (you remember Willpower,
right? one of your derived Attributes?).<br>
<br>
## &amp;lt; Stealth &amp;gt;<br>
How to hide, how to find people who are hiding, and what you can do
while hidden. You should probably be at least familiar with this before
you start playing, but you can safely ignore it your first time through
the chapter.<br>
<br>
## &amp;lt; Status and Conditions &amp;gt;<br>
You may want to skim this section, but it's not vital. You should have
read the Conditions part at least once before you get into combat, and
you can basically ignore Statuses until they actually come up during
battle; same for effects.<br>
<br>
## &amp;lt; Fatigue &amp;gt;<br>
This is important; Fatigue is one of the key elements of combat, as
it's what regulates how frequently you can use your powerful jutsu
before being worn out. You should probably read it right after
Initiative, or perhaps Actions. Definitely more important than Stealth
or Status/Conditions.<br>
<br>
## &amp;lt; Wounds &amp;gt;<br>
You should read the Explanation node before you get into combat. The
rest you can safely ignore until you actually have to deal with the
effects, either due to inflicting them on others, or suffering from
them yourself.<br>
<br>
## &amp;lt; Recovery &amp;gt;<br>
While it wouldn't hurt to at least peruse the node (though the
'Guidelines' section can be ignored unless those topics actually come
up), you can basically ignore this entirely until the aftermath of your
first battle.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>

#&nbsp; Initiative<br>
&nbsp;&gt;1. Initiative Roll<br>
&nbsp;&gt;2. Flow of Time<br>
&nbsp;&gt;3. Simultaneous Actions<br>
&nbsp;&gt;4. Action Points<br>
&nbsp;&gt;5. Example<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Initiative Roll<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Combat begins with all participants making an Initiative roll:
1d20+(AGI)/10. From there, everyone is assigned a number depending upon
how well they did compared to one another.<br>
<br>
Everyone subtracts their roll from the person who rolled the highest;
this is the initiative count they will act on.<br>
<br>
For example, Choji, Shikamaru, and Ino are all preparing to fight, and
so they roll initiative. Choji scores an 6, Shikamaru a 16, and Ino a
12. They will act on the following initiative counts:<br>
Choji: 16 - 6 = 10<br>
Shikamaru: 16 - 16 = 0<br>
Ino: 16 - 12 = 4<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Flow of Time<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Combat begins on Initiative Count 0, or &amp;quot;Init
0&amp;quot;, or simply &amp;quot;IC 0&amp;quot;. Players
act whenever their initiative count is reached.<br>
<br>
Every action a player can take has a given Speed associated with it.
When they take an action, its effects are resolved immediately, and its
speed is added to their current initiative count; that is when they
will be able to act again.<br>
<br>
For example, if you use a Speed 6 action on IC 5, your action will be
resolved then and there. After it finishes, combat will progress to IC
6, other people will take their turns, and so on, until IC (5+6 =) 11
is reached, when you will be able to act again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some effects may lower an action's speed. No matter how many such
effects are applied, no action's speed may ever go below half its
original value, rounded up, and no action's Speed can be reduced below
3. This does mean that an action with a base Speed of 3 or lower may
not have its Speed decreased at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Simultaneous Actions<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
If two people act on the same initiative count, both of their actions
are declared and resolved simultaneously. Thus, you and your opponent
will both fully declare and resolve your attacks (you can take turns
doing so, for the sake of convenience), but not apply their effects
until after you've both done so, at the very end of the IC.<br>
<br>
Blocking is a partial exception. If you were blocking when your turn
came up, and you choose to block against, it takes priority; that is to
say, you may use Block as a defense against an attack delivered on the
same IC, under those circumstances.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Action Points<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
One of the things that makes battles dramatic is one or both sides
pulling out sudden, unpredicted surprises, and among shinobi that's par
for the course. Mechanically, this is represented by
&amp;quot;Action Points&amp;quot;; thematically this can be a
burst of adrenaline, or the result of you carefully luring your
opponent into just the right position for you to counter-attack.<br>
<br>
You gain 5 AP every time the Initiative Count reaches a multiple of 20.
You start the battle with zero, and can have up to a maximum of AGI/2.<br>
<br>
You can spend AP whenever you take an action. Each AP spent reduces the
action's Speed by 1.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Example<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
It may help if you read the Actions section of this chapter before
reading this example.<br>
<br>
Using the example above, we had Shikamaru acting on IC 0, Ino on 4, and
Choji on 10. Shikamaru spends his first action attacking Choji with a
Speed 8 punch, meaning he'll act next on IC 8.<br>
<br>
To defend himself, Choji tries to dodge, though fails to do so. He's
hit, and takes damage, but dodging pushed his next action back by 2,
putting his next action on 12.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ino goes next, and begins forming handseals for a potent ninjutsu
technique. It has a Seal Speed of 14, meaning she'll be ready to act on
IC (4 + 14 =) 18.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shikamaru goes again, and uses a simple taijutsu technique with a speed
of 12. Choji tries to dodge again, this time evading successfully.
Shikamaru's next action will be on IC 20 (8+12), and Choji's on IC 14
(12+2, because he dodged).<br>
<br>
<br>
Choji's taking a bit of a beating, but Shikamaru's not hitting hard.
He's worried about what Ino might be planning, though (she only had to
declare that she was using a Perform Handseals action, not what jutsu
it was for), so he disengages and rushes his other teammate, unleashing
a powerful taijutsu technique with a speed of 20. Not wanting to take
that kind of hit, Ino tries to dodge, and fails.<br>
<br>
Ino has to make a Chakra Control skill check, against the damage of
Choji's attack divided by 10. She rolls very well, and manages to
succeed; had she failed, she would've automatically aborted her
handseals action, meaning her next action would be on IC 15 (the attack
happened on IC 14, +1 = 15), and if she wanted to use that technique
she'd need to start over.<br>
<br>
\page <br>
<br>
Choji's next action won't come until IC 34 (14+20), whereas Ino's jutsu
has been delayed until IC 20 (18+2).<br>
<br>
<br>
IC 20 comes up, and Shikamaru and Ino are both ready to go. It's too
late for Shikamaru to do anything about Ino's jutsu; she's already
completed the handseals, and this turn she'll be able to use it. Worse
yet, he doesn't know if she'll be targeting him or Choji.<br>
<br>
If he'd had a little more time--for example, if he'd used a quicker
move in place of the taijutsu technique he utilized last--he could
declare a Block of a speed that would expire some time after Ino's
action, allowing him to reliably defend himself if she chose to target
him.<br>
<br>
That's not an option, so he goes for a quick punch at her (not wanting
to make the same mistake as last time, that'll give him plenty of
opportunity to prepare before Choji's next action). Ino uses her
technique, a Speed 6 ninjutsu. Both try to dodge the other's technique.<br>
<br>
This means that Shikamaru will act on IC (20+8+2) 30, Ino on (20+6+2)
28, and Choji on 34.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

<br>
====================<br>
1. Basic Actions<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
These are actions that anyone can do in combat, and the rules
associated with them.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Basic Attack,
Unarmed (Speed 8, Stamina 5)<br>
The simplest form of attack, this is a catch all for punches, kicks,
headbutts, and any other attack which uses your body to cause harm to
your enemy's. This deals 2d4 damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Basic Attack,
Weapon (Speed Variable)<br>
This is any ordinary attack with a weapon, from throwing shuriken to
swinging oversized swords. The speed is listed with the individual
weapon, as is the base damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Block (Speed
Variable)<br>
As an action, you may declare that you are blocking, and state a Speed
for the action. Until your next action, you may use the Block defense
(see 'Defending' below) against any incoming attacks.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Rest (Speed 5)<br>
Resting is pausing to cool down and gather your breath. Since it
doesn't directly lead to incapacitating your enemy, most ninja prefer
to do this out of battle; however, sometimes pacing yourself is the
only way to achieve victory. Every Rest action you take reduces your
Stamina penalty (see the 'Fatigue' portion of this chapter) by 1, to a
minimum of 0.<br>
<br>
You cannot reduce the speed of your Rest action; 'resting as fast as
you can' is, after all, something of an oxymoron.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp; Perform
Handseals (Speed Variable, Abort)<br>
Most ninjutsu and genjutsu technique require the use of handseals,
specialized hand signs that direct and mold the flow of chakra.
Representing this, those jutsu have a Seal Speed listed in their
description. That number, minus your DEX/10, gives you the modified
seal speed, which is the Speed of your Perform Handseals action.
However, other Speed-reducing effects do not apply to Perform
Handseals. A Seal Speed of 0 means that while handseals are required,
you can perform them so fast that the time required is negligible.<br>
<br>
Perform Handseals actions are necessary to perform most Ninjutsu and
Genjutsu (see below). You may forego part, or all, of your DEX/10
reduction of Seal Speed if you wish (for example, with 40 DEX you could
use Perform Handseals action for a seal speed 10 jutsu at anywhere
between Speed 6 and Speed 10, as you pleased).<br>
<br>
Handseals require the use of both hands, and if they're interrupted for
any reason you have to start over again. Although you don't have to
declare what technique you're performing the handseals for when you
start, all techniques have their own, unique combination of seals to
perform them; this means that if you changed your mind partway through
a Perform Handseals action, you'd need to start a new one.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp; Move (Speed
Variable)<br>
For the most part, ninja can move faster than ordinary people. When you
actually devote time to moving in battle, you travel (AGI)*(number of
IC spent moving)/50 yards.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you may need to close the distance and attack an opponent all
at once. When attacking, you may move towards your opponent a distance
corresponding to half your attack's Speed, for free. Thus, if you
needed to rush an enemy and throw a punch at them, and had 25 AGI, as a
Speed 8 action you could move up to (25*(8/2)/50 =) 2 yards and then
use a basic unarmed attack.<br>
<br>
Movement is unique, in that you cannot use Action Points to reduce its
Speed. Your distance traveled is determined by the actual number of IC
spent on movement.<br>
<br>
\page <br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp; Interrupt
(Speed N/A)<br>
Being able to interrupt is a special quality certain abilities and
techniques have, which allows them to be performed in response to
another action, generally an attack directed at the user; for example,
most defensive jutsu have this quality.<br>
<br>
You may use an interrupt if the Speed of the interrupt (and in the case
of ninjutsu, Speed + modified Seal Speed) is half or less that of the
action you're interrupting. This is one instance where you may use a
ninjutsu with handseals without having performed the handseals as a
prior action. The Speed (not, in the case of ninjutsu, counting Seal
Speed) of the interrupt is added to your next action on the IC.<br>
<br>
Actions used as Interrupts with base Speeds of 3 or below may still be
reduced to half (rounded up) of their base speed (normally, an action
with a base Speed of 3 or lower cannot have its Speed reduced further).<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Ninjutsu and Genjutsu<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Performing<br>
The majority of ninjutsu and genjutsu techniques have an entry for Seal
Speed in their description. Those that don't, and those with a Seal
Speed of 0, can be used at will, like regular actions.<br>
<br>
For the rest, however, they may not be used unless preceded by a
Perform Handseals action (see above). The jutsu you're using must be
used on your next action, at which point its effects are resolved and
you, as normal, will determine your next action based on the jutsu's
speed.<br>
<br>
If you take damage while forming handseals (between the declaration of
your Perform Handseals action and when you actually use the jutsu), you
must exceed 10 + (damage dealt / 10) on a Chakra Control skill roll in
order to continue. Failure means you automatically Abort your Perform
Handseals action.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Genjutsu<br>
Genjutsu are the mind-affecting, often-illusionary techniques used by
ninja. While they can be potent in some situations, they're difficult
to use against experienced ninja. Attempting to influence someone with
Genjutsu (whether directly, such as a mental attack, or indirectly,
casting an illusion over an area and determining if it fools them) is
resolved through a set of opposed Genjutsu rolls.<br>
<br>
The 'attacker' rolls 1d20+XP/400, and the 'defender' rolls 1d20+XP/200,
both adding any bonuses to genjutsu. Some bonuses may apply only to
offensive or defensive genjutsu rolls. In these cases, the person using
the genjutsu is the 'attacker', and the person trying to avoid being
affected is the 'defender'. If the defender rolls lower than their
opponent, they suffer the effects of the technique being used.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attacking<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The simplest and most effective way to resolve a conflict is often
violence. In some cases, it's the only way. Thus, it behooves any
shinobi to be able to, when necessary, incapacitate or kill an opponent.<br>
<br>
The first step of attacking is to declare what your attack will be, its
speed, and its accuracy, so that the other player knows what defenses
they can use against it.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Accuracy<br>
Accuracy is a measurement of how precise your attacks are, represented
by a target number (TN) your opponent has to match or beat on their
defense roll. Your attack's Accuracy is 10+(DEX)/10, plus any bonuses
you may get from abilities, uniques, or the technique you're using.<br>
<br>
After you've declared your attack, your opponent will declare and (if
applicable) roll their defense. If you hit them successfully, you'll
then roll damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Accuracy Rolls<br>
Sometimes you'll have to make an &amp;quot;accuracy
roll&amp;quot;. This is essentially the same as your accuracy, but
you replace the base 10 with a 1d20 roll. In other words, it's
1d20+(DEX/10) plus any other Accuracy abilities. When something
penalizes both Accuracy and d20 rolls, apply only the penalties to
Accuracy; if it penalizes only d20 rolls, however, then those penalties
also apply.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Damage<br>
Every attack has a &amp;quot;base damage&amp;quot;, a number of
dice of a certain size you roll. For example, a basic unarmed attack
does 2d4 of base damage. The actual damage formula is,<br>
(Base Damage) + (Damage Bonus) * (Speed) + (any other bonuses)<br>
<br>
Your damage bonus is the value determined by your STR (for most
attacks) or CHA (for ninjutsu). The damage bonus is multiplied by speed
to represent that slower, more solid attacks are able to better benefit
from your raw power. Some abilities may add bonus damage, but unless
they explicitly say so, this does not affect your stat-based
&amp;quot;Damage Bonus.&amp;quot;<br>
<br>
Damage is done to an opponent's Vitality unless stated otherwise, until
that reaches 0. Any overflow, and all future damage, goes straight to
their Hit Points.<br>
<br>
Unless otherwise noted, any alterations of an action's Speed also
affect its damage bonus; faster isn't always better.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Defense<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Inevitably, you will at some point be attacked. Accordingly, ninja are
trained to defend themselves in a variety of ways. Normally, you may
only use a single defense against any given attack.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Dodge (Speed
2, Interrupt)<br>
The best defense against any attack is simply not being hit. When you
dodge an attack you roll 1d20+(AGI)/10, plus any other bonuses to dodge
you may have, such as from abilities or uniques, against the attack's
Accuracy. Success means you completely avoid the attack and its effects.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Parry (Speed
3, Interrupt)<br>
This entails deflecting an opponent's weapon with your own, or stopping
their unarmed attacks with your bare hands. Accordingly, weapon attacks
may only be parried with weapons, and unarmed attacks may only be
parried if you have at least one hand free to do so. Parrying works
similarly to dodging, though uses an Accuracy roll to determine its
success.<br>
<br>
When something (such as Fatigue) penalizes both Accuracy and defensive
rolls (or rolls in general), Parry only suffers the penalty to
defensive rolls; if something penalizes only Accuracy, then Parry does
suffer that penalty. Basically, it doesn't have to deal with 'double
jeopardy'.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Block<br>
Blocking is bracing yourself for an attack as effectively as possible,
and being on guard to do so at a moment's notice. Blocking is special
in that you cannot choose to block at a moment's notice. However, if
your last action was to begin blocking (see 'Block' in actions, above),
you may automatically block any attack made against you. This is an
option; you could still choose to dodge instead, if you desired, and
then block the next attack that came your way.<br>
<br>
Blocking reduced the damage of unarmed and ninjutsu attacks by 50%.
However, weapon damage is only reduced by 25%; while it's all well and
good to keep a punch away from your vitals, a sword cut is nasty
business no matter where it lands.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Jutsu<br>
Some taijutsu and ninjutsu techniques may provide special defensive
options. Most of these are Interrupts, but the rules for exactly how
they work will be listed within the description of the actual
techniques.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp; Partial Success<br>
Just because you failed to evade a shuriken or deflect a sword slash
doesn't mean they struck a vital area. When you make a defensive roll
to avoid an attack, for each point you fail by you take 20% damage. Any
status effects that are part of the technique, however, will apply
normally.<br>
<br>
That can be confusing, so, it's example time! So you roll a 14 on your
dodge, against an Accuracy 15 attack. You failed by 1 point, so you
take 20% of the attack's normal damage. Had you rolled a 12, you would
take 60% damage. And, if you had rolled a 7 (failing by 8 points) you
would take the full, 100% damage.<br>
<br>
With regards to defensive jutsu: Partial success typically applies to
any jutsu which works similar to a dodge or parry. That is, you make a
d20 roll, and if successful the attack you are defending against does
not hit you. However, if the technique has another effect (such as make
a d20 roll, and if you succeed you reduce the attack's damage by a set
amount), partial success does not apply. Exceptions to this will be
noted otherwise in the individual technique's description.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Damage Reduction<br>
Some effects, such as uniques and clan abilities, provide damage
reduction (DR). This reduces incoming damage directly: if you have 10
DR, and an attack does 100 damage, you would only take 90 damage from
it.<br>
<br>
Damage reduction is applied before blocking or partial defense.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Willpower<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ninja are capable of incredible feats, and some are truly exceptional,
performing astonishing deeds in the face of adversity. While you can be
as determined (or not) as you please, Willpower represents your ability
to use that determination to push yourself above and beyond your limits.<br>
<br>
You can spend Willpower any time you attack, or make a d20 roll, after
you've seen the action's normal results. When you spend a point of
Willpower, reroll whichever roll it was used on (or, in the case of an
attack, make an Accuracy Roll). If the d20 result is less than 11, add
10 to it; this is your new result for that action.<br>
<br>
Willpower may not, however, be used to reroll Stamina or Chakra
Exhaustion rolls.<br>
<br>
You may also choose to spend Willpower after someone else has done so
to alter the result of their action. However, any given roll or attack
may only have Willpower applied to it one time.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;3. Action Chains<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Advanced Actions<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Take The Hit (Speed 6,
Interrupt)<br>
Taking the hit is the glorious move the stronger person or sensei uses
to protect their weaker ally! You make a dodge roll with a +5 bonus; if
successful, you've leapt in the way of an attack aimed at your ally. If
you fail, your ally takes 20% of the damage per point you failed by.
(For example: If you fail by 2 points, you'd take 60% damage, and your
ally 40% damage).<br>
<br>
If you were blocking when you used this, you make block as long as you
were successful by 1 point or more. You may also use interrupts to
defend yourself, up to a maximum Speed of how many points your Take The
Hit roll beat the opponent's accuracy; you can't dodge, but you could
parry, or use a ninjutsu-based defense that raises a protective wall.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Delay (Speed
N/A)<br>
Delay is not, properly speaking, an action in and of itself, but rather
a quality certain actions have. For an example of how this might be
written, an attack could have &amp;quot;Speed 12, Delay
4&amp;quot;. This means that while it would be declared normally on
your turn, its effects would take place 4 initiative counts later. The
action may be aborted any time up to the last IC of the delay.<br>
<br>
For example, using the above attack on IC 10, you would have until IC
14 to abort; on IC 14 itself, so long as you did not abort the attack's
effects would be resolved normally, and you would then act again on IC
22. An action's Speed may not be reduced below its Delay.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Abort (Speed
1, or Speed +1)<br>
Certain actions will say they can be aborted, or just list
&amp;quot;Abort&amp;quot; as one of their qualities along with
speed (such as the Perform Handseals action). Aborting may declared on
any initiative count before your next action, allowing you to act on
the following IC. When you abort an action, you stop performing it;
exactly what this entails will usually be discussed in the individual
actions.<br>
<br>
Alternately, you may choose to Abort as part of an Interrupt--for
example, aborting handseals so you can perform a defensive ninjutsu
technique. This adds 1 to the Speed of that Interrupt.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Multi-Throwing<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Anyone familiar with fictionalized depictions of ninja has no doubt
seen them flinging a handful of shuriken with pinpoint aim. As this
game is about fictional ninjas, it stands to reason that they can do
this! The term, appropriately enough, is
&amp;quot;Multi-Throwing.&amp;quot;<br>
<br>
It helps to first be familiar with the two weapons you'll be throwing
the most: They are the shuriken (weighing in at 1d6 damage) and the
kunai (beating it out with 2d6).<br>
<br>
While you could certainly throw a single shuriken or kunai (that would
be a basic weapon attack, and full stats for doing so are listed in
those weapons' equipment entries), a real ninja would throw a bunch at
once.<br>
<br>
By default, you may only throw one type of weapon at once; you could
throw 6 shuriken, but not 4 shuriken and 2 kunai in the same action.
After choosing your weapon, you decide how many you want to throw.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the multi-throw action.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Multi-Throw
(Speed and Stamina Variable)<br>
You throw at least 2 weapons, up to a maximum of DEX/10. The Speed is 3
+ (number of weapons thrown)/2, and the Stamina cost is 5, +1 for every
2 weapons (6 for 2-3, 7 for 4-5, and so forth). Regardless of how many
weapons you throw, the minimum total Speed of a multi-throw action is
5--this applies to both its base Speed, and its final Speed after any
changes (such as spending AP).<br>
<br>
The rolled damage is the total for all weapons thrown; 6 shuriken would
roll 6d6. Your damage bonus is increased by +0.5 for every thrown
weapon. So, if you had 60 STR in the above multi-throw, your damage
bonus would be (60/15 = 4, 4 + 0.5*6 = 4+3 =) 7. The attack would be
Speed (3 + 6/2) 6 and Stamina 8, and have a damage formula of:<br>
6d6+7*6<br>
<br>
If you are multi-throwing shuriken, their +2 Accuracy is applied only
once. You do need to choose between shuriken or kunai when you
multi-throw; you can't mix-and-match, tragically.<br>
<br>
Because wounds represent severe damage from a single powerful attack,
and multi-throws are multiple weaker injuries delivered at once, the
severity of all wounds caused by multi-throws is reduced by one
category, to a minimum of Minor.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Action Chains<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Chains are a special type of action, where multiple techniques are
combined or used at once. Each chain has a single Core action, and one
or more Links. Your core action can be virtually any action in the PHB,
from dodging an attack to using a high-ranked ninjutsu. What makes an
action a Chain is, instead, its Links. Links are techniques which,
rather than being used alone (or sometimes as an alternative to that),
can be used to supplement or modify another action.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to identify a Link is that rather than its own Speed
value (like &amp;quot;Speed: 4&amp;quot;), it will say
something like &amp;quot;Speed: +4&amp;quot;. Many of these
also have Stamina or Chakra costs written as a number to be added or
subtracted. In the description of these techniques, they'll specify
what they do, and when they can be used (for example, Kawarimi is
linked to a Dodge action; and the E-rank Water-Gathering Technique can
be linked to many suiton ninjutsu).<br>
<br>
Using a chain is fairly simple. Simply sum up the Speeds and costs of
all actions involved; these are the values for the Chain, which is
treated as one single, complete action. For example, using
Water-Gathering with Water Sphere is a single action with a Chakra cost
of 10 and a Seal Speed of 8. When you apply Kawarimi to a dodge,
&amp;quot;Dodge + Kawarimi&amp;quot; is your new action, with a
base Speed of 6.<br>
<br>
Any effects which modify an action's Speed (or other variables) do so
to the Chain itself, not individual links (or the core action). In the
case of Chains where the Core action is a damage-dealing attack, this
becomes slightly more complicated. The Speed value used for your
(Speed)*(appropriate Damage Bonus) will be the lower of the Core
action's base Speed, or the Chain's final Speed (after all
modifications), whichever is lower. The rank of the Core technique
determines the rank of the chain; chains using Shuurai (a D-rank
Raiton) would always be treated as D-rank attacks, even if you added an
A-rank link to them.<br>
<br>
There is no limit to how many links a chain may have. You could, for
example, make a Chain out of Leaping Shadow Evasion (Core), Phantom
Step (Link), Water Splash (Link) and, after that failed, Kawarimi
(Link), all for a single dodge. This action would have a Chakra cost of
10 (5+5, from Kawarimi and Mizuhane), and a fairly high Stamina cost
(depending on how much effort you put into your Phantom
Step).&lt;/text&gt;<br>

<br>
====================<br>
1. Hiding<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ninja hide. It's sort of their... thing. That said, hiding can be
accomplished under one of four circumstances:<br>
<br>
1. Nobody is watching you. Well, nobody you're trying to hide from.
This automatically prevents usage in combat, though see the other two
situations.<br>
<br>
2. Everyone you are trying to hide from has a -6 or higher visibility
penalty.<br>
<br>
3. You are already hidden, and taking another Hide action in hopes of
getting a new, higher Stealth TN.<br>
<br>
4. You use a jutsu which explicitly allows you to hide as one of its
effects. Note that when you hide this way, the Hide action itself is
reduced to Speed 0.<br>
<br>
Once you meet one of those requirements, you may hide. Hiding is, of
course, an action! When hidden, you may not be targeted by enemy
attacks (because they don't know where you are!). It's possible to be
hidden from some people, but not others.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Hide (Speed 10)<br>
Make a Stealth skill roll; the result becomes your
&amp;quot;Stealth TN&amp;quot; (target number), how hard it is
to find you. You are hidden at level 1 Stealth.<br>
<br>
For every time you've hidden in a battle, your future Stealth rolls to
hide have a -5 penalty (the third time you hid yourself, you'd have a
-10 penalty; this applies even if you're hiding with jutsu or other
effects).<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Improve Hiding
(Speed 7)<br>
This action may be performed only while hiding at level 1 stealth. You
take the time to make sure you're properly hidden and settle into
place, moving you up to level 2 stealth. In case that wasn't clear,
this cannot, by itself, take you from level 2 to level 3 stealth.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Stealth Levels<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
There are three levels of stealth, corresponding to different degrees
of being hidden. Each level has limitations on what can be done on it;
for example, in Level 2 and Level 3 Stealth, you cannot move. Thus, if
you were at Stealth 3, and chose to spend an action moving, you would
immediately be dropped to Stealth 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Stealth, Level
1<br>
Stealth 1 is as poorly concealed as you can be while still being unseen
by your enemies. Your Stealth TN has no bonus at this rank. You may
move and perform surprise attacks, as well as using items.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Stealth, Level
2<br>
Stealth 2 corresponds to being fairly well-hidden, having taken the
time to adjust yourself and your hiding spot as necessary--you're not
sticking your feet out past the edge of the rock you're hiding behind,
for example. From Stealth 2 you may perform surprise attacks, use
items, and prepare and perform sneak attacks. At this level of stealth,
your Stealth TN has a +5 bonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Stealth, Level
3<br>
Stealth 3 is as well-hidden as you can be. You are somehow camouflaged,
blending into your environment excellently. You may not move or attack,
but your Stealth TN has a +15 bonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Searching<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Understandably, situations arise when ninja want to find other, hidden
ninja.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Search (Speed 6)<br>
You look for hidden enemies, using your keen ninja senses. When you
make this action, roll your Awareness skill and compare it to the
Stealth TNs of all hidden enemies. If you get equal to or greater than
someone's Stealth TN, you have found them. As far as you're concerned,
they're no longer in stealth; they cannot perform surprise or sneak
attacks against you, you can attack them, and so forth.<br>
<br>
Every time you use a Search action consecutively (without taking a
non-Interrupt action between them) you get a stacking +2 bonus. Thus,
your third attempt to find someone would use your Awareness skill +4.<br>
<br>
If you are the one doing the hiding, you do not automatically know that
someone has discovered yor hiding place; until they do something
indicating they know where you are (such as attacking you, or running
straight at you), you think you're still hidden from them.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Point Out (Speed 3)<br>
You indicate where an enemy is hiding, typically by pointing at them
and yelling &amp;quot;There he is!&amp;quot; loudly. This
allows anyone else present to make a Search action immediately, as a
Speed 0 Interrupt, with an additional +5 bonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Actions From Stealth<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Surprise Attack<br>
Any attack you make while hidden is a surprise attack. Performing a
surprise attack ends your stealth, as you leap out and attack, or
otherwise reveal your location in the process.<br>
<br>
If an opponent chooses to use an Interrupt to defend against your
surprise attack, they may not lower its Speed by spending Action Points.<br>
<br>
Non-jutsu attacks with ranged weapons do not end your stealth. However,
each time you perform one it reduces your Stealth TN by 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Prepare Sneak Attack
(Speed Variable, Abort)<br>
You take the time to line up a perfect attack. You may abort this
action at any time, either as a normal abort, or to make your next
action a sneak attack.<br>
<br>
To use an action as a sneak attack, the total Speed that you used your
Prepare Sneak Attack action for must be at least equal to that of the
action you're using as a sneak attack. If you take another action
instead (such as moving to a new hiding spot, via another use of the
Hide action), you lose your opportunity to Sneak Attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Sneak Attack<br>
A sneak attack is an improved surprise attack, and as such, all normal
rules for surprise attacks apply. Additionally, any Accuracy penalties
inherent to the technique or weapon you're using are removed. Penalties
from other sources, such as visibility or wounds, are not negated.<br>
<br>
A sneak attack may be used as a special type of Interrupt. You can
Interrupt any action, taken by any person, with a sneak attack. They
may either complete their action, and be automatically hit by your
sneak attack, or call off their action and defend against your attack
normally. If they call their action off they do not pay its cost, but
their next action is still determined by their action's normal Speed.<br>
<br>
Sneak attacks may interrupt other actions as if their Speed was 1/4 is
actual value. For example, you have been preparing a sneak attack for
18 initiative counts, when your opponent declares a basic unarmed
attack (Speed 8) against your ally, on IC 80. You declare a sneak
attack interrupt. You use a taijutsu technique which normally has 30
Speed; you spend 14 action points to lower its Speed to 16 (less than
your 18 ICs of preparation). It now interrupts as if it was Speed (16/4
=) 4, which is half of the unarmed attack's 8, making it a valid
interrupt. Your opponent would be wise to call off their attack; if
they do so, they will not roll Stamina for their attack, they'll have
their next action on IC 88, and they can defend with any Interrupt of
Speed 8 (16/2 = 8) or lower.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Genjutsu<br>
Genjutsu can be used from level 1 and 2 stealth, and unlike other
jutsus does not break your concealment. However, it can never be a
sneak or surprise attack. Genjutsu techniques which require your
opponent to be able to perceive you cannot, for reasons that should be
largely self-evident, be used on somebody who you're hiding
from.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
================---================<br>
Pursuit<br>
================---================<br>
<br>
## Starting a Pursuit: <br>
<br>
If you and all the members of the squad you wish to form together with
are out of combat, or 100 Yards away from any (visible) enemy in
combat, you may start a Pursuit. This either reflects you going
somewhere, chasing someone, or running away from someone! You can do
this with any number of ninja, but a minimum of 3 is required for a
Formation. <br>
<br>
There are three important choices you must make when starting a
pursuit. If you are being thrown into a pursuit on the fly, read the
rules below marked with +++, otherwise, you first pick a Team Captain,
a Tactic, and finally a Formation.<br>
<br>
Team Captain - You nominate one of the ninja in your squad to make the
decisions for your group, it is important during a pursuit to do things
quickly without thinking, so the Captain delegates commands to others,
controlling the actions of the squad.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Once you have chosen your Team Captain,
determine your squad's Squad Speed. This is based on the lowest speed
of any member of your squad. Many things will add or remove percantages
to this. It will come up a lot, so remember this number! <br>
<br>
## How it Works: <br>
<br>
The distances squads can be apart are as follows, and are represented
in combat by a number of asterisks. They are also often referred to as
degrees: <br>
Very Close(1),<br>
Close(2),<br>
Nearby(3),<br>
Far(4),<br>
Very Far(5)<br>
<br>
<br>
Both Team Captains roll their initiatives, then both teams start
Nearby. Any members of either team use techniques to buff themselves at
this moment as long as they are speed 10 or less. If there was any
hidden enemies nearby you start 1 degree closer as the Hunted (or
further, if you are the Hunter).&nbsp; Unlike normal combat IC, you
each alternate turns, each action listed taking a whole turn. Every
turn, you gain 10% Squad Speed at the start. After both parties have
had a turn, you both compare Squad Speeds and the higher speed moves a
degree in their favor (Hunted move 1 away, Hunters move 1 closer).
Gaining or losing speed cannot cause you to go over +50% or under -50%,
unless otherwise stated. You continue to take turns this way until one
party is caught or gets away.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tactics - The way your team has decided on moving together gives you
distinct advantages and disadvantages. The different tactics effect how
you build speed and what you can do during a pursuit. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Force - Anytime your Squad speed would decrease,
it decreases by half the percentage. This includes when it changes to
another Formation and/or Tactic. You can use the Stop! action from
Close, and the Escape! action from Far. Your squad cannot be broken.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stealth - You only gain 5% Squad Speed per turn
instead of the standard 10%, but your speed cannot be reduced except by
changing Formation and/or Tactic. When you use a Volley you can choose
to hit them from the sides or center, or with a -5 penalty hit them
from the back (or front, if you are the Hunter). When you use the
Ambush action, you can do it from one degree further away. You also may
use a Stealth -10 in place of any defensive roll.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cunning - When you gain a percentage speed bonus
by any means, you can instead apply it as a penalty to the enemy squad.
When targetting a trap, you can choose 2 locations and roll a 1d2, or
with a -5 penalty you can choose which direction you want it to hit
from. As the Hunter, this makes your successful volleys knock the
Hunted one closer and you can use a volley from Far with a -10 penalty.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed - Your percentage caps are raised to +100%
max speed and -100% minimum. You gain +20% passively at the start of
each turn instead of the regular +10%, but any penalty to your speed is
twice the amount, and anything that moves your squad in a way other
than what you'd like moves you that way twice the amount. This includes
when it changes to another Formation or Tactic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Formations - The actual formation your squad moves in has
vulnerabilities and strengths of it's own. If a formation is hit from
it's vulnerable side, it is Broken until the squad assumes a new
formation. Any bonus you gain from a formation gains an additional +1
for every member you have over 3 in your squad.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Line - Running in a line, one man leading
single-file all the way to the end. You get a +5 to any Athletics and
Resistance roll and you are vulnerable to flanking. (The Side)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cross - The group is in a short line, with
people branching out from the front to cover the sides. You get +5
Stealth. Vulnerable to an attack from above. (The Back)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Circular - The group covers a nice area, seeing
all around them equally. You get +5 to any Awareness and Survival
checks your squad makes and you are vulnerable to direct assault.
(Center)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; V-Shaped - One ninja in the front, then fanning
out to both sides. You get +5 to any Espionage checks your squad makes
and you are vulnerable to rear assault. (The Front)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Broken - This is what your squad counts as if it
has less than 3 members, or something causes it to break. You no longer
gain a passive +10% speed per turn. If for some reason you cannot
decide on a squad leader, you are similiarly Broken.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
+++ If you were forced into a pursuit, either by fleeing from an enemy,
or from an enemy fleeing from you, there is a special way to handle
this! First, both teams get -50% Squad Speed for it being so abrupt.
After rolling initiatives, starting with the Team Captains, the teams
take turns voting on a Strategy and Tactic. First the Team Captain from
the Squad that won initiative votes, then the other team's Captain and
one other member vote, then two from the original team, then
alternating two members until there are none left. At the end, the
Hunter's Team Captain chooses a Strategy and Tactic. For every vote
they had for the ones they end up choosing, they get +10% Speed. (This
means if two members of your team voted for Force and V-Shaped, and you
voted for some different ones, but chose Force and V-Shaped, you'd get
+40% Squad Speed! 2 Votes for Force + 2 Votes for V-Shaped) The Hunted
chooses this as well, afterward, then the Pursuit begins.<br>
<br>
<br>
Actions in a Pursuit:<br>
<br>
There are two groups in a Pursuit, the Hunted (The ones being chased)
and the Hunter (The ones chasing). There are some actions they can both
take and some actions only the Hunter or Hunted can take. Any action
which calls for a skill roll uses the highest skill roll in your squad,
and only their roll. Any attack done by the Hunter can target the back
of the Hunted squad, or the center. Any attack done by the Hunted can
target the front of the Hunter squad, or the center.<br>
<br>
General Actions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Change Tactic and/or Formation - Doing this
causes you to choose a new Tactic and/or Formation, but you lose 30%
Squad Speed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Press On - You gain a +20% bonus to your Squad
Speed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Taijutsu Volley - This is (for the purposes of
damage only) a Speed 10 attack with (Athletics Rank)/5d12, with
physical damage bonus. Being hit by a volley lowers your Squad Speed by
10%. This can hit anyone up to Nearby, it's damage being dealt to the
whole enemy Squad, and it's strike is an Athletics vs. Athletics or
Resistance. You can choose to do either Slashing, Piercing, or Blunt
wounds with this. When you attack with this, as the Hunter you hit the
Hunted from the back, and the Hunted use this to hit the Hunter from
the front. You can choose to make your Athletics check at a -5 penalty
to roll [1d4] and hit the enemy from a random location. (1=Center,
2=Back, 3=Front, 4=Sides)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Ninjutsu Volley - This is (for the purposes of
damage only) a Speed 10 attack with Chakra Control Ranks/5d12, with
ninjutsu damage bonus. Being hit by a volley lowers your Squad Speed by
10%. This can hit anyone up to Nearby, it's damage is dealt to the
whole enemy squad, and it's strike is an Chakra Control vs. Athletics
or Resistance. You can choose any element someone in your squad can use
for wounds. When you attack with this, as the Hunter you hit the Hunted
from the back, and the Hunted use this to hit the Hunter from the
front. You can choose to make your Athletics check at a -5 penalty to
roll [1d4] and hit the enemy from a random location. (1=Center, 2=Back,
3=Front, 4=Sides)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Illusionary Assault - You can lower the bonus
percentage cap a squad can benefit from for their next turn. (A squad
that could move +50% faster can now only get to +25% faster) If you
lose speed from this, you do not gain it back when your cap returns to
normal. This is a standard Genjutsu roll, using the highest from both
squads. This can be done from Nearby.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Ambush - As the Hunter, you need to have
successfully sent a member to Cut-Off the enemy. You can then use this
if you're at least Close range. As Hunted you need to use it while they
are Close or further away. Roll a Stealth vs. Awareness (This is at a
-10 if you are the Hunted), if you succeed, you get into Ambush
position and you start combat, with each member who was part of the
Ambush starting in Level 2 Stealth, with a +10 bonus to their
initiative. If you fail, combat still starts, but the Ambushers have a
-10 to their Initiative and are not in Stealth. When the Hunted are
Ambushing, it's their whole Squad who get these penalties or bonuses,
when it's the Hunter, it's only the members sent in the cut-off.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hunter Actions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cut-off - You send a member or two of your squad
up and around, to try and position yourself for a nice Ambush. At the
end of the Hunted's next turn, roll an Espionage vs. Survival. If you
succeed, you are in position, and on your next 2 actions can use Ambush.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stop! - If you are in the Very Close position,
the Pursuit is over, the hunted is stopped, your side begins combat
with +5 on each player on your side's initiative.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Give Up the Chase - You can choose to move two
degrees away, if this would move you further than very far, you give up
chasing. Just in case they wanted to turn back around on you at one
point. If you do this three times but somehow don't leave pursuit they
can choose to start a new pursuit, with you as the Hunted, starting
from the distance you left off.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
Hunted Actions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Traps - Put down some traps! You lose 10% Squad
Speed to set up traps. At the end of the Hunter's next turn, roll 1d4,
as well as an Espionage vs. Survival. The 1d4 determines the direction
the traps strike from (1= Front, 2= Sides, 3=Back, 4=Center) If the
Hunters fail their Survival, their squad is moved one degree away. They
also each take (Espionage Ranks)/5d10 damage, with no damage bonus. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Escape! - If you are in the Very Far position,
the Pursuit is over, you have gotten away! It will take them a minimum
of one hour to pick up a reliable set of tracks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Sacrifice!!! - One of your members breaks off
from your formation and leads the enemy team away. They automatically
get one degree further away. The member who broke off now counts as a
seperate squad and their tactic is set to stealth. There are three
things the Hunter can choose on their next turn: To continue to pursue
the main group, to pursue this 'new group' or to let one of their
members leave their group to 1v1 the guy.<br>

<br>
====================<br>
1. Conditions<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Conditions cover the overall health, well-being, and, well, condition,
of your character. This lists the conditions, what they do, and where
to find more information about them. For how to remove unwanted
conditions, see the 'Recovery' section of this chapter.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Wounded<br>
Trained ninja can survive things that would kill or maim lesser humans,
but sometimes a single blow will be so powerful that even their
chakra-empowered, well-conditioned bodies cannot simply shrug off.
These are referred to as Wounds, and are explained in detail in the
'Wounds' section of this chapter. The effects, and healing
requirements, for each type of wound can be found there.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Fatigued<br>
This is the result of (over)exerting oneself in battle. Rules for
Fatigue, including how it's gained and the effects it has, are found in
the 'Fatigue' section.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Incapacitated<br>
When your HP reaches 0, you are incapacitated. You're not necessarily
unconscious, and you can still talk, but you're helpless, completely
unable to take any kind of action or effectively defend yourself. An
enemy who wants to can knock you unconscious with a single blow, or
deliver a coup de grace (A speed 10 attack that cannot be lowered by
any means) to render you dead.<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Unconscious<br>
One step up from incapacitated, this can result from being deliberately
knocked out, or from severe Fatigue. When unconscious you are subject
to all rules for being incapacitated, but cannot even talk or perceive
your environment.<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp; Dead<br>
Dying isn't as easy for ninja as normal people. There are two main ways
you can die. The first is simple, overwhelming damage: If you are
reduced to -100% HP, you die. The second is a coup de grace, a blow
specifically designed to be lethal. You may deliver a Coup de Grace
only against an Incapacitated or Unconscious opponent. A Coup de Grace
is a Speed 10, Delay 5 melee-ranged action.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Status Effects<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Status effects are things that will come and go throughout the course
of battle. They come in many forms, and from many different sources.<br>
<br>
Some status effects may occur automatically; most of the time. Others,
however, allow you a roll to avoid them. Typically, this will be called
a &amp;quot;status roll&amp;quot;, or a &amp;quot;(specific
status, such as burn) roll&amp;quot;. Saying that the victim gets a
Resistance roll against the effect is equivalent to saying that it has
a status roll.<br>
<br>
These rolls are either Chakra Control (for ninjutsu), Athletics (for
taijutsu--but this is uncommon, as those effects are usually
automatic), or Toxicology (for poisons). If anything else, that will be
noted.<br>
<br>
As implied above, the defender makes a Resistance skill check; if they
equal or exceed the status roll, they avoid its effects. If not, they
suffer them in full. Do keep in mind, if a technique or effect doesn't
say it allows a roll, that probably means any special effects it has
occur automatically.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many of these status effects will be found on damaging attacks--for
example, a sword slash that also causes its victim to start bleeding
profusely. If the damage of such an attack is reduced to 0, none of its
status effects will take place--with a few exceptions. Specifically,
Immobilize and Paralysis will apply even if the attack causing them
doesn't deal damage.<br>
Poison sometimes has special rules in this regard, but they can be
found in the appropriate section of the Equipment chapter.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Bleed<br>
Profuse bleeding from an injury. Among other things, this can ruin your
clothes; bloodstains absolutely refuse to come out of most fabrics.<br>
<br>
While bleeding, you lose Vitality (or HP) equal to double the severity
of the Bleed status every 5 IC, and have a penalty to your Stamina
rolls equal to its severity. Every 20 IC, you reduce the severity of
the status by RES/30 (after taking the damage).<br>
<br>
Bleeds from the same source do not stack; the higher one overwrites the
lower. Bleeds from different sources, however, all do their damage
separately, though you still use only the highest Bleed to determine
your Stamina penalty from the status.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Burns<br>
Generally resulting from exposure to fire or intense heat, such as some
katon jutsu, being burnt makes it harder to fight effectively. Your
Stamina rolls suffer a penalty equal to the strength of the burns on
you.<br>
<br>
You can suffer from multiple burn effects at the same time, though only
the strongest penalty is actually applied. Any effects which reduce
Stamina penalties reduce the severity of all your burns by the same
amount. Accordingly, when you move to the next Fatigue category you are
cleared of all burn effects.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Ignite<br>
You are on fire. Literally, you are burning. This is probably one of
the most excruciatingly painful experiences of your life.<br>
<br>
Ignite's effects are somewhat complicated. Like most statuses, it has a
severity. You suffer a -severity/2 penalty to your Stealth checks, and
every 5 IC you take damage equal to its severity, plus its severity in
percent of your current Vitality. Thus, an Ignite 10 would give you -5
to your Stealth and would deal 10 damage, plus 10% of your current
Vitality. Each time it does damage, you subtract (RES/20) from its
severity.<br>
<br>
If you have no Vitality remaining, it instead does damage equal to its
severity in percent of your maximum HP. The above Ignite 10 effect
would deal 10% of your maximum HP in damage.<br>
<br>
If someone ignites you again while you are already on fire (seriously,
what kind of people are you fighting?), the more severe effect replaces
the less severe one.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Immobility<br>
Immobilization effects are ones such as being stuck in mud or partially
bound with ropes. Every point of immobilization reduces your accuracy
and defense rolls by 1, and your AGI for the purposes of movement by
10%. Immobilization 10 is &amp;quot;completely
immobilized&amp;quot;; you cannot move at all, being rooted to your
location (you could still attack and even attempt to dodge, just at a
severe penalty). No matter how high your an immobilization penalty
gets, its actual applied penalty can never go beyond -10. Multiple
immobilization penalties do not stack; if you're suffering from a -8
and a -4, you ignore the -4 until the -8 goes away.<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp; Paralysis<br>
Paralysis differs from immobilization in that paralysis is an internal
or mental effect which impedes your ability to move, whereas
immobilization is generally used for effects which somehow physically
restrain you. <br>
<br>
When paralyzed, the base Speed of all your actions is increased by the
paralysis rating, to a maximum of double their original Speed. At the
same time, when determining damage from your attacks treat their Speed
as if it was (Paralysis severity) lower.<br>
<br>
For example, at Paralysis 3 your basic unarmed attack would be Speed
11; you could reduce it to a minimum of Speed (11/2 = 5.5) 6 with AP,
and then it would multiply your damage bonus by (6 - 3) 3. That same
Paralysis would change your dodge to a Speed 4 Interrupt (meaning that
some extremely quick, previously-avoidable attacks might become
undodgeable).<br>
<br>
Paralysis effects do not combine. If you are afflicted with two
paralysis effects at once, the more potent one overwrites the less
severe one. If they both have the same severity, the one with the
longer duration overwrites the other.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp; Poison<br>
When affected by a poison, you make a Resistance roll against some roll
of the opponent's. Success means that you shrug off the effects of the
poison. Failure means that you have been poisoned.<br>
<br>
Actual poisons may carry any number of effects, but the most prominent
is poison damage. For every IC that passes, you take damage equal to
the poison's rating, for the full duration of the poison. For example,
you're affected by a Poison 5 with a duration of 12. You take 5 damage
per IC, each IC, until 12 counts after when you were first affected,
for a total of 60 damage.<br>
<br>
You may be affected simultaneously by multiple poisons. However, a
single source (a specific jutsu or type of venom) may only affect you
once; another application of it while under its effects simply renews
the duration.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp; Sleep<br>
People sleep, generally because it's a necessary bodily function, but
sometimes because they've been influenced by mind-affecting genjutsu.
In reality, sleeping people are pretty much helpless. However, ninja
develop a sixth sense that warns them of impending danger and functions
even when not awake.<br>
<br>
If someone tries to attack or sneak up on you while asleep you
automatically wake up and can still roll initiative and/or defend
yourself, though do so at a -5 penalty until your first action after
waking up.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h.&nbsp; Stun<br>
Actions which stun you delay your actions by the magnitude of the stun.
For example, if your next action is on IC 14, and you are affected by a
Stun 5 effect, your next action would be on IC 19.<br>
<br>
Multiple stuns do not stack, but a newer one of higher magnitude will
overwrite the older. Thus, using the above example, if you were hit by
a Stun 7, your next action would be on IC (14+7) 21; if you were then
hit by a Stun 3, there would be no change.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp; Suffocation<br>
Someone or something is hindering your ability to breathe. Suffocation
penalties stack, from different sources or multiple ones. Your
suffocation penalty is applied to any Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion
rolls you make, and every time its value increases you have to make a
Stamina 15 roll.<br>
<br>
Unlike normal Fatigue-related penalties, suffocation is not reset to 0
when your Fatigue advances. When you stop being suffocated, your
suffocation penalty is reduced by 1 every 5 initiative counts.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j.&nbsp; Visibility<br>
These are penalties which reduce a person's ability to see clearly,
impairing the use of their most valuable sense in combat. Visibility
penalties do not stack; if you have a -6 and a -2, you ignore the -2
until the -6 is gone. The maximum visibility penalty you can suffer
from (after any increases and reductions) is -10.<br>
<br>
Total blindness is a -10 visibility penalty; one eye closed (or
removed!) is -3. A visibility penalty reduces your Accuracy and
Awareness by its value, and your defensive rolls by half (rounded down)
of its value; even without their sight, a ninja's sixth sense often
alerts them to danger and allows them to respond.<br>
<br>
Many visibility penalties affect areas: clouds of smoke or mist and the
like. In this case, you suffer the penalty when inside it, or when
trying to attack or watch (but not defend against) someone inside it.<br>
<br>
If it ever becomes relevant, closing or opening your eyes is a Speed 0
action--but not an Interrupt.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Other Effects<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Area of Effect<br>
Certain things apply not to an individual, but to all things within a
given area--their &amp;quot;area of effect&amp;quot;, or AoE.
These include things like explosions and smoke bombs<br>
<br>
The simpler type of AoEs are ones which are not directly offensive,
such as a smoke bomb or a jutsu that creates a thick cloud of mist.
These apply certain effects so long as you're in them, and can only be
avoided by moving out.<br>
<br>
Others, however, are attacks: they cause damage to everyone within an
area. Depending on that area, it may not even be possible to avoid one
effectively.<br>
<br>
When being subjected to an AoE attack, the first thing to determine is
if you can dodge it effectively. To do this, take the attack's Speed,
and determine how far you could move (see 'Actions') in that time. If
that distance is greater than the effect's radius, then
congratulations, you can dodge normally. If not, you have a -2 penalty
to Dodge per yard you're short by.<br>
<br>
As AoEs are not, strictly speaking, targeting you, they generally
cannot be parried. Other defenses, such as raising a ninjutsu-based
wall, are typically effective.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Knockback<br>
Certain jutsu have an effect referred to as
&amp;quot;knockback&amp;quot;, which does about what it sounds
like: pushes you away from its user or point of origin. Knockback is
measured in yards; a 10 yard knockback means that, if you are hit, you
will be moved 10 yards away from wherever the jutsu originated from.<br>
<br>
Some may have more complex rules, such as pushing you to the edge of
their area of effect.<br>
<br>
When a technique knocks you back a certain number of yards, if partial
defense applies then you will also reduce the knockback by that amount.<br>
<br>
The exception is area-of-effect knock backs centered on an individual
(such as a Hyuuga's Kaiten and the A-rank jutsu Eye of the Storm):
partial defense does not reduce the knockback from these, as they
essentially &amp;quot;push&amp;quot; everything away from them
equally.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Clones and Conditions<br>
Any clones you summon are subject to the same statuses and conditions
you are suffering from at the time you summon them. This includes
wounds or any status effect.<br>
<br>
Note: It may be a bad idea to make clones while on
fire.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
# Weather Conditions<br>
Weather Conditions<br>
There are a variety of conditions that happen in the world and many of
them can interfere with or change what you're doing. If you are safely
in the confines of your village, you do not have to use weather (Though
you can), but outside in a scene you must refer to the bottom of this
node.<br>
<br>
Fog<br>
-6 Visibility Penalty.<br>
Beyond 50 yards, the Visibility Penalty is doubled.<br>
<br>
Heavy Rain <br>
-2 Visibility Penalty.<br>
Immobilization Penalty 1.<br>
-5 to Survival when Tracking.<br>
For any Suiton you use, there always counts as being 5 free gallons you
can use per technique.<br>
This adds a +3 Chakra cost to each Katon jutsu.<br>
<br>
Snow<br>
Paralysis 1 Always, unless you have D-rank Suiton Technique Pool of
Water or Waterwalking.<br>
+5 to Survival when Tracking.<br>
<br>
Hail<br>
-4 Visibilty Penalty.<br>
Every 20 IC you've been in combat in the open, you take a Minor Blunt
wound.<br>
<br>
Heavy Cold<br>
Water tends to freeze quickly, 1 Gallon being frozen per 20 IC. <br>
-3 to All Skills.<br>
Every time your Chakra penalty increases, it increases by one more.<br>
<br>
Heavy Heat<br>
Suiton require double the amount of water.<br>
Every time your Stamina penalty increases, it increases by one more.<br>
<br>
High Winds<br>
Immobilization Penalty 2<br>
+3 Speed on Fuuton for purposes of damage only.<br>

Every 20 IC the effects of the E-rank Fuuton Technique Cleansing Wind
is used.<br>
<br>
High Air Pressure<br>
-3 Speed on Fuuton for purposes of damage only.<br>
Breathing isn't as easy as normal. You must make a Stamina check every
20 IC with a TN of 5+5*Your current Fatigue level. This CANNOT be
combined with Low Air Pressure. Oxygen Mask makes you not have to roll
this check. <br>
<br>
Low Air Pressure<br>
Fuuton does -20% damage for the purposes of Wounding.<br>
Low air pressure means air is much &amp;quot;thinner&amp;quot;
than normal. Make a Resistance check every 20 IC (or 10 minutes out of
combat), TN 10, increased by 5 every time you succeed, to a maximum of
50, or you suffer from a Major Blunt Head wound for the next 20 IC (or
10 minutes out of combat). Rest action can reduce TN by 5, to a minimum
of 5. This CANNOT be combined with High Air Pressure. Oxygen Mask makes
you not have to roll this check. <br>
<br>
Clear Skies<br>
Not a single cloud in sight, or maybe a few small ones. No penalties or
bonuses!<br>
<br>
<br>
Extreme Weather: <br>
Warning, being in these conditions can not only be dangerous to your
health, you could very well die.<br>
<br>
Smog<br>
This has the effects of Fog and Low Air Pressure.<br>
Every 20 IC you suffer from Suffocation 1 (Oxygen mask prevents further
Suffocation stacks, and removes 1 Stack every 2 IC you spend wearing
the mask). This caps at 5.<br>
<br>
Storm<br>
This has the effects of High Winds and Heavy Rain.<br>
You lose Enhanced Hearing and Blind Fighting bonuses, and Offensive
genjutsu have a -3 Penalty.<br>
If you wield a metallic weapon during a Storm, you roll a 1d100 every
10 IC. If you roll a 1-5, you are struck by a bolt of lightning! Defend
against an Accuracy 80 Tenchu with an NDB of 30!<br>
<br>
Sandstorm<br>
This has the effects of High Winds and Heavy Heat.<br>
Every 20 IC you suffer from Burns 1, which escalates by 1 every 20 IC.
If you have more than DR 10 this doesn't effect you.<br>
-8 Visibility Penalty and every 5 IC you suffer from Suffocation 1.
This caps at 5. Oxygen Mask makes you immune to these effects.<br>
Every 10 IC you don't move your Immobilization penalty increases by 1.
This additional penalty can be lowered by 1 by moving 3 yards. If this
makes your Immobilization 10 or more, your Suffocation penalty from
Sandstorm is uncapped.<br>
Every 20 IC you've been in combat in the open, you take a Minor
Slashing wound.<br>
<br>
Blizzard<br>
Now, you wish you didn't mention that Touu's mother.<br>
This has the effects of High Winds and Heavy Cold.<br>
-6 Visibility Penalty.<br>
Paralysis 2 Always, unless you have Watershoes or Waterwalking. Then
it's Paralysis 1.<br>
Every 20 IC you've been in combat in the open, you take a Minor
Piercing wound.<br>

# Fatigue<br>
&gt; 1. Stamina<br>
2. Chakra Exhaustion<br>
3. Fatigue<br>
4. Example<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Stamina<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
People get tired; it just happens, even to supernaturally-empowered
ninja. To represent this, certain attacks have a stamina cost, listed
in a format such as &amp;quot;Stamina: 10.&amp;quot;<br>
<br>
Whenever you use a move with a listed Stamina cost, you make a stamina
roll: 1d20+RES/10. Regardless of the result, your attack is resolved
normally. However, if you got less than the TN for your roll (that is,
the move's Stamina rating) your Fatigue is raised by one category.<br>
<br>
Realistically, continued exertion even at the same level will tire
people out. Every time you make a stamina roll, you incur a penalty
equal to (the Stamina cost)/5, rounded down, on all future Stamina
rolls you make.<br>
<br>
This penalty is reset to 0 every time you advance a Fatigue category,
and at the end of battle. It can also be reduced by spending your time
Resting in combat.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Chakra Exhaustion<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The counterpart to stamina. Shinobi have the ability to use all manner
of fantastic abilities by drawing on the chakra within themselves and
manipulating the environment. While very potent, this energy comes from
their body, and it's easy for a shinobi, especially an inexperienced
one, to overtax themselves.<br>
<br>
Ninjutsu and genjutsu moves have a chakra cost, listed in a form such
as &amp;quot;Chakra: 10.&amp;quot; When you use these moves,
you make a roll against Chakra Exhaustion; to pass, you must get equal
to or greater than the technique's cost on a roll of 1d20+CHA/10. If
you fail, your Fatigue is raised one category. Whether you pass or
fail, your jutsu works normally.<br>
<br>
The more chakra a shinobi spends, the more strain they put on their
body. Whenever you make a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you incur a penalty
equal to (the technique's Chakra cost)/5, rounded down, on all future
Chakra Exhaustion rolls you make.<br>
<br>
This penalty is reset to 0 every time your Fatigue category increases,
and at the end of battle.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Fatigue<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Fatigue represents the effects of weariness on your body. Shinobi can
push themselves well beyond normal human capabilities, often displaying
determination that exceeds their body's limits.<br>
<br>
You begin a battle at Fatigue 0. Whenever you fail a Stamina or Chakra
Exhaustion roll, your Fatigue increments up one category, and your
penalties to both those rolls reset to 0.<br>
<br>
For every 15 points you fail a roll by, you automatically advance an
additional Fatigue category; thus, rolling a 12 on a Stamina 45
technique would cause you to advance 1+(45-12)/15 = 3 Fatigue
categories.<br>
<br>
For each level of Fatigue, you apply the following effects:<br>
-1 to your Accuracy, offensive rolls, and skill rolls<br>
-2 to your defensive rolls<br>
+5 to your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls<br>
<br>
Fatigue only goes up to 5. If you fail a Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina
roll when at Fatigue 5, you complete your action and then fall
unconscious, your body pushed beyond its limits.<br>
<br>
One exception to that last paragraph, though. If you fail a technique
badly enough that you would advance a Fatigue level beyond
unconsciousness, the technique you were using fails to activate. Thus,
say you're at Fatigue 4, and you fail a technique by 32 points. Failing
it advances you to Fatigue 5; the first 15 points you fail it by
advances you a second Fatigue category, placing you unconscious;
however, you failed by another 15 points, and so not only are you
unconscious, but your technique also fails to activate.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Example<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Naruto and Sasuke are fighting over who shall be Sakura's boyfriend. <br>
<br>
Sasuke starts accosting his nemesis with multiple Shishio Rendan
attacks, a Stamina 15 technique. The first, he rolls a plain 1d20+7,
with a total of 16, narrowly avoiding failure. Still, he's angry, and
he keeps going. The next roll is 1d20+7-3; and, the next, 1d20+7-6.
Both times he passes.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to exhaust himself too quickly, Sasuke switches to his
ninjutsu, tossing off a Grand Fireball, a ninjutsu with a Chakra cost
of 16. He rolls his 1d20+6, and passes the roll. He follows that with a
Housenka (Chakra cost 14), rolls 1d20+6-3 for Chakra Exhaustion, and
again passes his check.<br>
<br>
At this point, Sasuke's next Stamina check will have a -9 penalty, and
his next Chakra Exhaustion roll will have a -5 penalty.<br>
<br>
Deciding that he'll probably fail his next roll regardless, he attacks
with an impressive Chidori: the move has a Chakra Cost of 25, meaning
there's no way he can pass its Chakra Exhaustion check. As expected,
Sasuke fails, and advances to Fatigue 1.<br>
<br>
At this point, his Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls both have their
penalty reset to 0, and since he's Fatigued, those rolls also have a +5
bonus. He considers following immediately with another Chidori (he'd
have a small chance of avoiding failure; a roll of 14 or better,
14+6+5=25, would be sufficient), but instead decides to pace
himself.&lt;/&gt;<br>

# Wounds<br>
<br>
&gt;1. Explanation<br>
2. Wound Categories<br>
3. Damage Types<br>
4. Location<br>
5. Called Shots<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Explanation<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Shinobi can, and frequently do, endure beatings that would leave
ordinary people as lifeless, mangled pulps--something about the
increased flow of chakra and physical conditioning giving them
unnatural durability.<br>
<br>
Enough of a beating, over a long enough period of time, will still
bring a ninja down, but little things like getting knocked off a roof
or stabbed with a knife are not nearly so fatal as they'd be for normal
people.<br>
<br>
Even so, some blows are too much to just shrug off. These are called
wounds, injuries that have some lasting effect on your ability to fight.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Wound Categories<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Wounds are divided into four categories, based on their severity:
Minor, Major, Severe, and Critical.<br>
<br>
Simply put, you acquire wounds by taking too much damage at once. When
a single source of damage deals more than a certain percent of your
maximum Vitality at once, you suffer a wound of the corresponding
severity.<br>
Minor: 10%<br>
Major: 25%<br>
Severe: 50%<br>
Critical: 75%<br>
<br>
Damage dealt to your HP wounds you based on your maximum HP, as should
make sense! However, the percentages are higher, to offset HP being
much lower than Vitality<br>
Minor: 25%<br>
Major: 50%<br>
Severe: 75%<br>
<br>
For the sake of demonstration, we'll say that you have 600 Vitality,
and 200 HP. An attack hits you for 100 damage. If you take this damage
to your vitality (16%), you suffer one Minor wound. If you take it to
your HP (50%), you'd instead suffer a Major wound.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you had 60 Vitality remaining when that same
attack hit, you'd lose 60 Vitality (10%) and 40 HP (25%), resulting in
two Minor wounds.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Damage Types<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
After determining the severity of a wound, the next (fairly simple!)
step is determining what type of wound it is. Being cut by a sword and
being hit by a magical ninja fireball, even if they do the same amount
of damage, have significantly different effects on the human body.<br>
<br>
For the most part this is self-explanatory, with only four damage types
recognized: Blunt, Slashing, Piercing, and Energy.<br>
<br>
Unarmed attacks are always blunt damage, nice and simple.<br>
<br>
Weapons have their damage type, or types, listed in their descriptions.
If a weapon can do multiple types of damage, the attacker declares
which type of wound they'll be inflicting after the severity is
confirmed, but before the location is determined. Some weapon jutsu
require a weapon of a specific damage type to be used; in this case,
damage from that jutsu is considered to be of that type.<br>
<br>
Ninjutsu are simpler than weapons! <br>
Katon and Raiton jutsu inflict energy damage.<br>
Doton and Suiton inflict blunt damage.<br>
Fuuton inflicts slashing damage.<br>
An exception! Some jutsu augment a weapon strike, or actually create a
weapon. In these cases, use the damage type of that weapon, not the
element it was made from.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Location<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
After determining severity and damage type, you roll to determine
location--where you hit, and what you injured. It's all well and good
to say you threw a punch at their face, but this is battle, with
ninjas! Things rarely go as planned.<br>
<br>
You roll a percentile die (1d100) for location, and check the relevant
damage type's wound list, under the appropriate severity, to determine
the effect. If it's an arm or leg that's been wounded, odds on the
1d100 are the right arm, and evens the left.<br>
<br>
This all gets simpler if the defender is blocking; in that case, they
choose the location.<br>
<br>
Multiple wounds, even multiples of the same effect, stack. Two broken
left arms means that your arm is broken twice, with double the normal
penalties.<br>
<br>
One exception. If you suffer a critical wound, it overrides all lesser
wounds on that location--having an arm reduced to useless deadweight
makes the fact that it's broken in six places kind of, well,
irrelevant. Two criticals in the same place, however, is oh so very
possible.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Called Shots<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Normally, when you attack your only real goal is hitting the enemy as
hard as possible--you might plan on aiming a punch at their stomach,
but if they duck down you're not going to be picky: you'll sock them
square between the eyes.<br>
<br>
A called shot is an attack specifically targeting a certain location.
After checking your attack's damage type, choose any of the locations
which can be Wounded by damage of that type. You declare that when you
make your attack, for example, &amp;quot;Hinotama, Called Shot:
Arm&amp;quot;.<br>
<br>
The attack has a -4 Accuracy penalty. However, if it hits any wounds it
inflicts will automatically be dealt to that
location.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
### Blunt (Minor)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Ringing Noise (Head)<br>
o/~ There's a drumming noise inside my head that starts when... o/~ ...
uh, right. But, yeah, it's pretty distracting. This gives a -1 penalty
to all d20 rolls, aside from Genjutsu defenses; it's -2 for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Bruised Ribs (Torso)<br>
As in the bones, not the skin over them. Truth is, ribs hurt a lot more
than they have any business doing. Breathing hurts in particular, deep
breathing especially so. This increases the Speed of all your actions
by 1, similar to Paralysis. You'll recover from this at the end of the
week.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Winded (Abdomen)<br>
A good shot to the gut hit your solar plexus or compressed your
diaphragm, or both, knocking the wind out of you. You'll be fine,
definitely, but this increases your Stamina penalty by 4 and applies a
Stun 4.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Bruised (Arm)<br>
Your arm is bruised. It hurts. This gives a -1 Accuracy penalty
(because of the pain being distracting, if you're attacking without
using the arm) and increases your Seal Speeds by 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Bruised (Leg)<br>
Something hit your leg and now it hurts! You'll feel better after you
walk it off (or just sit down and let the pain fade). Until the end of
battle this reduces your base movement speed by 10% and applies a -1
penalty to dodge rolls.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Blunt (Major)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Dazed (Head)<br>
That one left you reeling. Once you're done seeing stars, you'll be...
mostly okay. You lose any AP you currently have, and all effects with
Upkeeps (other than doujutsu) end as you lose your concentration. If
you're standing on water or a wall, you'll fall, too.<br>
<br>
Everything seems just a little bit... off, about the world, though you
can't quite place what. Sounds are muffled, colors muted, and things
keep moving at the edge of your vision. This distraction provides a -3
penalty to all skill checks and defensive genjutsu rolls. It lasts for
two weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Collapsed Lung (Torso)<br>
Your lung quit its day job; unfortuantely, that day job was letting you
breathe. Your Fatigue rolls have a -4 penalty; you can live with both
lungs collapsed, though that raises the penalty to -12 (rather than
just -8).<br>
<br>
It takes only a week of medical treatment to get over this, but it
won't get better without that treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Groin Shot (Abdomen)<br>
If this was a called shot, you should probably having a serious talk
with your opponent about what constitutes fair fighting. Even ninja
have standards!<br>
<br>
It's a Stun 7, and you probably feel more than a little nauseous. Don't
be ashamed about doubling over and whimpering, either! Until it's
healed (2 weeks for that, 4 without rest) your Agility stat is
considered 25% lower for determining how fast you can move. On top of
that, you have a -3 penalty to Resistance rolls until your recovery's
complete.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Sprained Arm (Arm)<br>
Your elbow or wrist was forced to bend in a way it's not meant to by
the blow, and sprained in the process. This gives a -4 penalty to
rolls, and Accuracy of attacks, using that arm (such as grapple checks,
and all two handed weapons). Single-handed weapons held in the other
hand, ninjutsu, and taijutsu jutsu which specify they're only kicks
suffer only a -2.<br>
<br>
It also increases your Seal Speeds by 5. It takes four weeks to
recover. Weeks in which you use that arm in combat don't count towards
the recovery time.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Sprained Leg (Leg)<br>
The muscles and ligaments in your knee or ankle were stretched beyond
their capacity. Any time you move, including dodging, the pain leaves
your Accuracy and d20 rolls at a -4 penalty for the next 15 IC.<br>
<br>
It takes a month for the sprain to heal, or twice that long without
rest.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Blunt (Severe)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Concussion (Head)<br>
Somebody turned out the lights. It is very dark, and you are likely to
be eaten by a grue. Thankfully, you get over that before your enemies
can capitalize on it (or you're eaten).<br>
<br>
This imposes a -5 penalty on all d20 rolls, and halves (round down) the
amount of AP you gain. Whenever you suffer a head wound, you have a 10%
chance per level of the wound to be knocked unconscious. Any time this
happens, your recovery time is reset.<br>
<br>
It takes six weeks of rest to recover from a concussion, or twelve
weeks without rest. Medical treatment won't help it get better any
faster.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Broken Ribs<br>
You are in horrible, terrible pain. You'd be screaming and/or mewling,
if you weren't a ninja! Breathing feels like you're being stabbed--and
depending on how badly broken those ribs are, that might be exactly
what's happening.<br>
<br>
The effectiveness of blocking is reduced by 25% (from 50% to 25% for
most attacks, and 25% to ineffective against weapons), and you have a
-4 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls. The Speed of all actions you take
is increased by 2.<br>
<br>
Blocking's effectiveness is restored by 5% for every two weeks of rest
you have. Once you've fully recovered from that penalty, the penalties
to Accuracy, rolls, and Speed also disappear.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Crushed Organ (Abdomen)<br>
It's not as bad as it sounds, honestly. There's some severe bleeding
and bruising inside the organ itself, and it hurts horrendously, but
it's not bleeding out into other parts of your body--meaning it can
only possibly get so bad. Your max HP and Vitality are reduced by 10%
(and your current values of both by 10% of your maximum), and you have
a -5 penalty to Resistance rolls.<br>
<br>
The reduction is lowered by 1% per week of rest you have, and the
Resistance penalty by 1 per 2 weeks of rest.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Broken Arm (Arm)<br>
Your arm can't be used in grapples, and you have a -5 penalty to all
grapple rolls. It can't be used to hold two-handed weapons, and
attempting to use it for any other sort of taijutsu (unarmed or weapon)
incurs a -5 Accuracy penalty and denies you your damage bonus for that
action.<br>
<br>
You can still form handseals, though when you finish doing so make a
Resistance roll with a -10 penalty against the base Seal Speed; failure
means you flinch, and while you get your jutsu off just fine you
inflict yourself with a Stun 12.<br>
<br>
Two months of not using the arm will be sufficient for it to heal.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Broken Leg (Leg)<br>
Severe damage to your leg has left you with a reduced ability to
locomote around the battlefield! If worst comes to worst, you can still
power-hobble on it; it doesn't directly penalize your movement, but
moving has a Stun 4 added to it (even moving as part of an attack).<br>
<br>
So long as your leg is broken, you can't use any jutsu or abilities
that increase your movement speed.<br>
<br>
Your leg won't get better if you're walking around on it. If you walk
with crutches (or a cane, or something of the sort) you can move at
only half speed, but it counts as 'rest' for the purpose of recovering
from this wound, which takes a total of two months. Each time you opt
to run around unaided on it extends the remaining recovering time by a
week.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Blunt (Critical)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Fractured Skull (Head)<br>
You got hit in the head hard enough that you're lucky you don't have
(much) brain damage. This will usually be accompanied by nasty
lacerations and prolific bleeding, but not always.<br>
<br>
Aside from a Stun 15, you suffer a -5 penalty to accuracy and all d20
rolls, doubled for skill checks.<br>
<br>
This takes 4 OOC weeks to fully heal. Any time in that period that you
suffer a Head Wound, of any type or severity, roll 1d20. On 1 - 10, you
suffer the wound normally. On a roll of 11 - 20, you're unconscious and
comatose until that wound fully heals (even if that takes longer than
it does for your Fractured Skull to finish healing). You'll always be
comatose for a minimum of 24 hours, even for a Minor head wound.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Sternal Fracture (Torso)<br>
Your sternum is that rather lengthy, thoroughly sturdy piece of bone
and cartiliage that runs down the middle of your chest that all your
ribs connect to. They're pretty hard to break. Nice job pulling that
one off.<br>
<br>
This in itself isn't terribly bad, but whatever hit you with enough
force to do that off also managed to break several ribs and cause some
significant internal damage. It's pretty easy to tell your chest is
just about ruined: there's a grinding nose of bone on bone whenever you
breathe or try to move too much, for one thing; the agonizing pain's a
pretty good hint, too.<br>
<br>
This imposes a -15 penalty on all Stamina checks, and reduces your
damage bonuses by half. It also imposes a -5 penalty on all defensive
rolls.<br>
<br>
Every two weeks of rest reduces the Stamina penalty by 1. Once that
penalty reaches -10, your damage bonuses return to normal. Once it
reaches -5, your defensive actions stop being penalized.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Rupture (Abdomen)<br>
Your abdomen's important because it's full of all sorts of squishy
parts that are pretty important for your continued survival. Whatevr
kind of trauma you just went through ruptured one of those squishy
bits, and now it's bleeding out all over your insides. Yes, blood
belongs inside you, but... not actually inside your abdominal cavity.<br>
<br>
Every time you act, including movement, you lose HP (not Vitality)
equal to the Speed of the action, and an addtional 1 HP every 5 IC. In
theory, this could even Wound you again.<br>
<br>
Treating this with First Aid requires a Medicine skill of at least 10,
and generally involves cutting open the victim's abdomen and letting it
drain (or, in rare cases, ventilate) before figuring out what's
actually bleeding and making it stop. It's a Speed 25 action to treat
this Wound, but it stops the persistent HP loss.<br>
<br>
Any time you take an action, you have a 5*(action's Sped)% chance of
causing the injury to act up again, bringing back all its lovely
effects and requiring treatment (via First Aid or actual medical
treatment) to bring it back under control again. Every four consecutive
weeks you go without incurring this effect, the multiplier is reduced
by 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Shattered Arm (Arm)<br>
You arm is so broken that the breaks have breaks. It's useless. You
can't perform handseals, hold weapons or use items with it, and so
forth. The pain is horrible and makes it virtually impossible to
concentrate, imposing a -6 penalty to d20 rolls and Accuracy, and a -4
penalty to Fatigue checks.<br>
<br>
After four weeks of medical treatment, the pain will be manageable, and
the penalties will be reduced to a mere -3 Accuracy (though you still
can't use the arm). Only after that will it begin to actually heal,
which takes a total of twenty weeks, or thirty without medical
treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Shattered Leg (Leg)<br>
There are broken legs, there are severely broken legs, and then there's
your leg. You can't stand without something to prop you up, but because
you're a tough-as-nails and super-resourceful ninja you can still move,
though the distance you move is divided by 4. You have a -8 penalty to
dodge, and -4 to other d20 rolls.<br>
<br>
Once you've had two weeks of medical treatment and been put in a
splint, you can walk So long as you carry a crutch, cane, or walking
stick (which does occupy a hand), you can move at half speed, and
suffer only halve the above penalties. You can do so without out,
though each time you take any action which requires you to move
(including dodging), or are hit, you have a 50% chance of your leg
giving out, and suffering all the regular penalties.<br>
<br>
Once you've received treatment, it takes 30 OOC days to heal, half when
receiving full-time medical treatment.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Slashing (Minor)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Blood in Eyes (Head)<br>
Oh no you're bleeding from the face. Because fights msut be dramatic,
the attack has cut in such as way (maybe right across your eyelid,
maybe over the forehead) that blood is now dripping into your eyes,
causing a continual distraction. This imposes a -2 visibility penalty.
You can wipe the blood from your eyes, a Speed 3 action, which removes
that penalty for the next 10 IC.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Armor Tear (Torso)<br>
Something managed to slice right across your chest, hacking your armor
right off your body.&nbsp; On top of being a fairly nasty gash
which is likely to scar if not given stitches, you have a Bleed 4
effect, and any armor you're wearing is removed (But clothing is still
there!). Armor which specifically applies to only a different location
(such as your head) is not lost.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Sliced Stomach (Abdomen)<br>
This is what happens when you can't make your body concave
enough.&nbsp; You get cut right across the belly.&nbsp;
Fortunately it isn't that bad, it's just in a bad spot.&nbsp; Your
Stamina and Chakra costs are all increased by 2 until the end of the
battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Lacerated (Arm)<br>
You got a nasty gash running along your arm.&nbsp; It didn't cut
anything vital, but blood is seeping down your arm and off your
fingertips.&nbsp; All Seal Speeds are made at +2 (unless you can do
them one-handed, then you can avoid this by using the unwounded arm),
and you have a -2 to all grapple checks.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Lacerated (Leg)<br>
You got a nasty gash running along your leg.&nbsp; It's not
life-threatening, but it is staining your clothes and oozing down your
leg.&nbsp; You have a -1 immobilization penalty that will fade
after 20 IC, but anytime you take a move action (moving as part of an
attack action is fine, but using Shunshin is not), the wound will
reopen, applying another -1 immobilization penalty with +5 IC in
duration.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Slashing (Major)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Profuse Bleeding (Head)<br>
You got a gash on your face, maybe a slice into your cheek. You're
bleeding a lot! Head injuries are like that. The blood loss isn't the
issue; the fact that that blood is running over your face and getting
in your mouth is.<br>
<br>
As your mouth fills with blood, it becomes progressively harder to
breathe (and not vomit), causing a Suffocation 1 effect every 20 IC.
Whenever you Rest, the severity of this Suffocation effect is reduced
by 1.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for you, it's amazingly easy to get this kind of wound
infected, so it will not heal without medical treatment.&nbsp; With
medical treatment, it takes three weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Pulmonary Gash (Chest)<br>
Something managed to cut through your pectoral muscle and between your
ribs to knick your lung.&nbsp; A pretty impressive feat, but if
they were a real badass they would get your heart (be sure to taunt
them about that).<br>
<br>
This inflicts a Bleed effect of 3*Fatigue Level, minimum 3.&nbsp;
Every time their fatigue level increases, they get a Bleed 3 effect--If
they were already suffering from this, then the existing bleed is
increased by 3.<br>
<br>
Luckily it's a deep but narrow injury, so it tends to heal fairly
quick.&nbsp; It takes two weeks to recover from, with or without
treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Open Cavity (Abdomen)<br>
Your abdominal cavity--the part of your body that holds all your
abdominal organs in together in a nice, safe environment--has been
opened, and it really wasn't meant to be.<br>
<br>
You can no longer Rest.&nbsp; Your bonus to Stamina and Chakra
Exhaustion rolls based from Fatigue are is reduced to +3 per Fatigue
level (rather than +5).&nbsp; The penalty you incur from passing a
Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll is (the action's cost)/4, rather than
(the action's cost)/5.<br>
<br>
This takes a month to heal.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Muscle Tear (Arm)<br>
Your bicep and/or tricep have been partially torn, which tends to make
it a lot harder to function effectively in combat, as your arm goes
from a dry noodle to a limp one.<br>
<br>
Your STR is reduced by 25%.&nbsp; This affects everything derived
from your STR score you're hoping it doesn't (Vitality, Damage Bonus,
damage dice with taijutsu, etc).&nbsp; This heals at a rate of 5%
per two weeks without medical attention or rest, or 5% per week in a
hospital.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Muscle Tear (Leg)<br>
Your quadriceps have been torn.&nbsp; Not to fear, the tendon is
fine and you haven't been hamstrung, you're not going to be put down
like an animal (though this should teach you to treat pets better).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, your AGI is reduced by 25%.&nbsp; This affects
everything derived from your AGI score you're hoping it doesn't (Dodge,
Initiative, max AP, movement speed).&nbsp; This heals at a rate of
5% per two weeks without medical attention or rest, or 5% per week with
medical treatment.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
### Slashing (Severe)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Avulsed Ear (Head)<br>
You have a nasty cut right across your ear! Not only does this look
pretty brutal, but there's blood seeping into your inner ear, which can
do some nasty things to your sense of coordination.<br>
<br>
If you have the Enhanced Hearing ability, you lose all benefits from
it, as well as any abilities which depend on it (such as Blind
Fighting). With blood pooling in the ear making it difficult to keep
your sense of balance, the highest level of Taijutsu you can perform is
reduced by one (From A&nbsp; to B, B to C, C to D/etc).<br>
<br>
You're also treated as being on Fatigue category *higher* than you
actually are for the purpose of penalties (but not benefits), meaning
that if you're at Fatigue 1, you have a -2 to Accuracy and -4 to
Defensive rolls, instead of the normal -1/-2.&nbsp; Under normal
circumstances, this means you also fall unconscious at Fatigue 4,
instead of Fatigue 5.<br>
<br>
The blood can be drained from the ear easily with medical attention,
but can't be treated in battle.&nbsp; It will heal on its own (and
probably scar) in eight weeks, or four weeks (and probably not scar) if
you have medical attention.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Clavicle Cut (Torso)<br>
The horizontal bone that connects your sternum to your scapula has been
fractured.&nbsp; More than likely, it's possible you can even feel
part of the bone that's jutting out from the skin, if you try to look
down at it.<br>
<br>
The worst part of it is the pain, which can't really be avoided because
of how the clavicle helps the scapula keep in position to let the arm
hang. This inflicts a -2 to Accuracy and d20 rolls, and a Paralysis
4.&nbsp; Any time you perform an action with a Stamina cost, you
take twice that amount in damage, which bypasses reductions (such as
DR).<br>
<br>
Crash course in anatomy, you have two clavicles. If the result was odd,
it's your right; even, your left. With proper medical attention (a trip
to a doctor, or a Medicine roll of 20 or higher using a First Aid kit,
you or someone else) you can get the arm completely immobilized against
your body. This reduces the Paralysis to 2, and halves the damage taken
when you make Stamina rolls, but means you cannot use that arm or hand
at all.<br>
<br>
It takes 6 weeks to heal, with or without medical treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Chopped Liver (Abdomen)<br>
Your liver has been cut.&nbsp; There's really no good side to this
one, it pretty much sucks.&nbsp; The liver happens to have quite a
few functions, namely helping against toxins and the digestion of
proteins.&nbsp; It's kind of vital to live, and it happens to be
bleeding out at a very significant rate.<br>
<br>
This applies a Bleed 10 effect. Whenever you take an action with a
Speed greater than the severity of your current Bleed from this wound
(even if it's gone down to Bleed 0), that Bleed's severity increases by
2.<br>
<br>
This also impedes your body's ability to process chemicals properly. If
you're under the effects of a Soldier or Blood Pill, they end
immediately (including the reduction of a Fatigue level, which can
knock you unconscious). Taking either pill with this wound results in
no beneficial effect taking place. The Akimichi clan's pills still work
normally.<br>
<br>
This takes ten weeks to recover from, down to five with medical
attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Hand of Benediction (Arm)<br>
No, the name's not a joke, and I have no idea why you think it would
be. It's a real term!<br>
<br>
Somehow, the median nerve around the elbow has been severed, resulting
in a loss of proper hand function.&nbsp; It doesn't hurt that much
since it was a nerve that was struck, but your pinky and ring fingers
are no longer able to be felt or manipulated at all, and your thumb is
more or less unopposable. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
For starters, if you had anything in your hand at the time (evens for
left, odds for right), you're automatically disarmed.&nbsp; The
same is true for any two-handed weapon you might be holding.&nbsp;
You can not wield a weapon in that hand, and any unarmed attacks made
with the affected limb do not receive your damage bonus.<br>
<br>
Your DEX bonus to Accuracy is now DEX/20 and Seal Speeds are increased
by 50%, before any reductions are applied to them (such as uniques,
DEX/10, etc).&nbsp; You can avoid the increase in Seal Speed by
performing your seals one-handed, using the opposite hand--if you're
able to do so.<br>
<br>
This will not heal without treatment:&nbsp; Nerves are tricky
things which require medical ninjutsu to properly restore.&nbsp;
With medical attention, it takes seven weeks to heal.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Hamstrung (Leg)<br>
One of the major tendons of the leg, located behind the femur, have
been cut.&nbsp; You're now unable to walk or stand properly, more
or less, and running is completely out of the equation.<br>
<br>
You're automatically prone, as if tripped (See the E-rank Taijutsu for
its penalties), and your AGI bonus to Dodge is now AGI/20.&nbsp;
Even when you get up, your movement speed is cut in half, and you can
no longer move as part of an attack.&nbsp; You can still use jutsu
to increase your rate of movement, but the total distance moved is
halved.<br>
<br>
You gain AGI/20 AP, instead of normal, and your AP cap is now AGI/4.
Any Athletics rolls you make use only half of your total ranks in the
skill.<br>
<br>
If you manage to survive the fight which caused this (props for that,
since you're a sitting duck), it takes twelve weeks to recover from, or
six with medical attention.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
### Slashing (Critical)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Cut Throat (Head)<br>
The good news: you were not beheaded.&nbsp; The bad news: They
didn't fail by much.&nbsp; Your carotid artery was hit, along with
your trachea, which means blood is flying all over the place and you're
going to suffocate from it if you don't do something smart (like
surrender, or run away).<br>
<br>
You start with a Suffocation 2. Every time you take an action with a
Speed greater than 0, its severity is increased by 1 (notably, the
&amp;quot;Move&amp;quot; action will not trigger this effect).
However, instead of making a Stamina 15 roll every time your
Suffocation increases (as you would with a normal Suffocation status),
you make such a roll every 10 IC. This follows all other normal rules
for Suffocation.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you suffer a Bleed status with severity equal to that of
the Suffocation. In the case of special abilities which reduce the
effect of the Suffocation status on you, the Bleed's severity is
determined before they're applied.<br>
<br>
Treatment with a First Aid kit will set the Suffocation penalty to 0;
however, this will not prevent it from increasing again. In fact,
nothing will at all until you've recovered from the wound! Ouch. On the
bright side, you're a super-implausible magic ninja. If you carefully
apply pressure to your neck with both hands, you can temporarily
suspend both the Suffocation rolls and the Bleed damage--though you may
take no other actions while doing this, not even Speed 0 ones. This
'suspension' applies after you've been doing it for at least 10
consecutive IC.<br>
<br>
This is really just nasty business, all things considered. It won't
start healing until it's received some medical treatment; after that,
as long as you keep your neck bandaged and let yourself rest, it'll
take twenty-six weeks to heal. Time to spend in a hospital counts
double for this purpose.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Injured Spine (Torso)<br>
In simple terms, your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous
system and relays signals from the body to the brain, and vice
versa.&nbsp; It also has several neural circuits which control
numerous reflexes and &amp;quot;instinctual&amp;quot; actions
that ninja tend to train themselves for (like moving out of the way of
the technique that caused this). <br>
<br>
Fortunately for you, your reflexes didn't seem to be that crucial
anyway, since you let this happen, so you probably aren't that bad
off.&nbsp; Well, that's a lie.&nbsp; Whenever you take an
action with a Speed greater than (RES)/10, two things happen.<br>
<br>
The first is that you suffer a Stun of half its Speed. The second is
that you acquire a Paralysis 1 status, or increase your existing
Paralysis from this wound by 1. The Paralysis lasts until the end of
the battle.<br>
<br>
This will not heal without medical treatement.&nbsp; It will take
thirteen weeks of medical treatment to recover from this.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Disemboweled (Abdomen)<br>
Congratulations, you've got what is potentially the most terible injury
one can receive.&nbsp; Your abdomen is full of all kinds of squishy
organs and things which, as it turns out, are pretty important to keep
you alive.&nbsp; Now there's a giant cut across your midriff and
they're all trying to sag out of your body.<br>
<br>
Your Fatigue penalties are doubled (-2 to Accuracy and -4 to defensive
rolls per level), but the bonuses are not. Any jutsu with an Upkeep
cannot be used, as it's impossible to maintain the necessary level of
focus.<br>
<br>
Until you've received treatment for this, any called shots to your
abdomen automatically deal their damage to your Hit Points.<br>
<br>
It takes a total of twenty-four weeks of rest to recover from this.
Every time you advance a Fatigue level after receiving this wound, it
takes another week to recover from. The wound won't even begin to heal
until you've received some form of medical treatment (be it from a
first aid kit or a week in the hospital). Weeks in the hospital count
double towards your recovery.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Avulsed Arm (Arm)<br>
Something just cut through a good portion of your arm.&nbsp; It's
still connected, but it's kind of flopping, and you can't really
control it, and it's kind of bleeding everywhere, and.. Yeah.<br>
<br>
Firstly, the arm is useless, which means you can't hold weapons (any
you are, drop), make handseals, use items and so forth.&nbsp; You
have a Bleed 6, -8 to Accuracy, and -4 to defensive rolls.&nbsp;
Every time you perform an attack which deals damage, your Bleed status
from this wound increases by your DB/5, to a minimum of 1--if it's down
to 0, then you acquire a brand new one!<br>
<br>
The arm will heal on its own so long as you keep it placed properly
(any first aid kit will do for this) in a sling, reducing the penalty
to Acuracy and defensive rolls by 1 per five weeks, with time in a
hospital counting double. Once those penalties are gone entirely, you
will stop incurring Bleed effects when you attack. <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Achilles Tendon Cut (Leg)<br>
Named after a mythic, nigh-invincible man who supposedly had a single
tendon as his weak spot.&nbsp; As it turns out, that's actually a
weak spot of everybody, and yours just got cut.<br>
<br>
The pain isn't quite as bad as the sight of your foot dragging along
unresponsively.&nbsp; For starters, you're unable to really stand
properly, so you take a -8 to your Dodge rolls, and a -4 to Accuracy
and Athletics.<br>
<br>
The worst part is that you really just can't move.&nbsp; You can't
move as part of an attack or use jutsu that affect movement (like
Shunshin).&nbsp; You can still take a move action, but at that
point you're moreso just rolling and crawling, so the total distance
moved is divided by 4, after all other factors are applied to
it.&nbsp; You can still 'move' to get out of the way of Area of
Effect attacks, but it suffers the same /4 as regular movement.<br>
<br>
This simply won't heal without medical attention.&nbsp; With it,
you reduce the Dodge penalty every two weeks and the Accuracy and
penalty to d20 rolls every four weeks.&nbsp; Additionally, after
eight weeks the penalty to movement becomes /2. After the the full
sixteen week recovery time has passed, the movement penalty goes
away.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Piercing (Minor)<br>
For every Minor piercing wound you're suffering from, you reduce your
current an maximum action Points by 2, to a minimum of 0. This stacks
addiively with all other AP reductions, including multiples of the same
wounds.<br>
<br>
Even if a minor wound has a timed effect, the AP reduction portion of
the wound lasts until the end of the battle. Wounds that are healed
mid-battle similarly have their AP reduction removed (and it is
possible to heal a Minor wound whose main effect has ended, but AP
reduction remains).<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 30) Needling (Torso)<br>
You've got a small but fairly deep incision from what struck
you.&nbsp; The initial shock of pain was worse than the wound
really is, though.&nbsp; You take a Stun 3, which increases by 1
for every time you take this wound in the same battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (31 - 60) Flesh Wound (Abdomen)<br>
You've been shanked in the gut.&nbsp; It managed to miss your
vitals, but it's still going to cause blood to trickle out of
you.&nbsp; You take a -1 to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Reflexive Flinch (Arm)<br>
The back of your hand was hit, causing your fingers to spasm
momentarily.&nbsp; Any weapons you're holding are dropped, and any
seals you're forming are automatically aborted.&nbsp; You take a -1
to Accuracy for the next 50 IC.<br>
<br>
Repeatedly applications of this wound do not stack the penalty to
Accuracy, but instead add 50 IC to its duration (or, if it has expired,
re-apply it).<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Muscle Stab (Leg)<br>
They struck your quadricep, which is a fairly easy target, all things
considered.&nbsp; If you spent the IC before you received this
wound moving, you are inflicted with a Stun 8; whether you were moving
or not, though, you have a -1 to Defensive rolls for the next 50 IC.<br>
<br>
Repeated applications of this wound do not stack the penalty to
defensive rolls, but instead add 50 IC to its duration (or, if it has
expired, re-apply it).&lt;/text&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
### Piercing (Major)<br>
Every Major Piercing wound you're suffering from reduces your current
and maximum AP by 4. This stacks additively with all other AP
reductions, including multiples of the same wounds.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 30) Punctured Cavity (Torso)<br>
The body has several cavities, areas where spcific internal organs are
house and kept together.&nbsp; One of them has been pierced and now
has a hole in it, which is filling up with blood.<br>
<br>
It's painful to move, or do basic things like breathe.&nbsp; You
have a penalty to Fatigue and d20 rolls equal to the number of Torso
wounds you have, including this one, up to a maximum of -4.<br>
<br>
Multiple instances of this wound count towards raising the penalty, and
all lower your AP normally, but their penalties don't stack--that is,
if you had five Punctured Cavities, your total penalty would be -4, not
-20.<br>
<br>
It takes four weeks to recover from, two with medical attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (31 - 60) Organ Hemmorrhage (Abdomen)<br>
Your abdomen happens to have several internal organs all closely packed
together.&nbsp; While space-saving, it also happens to mean that if
you're hit there, one of them is bound to be injured in some form or
fashion, and that's exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
What that boils down to is that you're bleeding, a lot. You take a -1
penalty to Accuracy and defensive rolls, and any time you take an
action (including defensive ones) with a Speed higher than your current
AP, this wound's penalty increases by 1, to a maximum of -4.<br>
<br>
Repeated applications of this wound raise the penalties by 1 each,
though still not above -4. These penalties last until the wound has
healed.<br>
<br>
This takes two weeks to recover from, only one with medical treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Joint Pierced (Arm)<br>
One of your arm's joints has been struck and is now filling with blood
and becoming inflamed. It makes it much harder to properly manipulate
the appendage, on top of the very strange and unnerving sensation you
get when you move the arm and can feel the collected blood sloshing
around.<br>
<br>
The base speed of all your attacks is increased by 2, and the effective
speed for determining their damage is decreased by 2. Thus, a basic
unarmed attack would be changed from Speed 8 to Speed 10, but deal
damage as if it was Speed 6.<br>
<br>
The increase and decrease cannot exceed 50% of an action's base speed.
For example, after 20 separate applications of this wound your basic
unarmed attack would be Speed 12, and deal damage as if it was Speed 4.
You may still use AP to reduce these actions to half their new base
speed.<br>
<br>
It takes three weeks to recover, only one with medical treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Joint Pierced (Leg)<br>
Though they missed fracturing your knee cap, they still managed to
pierce the joint itself, and it's not collecting (and leaking) blood
which isn't supposed to be there.&nbsp; Like many wounds, on its
own it isn't so bad, but when aggravated, it becomes very problematic.<br>
<br>
For every yard you move, including as part of an attack or with the aid
of a jutsu, your movement speed afterwards is decreases by 1%, to a
maximum of a 50% reduction. Multiple applications of this wound do not
increase its maximum reduction; however, if you had two instances of it
your speed would be reduced by 2% for every yard you moved thereafter,
and so forth.<br>
<br>
Finally, this applies a -1 penalty to defensive rolls for every 15% it
reduces your movement speed.<br>
<br>
It takes two weeks to recover on its own, only one with medical
treatment.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Piercing (Severe)<br>
Every Severe Piercing wound you're suffering from reduces your current
and maximum AP by 6. This stacks additively with all other AP
reductions, including multiples of the same wounds.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 30) Rib Spearing (Torso)<br>
The object that struck you did so in such a way as to cause your ribs
not just to fracture, but to split entirely.&nbsp; Both ends are
curved inward, making movement, breathing, and life in general very
painful.<br>
<br>
You take a -2 to Accuracy, Fatigue, and d20 rolls just for having your
ribs broken.&nbsp; Additionally, every time you advance a fatigue
category, or spend Willpower, you take the Minor Piercing wound
Needling, which stacks cumulatively with any other Needling wounds
taken in the fight, for determining the severity of its stun.<br>
<br>
This takes ten weeks to recover from, five with medical attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (31 - 60) Cavitation (Abdomen)<br>
Cavitation is an interesting phenomen typically only created by high
velocity projectiles.&nbsp; Ninja being ninja, of course, means
that this could happen with even the most inconspicuous of objects.<br>
<br>
What Cavitation is, is basically a wave of pressure that forces
things--in your case, your internal organs--to shift in location,
causing a cavity where there was none.&nbsp; It results in your
organs being crushed, missshapen, tearing, and dislocated.&nbsp;
This is especially problematic for the abdomen, wherein everything is
already densely packed.&nbsp; There is, shall we say, a space issue.<br>
<br>
The end result is that you automatically advance a fatigue category,
and the category at which you fall unconscious is reduced by one (from
six to five, normally, meaning if you fail a fatigue roll at fatigue 4,
you fall unconscious).<br>
<br>
The only good part about this injury is that once your organs are
displaced--well, they're displaced.&nbsp; If you are already
suffering from this injury and are unlucky enough to have it happen
again, you advance a fatigue category, but the category for
unconsciousness is not lowered more than once, regardless of how many
times you suffer this wound.<br>
<br>
This takes twelve weeks to recover from on your own, six with medical
treatment.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Tricep Tear (Arm)<br>
They missed your humerus bone, but managed to pierce right through the
tendon that connected a portion of your tricep to it.&nbsp; As any
medically-savvy ninja knows, your tricep is pretty vital for doing
things like punching, and holding objects.<br>
<br>
If you're using a weapon, then your damage bonus is halved; unarmed
only has its damage bonus reduced by a fourth.&nbsp; You take a -3
to Accuracy, but against disarm attempts, this increases to -5 (whether
you try to parry or dodge it).<br>
<br>
Tendons are tricky business, and require medical expertise to
fix.&nbsp; Without medical attention, it won't heal; with it, it
takes six weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Hamstrung (Leg)<br>
Your hamstring, or some similarly important muscle in your leg, got cut
badly enough that it's not doing its job any more. You can stand,
barely, and you can balance, sort of.<br>
<br>
You can only accomplish 15 IC of movement before having to take a Rest
action. Movement as part of an attack counts towards this limit. Any
effects which require you to channel chakra through your legs (such as
standing on walls or water, or jutsu such as Mizutamari) end, and
cannot be used until you've healed.<br>
<br>
Speaking of which, healing takes a while; twelve weeks of
rest.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
### Piercing (Critical)<br>
Every Critical Piercing wound you're suffering from reduces your
current and maximum AP by 8. This stacks additively with all other AP
reductions, including multiples of the same wounds.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 30) Torso: Punctured Lung<br>
Okay, so, first off, calm down. It's not as bad as it... okay, yeah,
it's as bad as it sounds. The good news is, it's not actually lethal.
You've still got the other one (...right?) and whatever did this to you
probably ventilated the lung, and by extension, the inside of your
chest--no air building up in your chest cavity to collapse the other
lung.<br>
<br>
...Ready for the bad news? Yeah, lungs aren't actually meant to get
ventilated. You have difficulty breathing, for one thing. In fact, you
can't actually breathe normally, because there's an extra hole in your
lung. Still, you're a super awesome ninja, and as long as you have one
hand free to cover the wound up, you can still breathe.<br>
<br>
You can't take Rest actions, and the final results of your Stamina
rolls are halved. As in, if you have a 12+5+15 = 32, that's actually a
16. Probably less brutal, you have a -5 penalty to your Accuracy and
d20 rolls from the agonizing pain, and a -5 penalty to Chakra
Exhaustion rolls due to general poor physical condition. Moving any
distance forces a roll of Stamina 10, +1 per yard moved; this even
applies when moving as part of an attack or with the aid of a jutsu.
This can be avoided by moving at one tenth your normal movement speed.<br>
<br>
The 'agonizing pain' bit goes away in a month (or, more likely, you get
used to it). It takes three months of medical treatment to recover from
the effects. Once it's done, you're good as new.<br>
<br>
Oh, unless you get your second lung punctured before the first one's
healed. Then you just die after 50 IC have passed. Sucks to be to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (31 - 60) Abdomen: Pierced Liver<br>
You're bleeding from the midsection. And, the blood is black. Every
ninja knows at least a little about anatomy, first aid, and injuries,
and everyone ninja knows what black blood means: you're bleeding from
the liver and about to die.<br>
<br>
This inflicts you with a Poison 1 effect. 20 IC later, it becomes
Poison 2; another 20 IC, and it becomes Poison 3. This continues, all
the way up to Poison 10. It doesn't end.<br>
<br>
If treated with First Aid, make a Medicine check. Its effects will be
held at bay for 1 hour per point you get on your skill roll. Once
you've received a week of medical treatment, this stops being necessary.<br>
<br>
However, any time you advance a Fatigue level you have an 80% chance of
reopening the wound. This goes down by 10% for every month (4 OOC days)
that pass without it courring.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Arm: Shoulder Orifice<br>
Someone has created another orifice in your body.&nbsp; As in--if
there wasn't blood pouring out from both ends--someone could look right
through your shoulder and see what's out the other side.&nbsp; In
Pain is an understatement.<br>
<br>
On top of that, your arm is pretty much worthless.&nbsp; It's still
there, muscular (or toned, for the ladies!) and attached and awesome,
but it's not doing anything but helping to keep your clothing on, at
this point.&nbsp; You're not really able to feel anything that the
arm or hand happens to touch, and the only way you get it to do so is
by flopping it against something as dead weight.<br>
<br>
You lose the usage of your arm.&nbsp; If you don't have
single-handed seals, you can not make seals anymore. You have a -6
Accuracy penalty, can't use two-handed weapons, and when you
multi-throw the total number of weapons you can throw is halved.<br>
<br>
When you're first hit, this inflicts a Bleed 15 which will go away
normally.<br>
<br>
This won't even begin healing until you've had four weeks of medical
treatment. After that, it'll take another six weeks of medical
treatment, or twice as long resting the arm (you may fight and such, as
long as you don't use that arm) for it to heal fully.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Leg:&nbsp; Penetrated Artery<br>
Your femoral artery has been hit, and blood is literally spraying out
of you into the air. Aside from the general pain involved and the fact
that it's completely disgusting, you're losing a potentially fatal
amount of blood and if it isn't stopped--no, a hand and some pressure
won't stop this--you're going to die.<br>
<br>
Your maximum Vitality is reduced by 10%. Every time you take an action,
your current and maximum Vitality are reduced by (that action's base
Speed)*2; every time you spend AP, your current and maximum Vitality
are reduced by (AP spent).<br>
<br>
If you have 0 Vitality remaining, your current HP, maximum HP, and
maximum Vitality are all reduced by that amount. This includes move
actions, unless you move at only one tenth your normal speed. If your
maximum Hit Points are reduced to 0, you die.<br>
<br>
Recovery takes sixteen weeks. At that point, you begin regaining lost
maximum HP and Vitality. Every week which passes you regain (RES)/3 max
HP, or (RES)/2 with medical attention. Once your max HP is fully
restored, you begin gaining lost maximum Vitality at the same
rate.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
### Energy (Minor)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Sun Spots (Head)<br>
You were a little too slow in closing your eyes when hit, and now vague
shapes resembling the oncoming blast seem to float around in front of
you, obscuring your vision.&nbsp; It's annoying, more than anything
else. You have a -4 Visibility Penalty, which fades at a rate of 1 per
10 IC.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Flash Fever&nbsp; (Torso)<br>
The center of your body was hit, which is good, since it's intended to
take the brunt of attacks.&nbsp; But whatever hit you also managed
to heat you up so much that your body is having trouble regulating your
temperature. You feel vaguely sick and tired, but you'll shake it off
soon.&nbsp; You have a -2 to Fatigue rolls until the end of battle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Stomach Blister (Abdomen)<br>
A pretty nasty blister managed to emerge from whatever hit you, causing
plasma to be stuck within a layer of skin that expanded.&nbsp;
It's.. gross, and fairly uncomfortable.&nbsp; You have a -1
Immobilization penalty until the end of the fight, unless you decide to
pop the blister as a Speed 8 action (Seriously--ew), taking a fourth of
the damage that caused this injury again.&nbsp; This additional
damage can't cause a wound itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Burned (Arm)<br>
You've been burned!&nbsp; It hurts.&nbsp; The skin is red and
starting to swell a little, and touching it (or having it touched)
tends to hurt, as it's now raw.&nbsp; This inflicts a Burn 3, and
you suffer a -2 to Accuracy until it goes away due to the pain involved
with using the affected limb.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Burned (Leg)<br>
You've been burned!&nbsp; Seriously, it does hurt.&nbsp; Your
leg is red and it's painful when you put your weight on it trying to do
things like run.&nbsp; You're inflicted with a Burn 3, and take a
-2 to Dodges until it goes away due to the pain of using the afffected
limb.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
### Energy (Major)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Facial Burn (Head)<br>
There's now a nasty burn across your face, the flesh blistered and
somewhat charred. This is disorient, and you can't get the smell of
burnt flesh out of your nostrils, or the taste out of your mouth, when
you inhale, which has the effect of nauseating you whenever you try to
breathe deeply.<br>
<br>
As you exert yourself, you smell it more and more and become
progressively sicker.&nbsp; Every time you make a Stamina or Chakra
roll, you increase your penalty to both by 2.&nbsp; This takes a
month to heal on your own, or two weeks with medical treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Scorched Chest (Torso)<br>
The majority of your body has been burned, taking any hair found on
your chest, back, and stomach along with it.&nbsp; Due to the large
surface area that entails, it isn't that deep at any point, but since
it covers so much area, it makes it very easy for others to aggravate
your injury.<br>
<br>
You take an additional 10% damage when hit, after all normal reductions
but before determining if you suffer wounds.&nbsp; One of the worst
parts about it is how it tends to make getting additional wounds that
much easier.&nbsp; This takes two weeks to heal, only one with
medical attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Scalded Stomach (Abdomen)<br>
Whatever hit you managed to more or less burn away what covered your
midriff and had enough power behind it to significantly heat up your
internal organs. This is not good, as your organs can be pretty
sensitive about that kind of thing.<br>
<br>
You are afflicted with a Stun 8, and have your current and maximum Hit
Points and Vitality reduced by your RES until this has healed, which
takes three weeks with or without medical treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (61 - 80) Second Degree Burn (Arm)<br>
The majority of your arm is burned.&nbsp; While not
life-threatening, the amount of skin that's been burned is substantial,
making it a great deal more painful to use the arm in battle.<br>
<br>
When you perform handseals, attack or parry, you take twice the base
Speed of the action as damage.&nbsp; In addition, you have a -2 to
Accuracy.&nbsp; This takes 5 weeks to heal on its own, 3 with
medical treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Second Degree Burn (Leg)<br>
One of your legs has been burned down to the dermis, the layer beneath
the epidermis, causing multiple small blisters to form at the surface,
which has reddened and toughened considerably.<br>
<br>
You have a -5 Immobilization penalty, along with a Burn 3.&nbsp;
When the Burn status is removed, the Immobilization penalty is reduced
to 3.&nbsp; It takes two weeks per Immobilization penalty on its
own, one week with medical treatment.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
### Energy (Severe)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Blinded (Head)<br>
Your kept your eyes open a little too long when something was aimed
right at your face.&nbsp; Just like with it being a bad idea to
look directly into the sun, it is also a bad plan to stare directly at
a superheated jutsu aimed at your head.&nbsp; Your face as a whole
was scalded, but your eyes took the worst of it by looking at it for so
long.<br>
<br>
You take a -3 Visibility Penalty, which is reduced by 1 every 10 IC,
and a Stun 3.&nbsp; It is not so bad by itself, until the next time
you're hit by a jutsu that inflicts Energy wounds (regardless of
whether or not it does, in fact, actually wound you).<br>
<br>
When that happens, your visibility penalty is increased by 1 per rank
of the jutsu (1 for E, 3 for C, etc.), to a maximum of -8. The
technique must deal damage to trigger this effect of the wound.<br>
<br>
It takes a long time for your eyes to not be so sensitive, reducing the
penalty you incur when blinded by 1 every four weeks--for a total of a
20 week recovery time, to not be blinded by A-rank jutsu. With medical
attention, the recovery time is halved.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Dark Halo (Torso)<br>
The name comes from the fact that you've suffered burns of the entire
dermis in a solid, unbroken ring around your body.&nbsp; It is not
quite as cool as it sounds--burns of such magnitude can actually cut
off circulation to the rest of the body.<br>
<br>
In short, you're going into shock.&nbsp; At the start, it is not so
bad, reducing the bonus to CE/Stm rolls from Fatigue by 1 (from +5 to
+4).&nbsp; Every time your Fatigue increases, however, the bonus
lowers by one per level. Thus, if you were at Fatigue 3 when you
received this wound, then went up to Fatigue 5 in the same battle,
you'd have only +2 to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls per Fatigue
category (for a total of +3).<br>
<br>
Your Fatigue bonus 'recovers' at the rate of +1 per three weeks of
rest. After this, it will take six more weeks, halved with medical
treatment, to fully recover from the wound--meaning that the bonus
could still be lowered in that time. If this occurs, you have to
re-recover from the lost Fatigue bonus, and then you'll pick up where
you left off on healing the rest of the wound.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (41 - 60) Side Burns (Abdomen)<br>
The sides of your ribcage have been charred and are almost black, hence
the name that resembles a much less gruesome-looking hairstyle (though,
let's be honest, it's still pretty bad).&nbsp; Aside from making
the definition of your ribcage more obvious, it also makes it harder to
breathe.<br>
<br>
It isn't so bad here and there, but that quick, almost gasping inhale
taken when you try to spur yourself onward makes you pause and lose
your breath, slowing you down when you want to be at your quickest.<br>
<br>
Whenever you spend AP in combat, you must first pay an additional
amount AP equal to your current Fatigue level, +1. This surcharge does
not affect the action's Speed, pay any costs associate with it, or
otherwise count in any beneficial manner. It does, however, count
againt any penalties or limitations regarding spending AP you may have.<br>
<br>
Every time you spend more than your current Willpower in AP on an
action (including the surcharge from this wound), you are afflicted
with a Suffocation 1.&nbsp; This Suffocation penalty persists for
the duration of the fight, but resets to 0 after combat.<br>
<br>
The burns are slow to heal, taking sixteen weeks on your own, or eight
weeks with medical attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; (61 - 80) Muscle Melting (Arms)<br>
Not quite as literal as the name implies, but no less serious an
injury--you've been burned so deep that he muscle itself has been
affected.&nbsp; Aside from intense pain, it also weakens the muscle
as a substantial section of it has become damaged and useless.<br>
<br>
Your damage bonuses (Physical and Ninjutsu) are lowered by 25%, and you
have a -1 penalty to Accuracy.&nbsp; As you continually use the
muscles and chakra involved, the heat builds and spreads to worsen the
injury, inflicting even more damage to both muscles and tenketsu.<br>
<br>
Whenever you deal damage, the Damage Bonus which was used is lowered by
5%, to a minimum of 50% (halving your damage bonus).&nbsp; When
either reaches 50%, your Accuracy is lowered by an additional 1 point,
to a maximum of -5.<br>
<br>
But despite the wound, a ninja's body is an amazing machine.&nbsp;
Every two weeks, you recover 5% of each damage bonus.&nbsp; With
medical attention, you recover that every week.&nbsp; Once both of
your damage bonuses are back to normal, the Accuracy penalty goes away,
and your bonuses stop decreasing when being used.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Fused Foot (Leg)<br>
The skin of one of your feet (odds right, evens left) has been burned
so badly that the toes are more or less a singular section, melted
together.&nbsp; The rest of it isn't much better, but the most
pressing issue how it impairs its functions in battle.<br>
<br>
You have a -5 to dodges due to how hard it is to adequately shift your
weight and pivot using that leg now.&nbsp; It actually makes
turning into and away from blows more difficult, imposing a -2 penalty
to Parries.&nbsp; This also makes it substantially harder to run
effectively, causing you to lose the benefits of any effects which
increase your AGI for the sole purpose of movement (such as the Runner
ability, or Racing Thunder Technique), and halving your movement speed
on top of that.<br>
<br>
How you're going to fix it medically is another matter altogether, one
which is very unpleasant to hear about and even worse to
experience.&nbsp; Safe to say you should want medical attention for
it, to recover from it after seven weeks.&nbsp; But if you're crazy
(and have a first aid kit to use), you can go without it, though it
takes fourteen weeks to do so.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
### Energy (Critical)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 - 20) Eye Welded Shut (Head)<br>
You got hit in the face by a giant fireball of bolt of lightning, which
is basically awful for tons of reasons. Aside from the deep-tissue
burns across half your face, the heat was enough to melt the surface of
one of your eyelids, fusing it shut.<br>
<br>
Any ranks in the Enhanced Sight are lost until you recover, as are any
abilities dependant upon it.&nbsp; That eye is effectively useless,
putting you at a -3 visibility penalty as well.<br>
<br>
It gets worse. The movements of your eyes are linked; where one goes,
the other follows, meaning that while one of your eyes is slightly
damage and basically glued by molten flesh to your eyelid, it's still
trying to move around, aggravating the injury further.<br>
<br>
Every 10 IC which pass, you suffer a -1 penalty to Accuracy, Fatigue
rolls, and defensive rolls, with a maximum of -10. However, if you
close both your eyes this penalty these penalties are reduced by 1
every 20 IC (though be aware that closing both eyes incurs a -10
visibility penalty), to a minimum of half the highest value it's
reached (if it got up to -7, closing your eyes couldn't reduced it
below -4).<br>
<br>
This heals naturally, with the penalty to Accuracy, et cetra, being
lowered by 1 for every 4 weeks that go without it being increased. Once
it's been reduced to 0, it takes ten more weeks to recover. If the
Accuracy/etc penalty returns during that time, healing your eye is
interrupted (with 'progress' retained) until it's back to 0. At this
point you stop suffering this wound's effects, but have a
semi-permanent -2 visibility penalty.<br>
<br>
Medical treatment halves all the above times. After another five weeks
spent hospitalized, the 'permanent' -2 visibility penalty will also be
removed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (21 - 40) Atrial Fibrillation (Torso)<br>
The burns to your chest are so deep and severe that they're affecting
your cardiovascular system.&nbsp; Specifically, the heart, and the
rhythm at which it beats.&nbsp; Thankfully, this is the less lethal
form of fribrillation, as it means your heart is still able to beat
properly and pump blood throughout the body, it just does so
irregularly.<br>
<br>
But it's still pretty bad, as things like fighting cause your pulse to
shoot way up, which increases the workload of your heart and makes it
more likely and devastating every time your heart skips a
beat.&nbsp; Every 15 IC, you take a -1 to Accuracy, d20 rolls, and
Defensive rolls.&nbsp; This penalty can be reduced by 1 by taking a
Rest action, but if it does then you do not lower your Stamina penalty,
as is normal.<br>
<br>
But the more you fight, the worse it gets, and there is only so much
even a ninja can do to support themselves while their heart isn't
working properly.&nbsp; This penalty can only be reduced to half
its highest amount reached (if it becomes a -5 to Accuracy, d20 rolls
and Defensive rolls, you can only reduce it by Resting to -3).<br>
<br>
This penalty does not increase outside of combat, but will continue to
affect you every time you fight.&nbsp; One of the worst problems
with this injury is how it is a chronic condition that the body can't
fix by itself, once it's happened.&nbsp; You must receive medical
attention to get it fixed, and with it, takes 7 weeks to no longer
suffer penalties to d20 rolls.&nbsp; With another 7 weeks, you
don't take penalties to defensive rolls, and then with another 7 you
don't take penalties to Accuracy, and any penalty you still had is
removed.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ( 41 - 60 ) Slow Roasted (Abdomen)<br>
When something is cooked poorly, the outside tends to burn first, but
the inside is typically not that bad.&nbsp; But when something is
really charred, it is not just that the outside blackens and dies, but
it ends up encapsulating the interior, preventing the escape of heat.<br>
<br>
That's basically just what happened to you.&nbsp; So while your
skin is flaking from your stomache and looks absolutely horrifying
every time you breathe in and out, the real problem is how your innards
have been superheated and are unable to effectively cool off. The end
result is a constant feeling of sickness that seems impossible to treat.<br>
<br>
You automatically advance one Fatigue level. Penalties to your Stamina
and Chakra Exhaustions rolls are not reset to 0 when you advanced a
Fatigue level, and you advance an additional Fatigue category for every
10 points you fail a roll by, rather than every 15.<br>
<br>
You can still Rest, but it becomes a Speed 15 action, to which AP still
cannot be applied. Out of combat you recover Fatigue levels at the rate
of 1 per OOC day (rather than hour), and cannot recover below Fatigue
1. Similarly, you regain one point of Willpower each OOC day, rather
than all your Willpower each day.<br>
<br>
After twenty weeks of recovery, your Fatigue and Chakra Exhaustion
penalties reset normally, and you can recover down to Fatigue zero.
After another twenty weeks, your recovery times return to normall. It
is very, very difficult for your body to come back from this. Medical
attention halves these times.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ( 61 - 80 ) Red Right Hand (Arms)<br>
The name is something of a misnomer, actually--your hand is
black.&nbsp; You can't feel it, you can't use it.&nbsp; It's
still there, although it's hard to tell how much of it is salvagable at
a glance, because it's just that badly charred.<br>
<br>
You lose the usage of a hand.&nbsp; You can not make seals, hold
two-handed weapons and so forth. You take a -8 to Accuracy rolls, and a
-4 to Defensive rolls--Parrying suffers the penalty to Accuracy rolls,
not Defensive rolls, as is normal.<br>
<br>
Recovering from this is about as painful and drawn-out as you'd expect
from losing most of your hand.&nbsp; It takes thirty weeks on its
own, fifteen weeks with medical attention.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (81 - 100) Melted Leg (Legs)<br>
Your clothing and leg were both burnt so horridly that it's hard to
tell where one ends and the other begins. Much to your displeasure, you
can still feel the limb--or, rather, the mass of agonizing pain where
your functional leg used to be. When you move, bits of black flake
off--probably best not to think about whether or not that's clothing or
flesh.<br>
<br>
This reduces Agility for by 75% the purposes of movement, and prevents
you from using movement-enhancing jutsu such as Shunshin or Racing
Thunder Technique (the Doton Mud Wave Technique can still be used
normally, as it doesn't rely on actual use of your legs).<br>
<br>
Additionally, it's incredibly hard to get around with your leg in this
condition. You have a -8 penalty to dodges, and -4 to Accuracy and all
other d20 rolls. You can spend 1 Willpower to force yourself to move
despite the difficulty doing so. Doing so halves these penalties, and
the reduction to your agility, for the next 50 IC.<br>
<br>
On your own, this takes two weeks to heal for every 5% movement speed
reduction. Every 15% recovered also lowers the dodge penalty by 2, and
the penalties to other rolls by 1. Medical attention lets you recover
at twice that rate.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
# Recovery<br>
&gt;1. Hit Points and Vitality<br>
2. Fatigue<br>
3. Willpower<br>
4. Wounds<br>
5. Medical Attention<br>
6. Guidelines<br>
###### a. IC and OOC Recovery<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Rest<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Hit Points and Vitality<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Lost Vitality recovers fairly quickly; ninja don't get too far through
their training without being able to get back on their feet. You
recover 10% of your maximum Vitality every 10 minutes OOC.<br>
<br>
Lost Hit Points are harder to deal with. By the time you're taking HP
damage, your body's already reached its limit as far as soaking damage
goes. You recovery 10% of your max HP every 1 hour OOC.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Fatigue<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Fatigue is more than just being a little winded; it's exhaustion and
bone-deep weariness. Ninja are just much better able to deal with such
things than normal people. Every hour that passes OOC, your Fatigue is
lowered by one level.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Willpower<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
You begin every (OOC) day with your full amount of Willpower. With the
exception of some rare effects, you can't get Willpower back any faster
than that.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Wounds<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Wounds are particularly grievous injuries, ones powerful enough to have
effects beyond just beating you that much closer to unconsciousness.
The rules for what causes Wounds are discussed in the appropriate
section of the combat chapter.<br>
<br>
And, so are their recovery times! How long a given wound takes to heal
will be listed in that wound's own description. Those are, unless
specified otherwise, base times, and can be reduced by medical
attention (as described below).<br>
<br>
Minor wounds all heal at the same rate, with or without rest or medical
attention. Most wounds will heal even if you're not getting rest, with
details listed for each individual wound; if it says nothing on the
matter, rest or lack thereof won't change its recovery time.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Medical Attention<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
All the listed recovery times assume you're waiting to get better on
your own; ninja have a remarkable ability to recover from injuries,
full as they are of vim and vigor.<br>
<br>
Naturally, you heal faster when you're actually getting rest and have
trained medical professionals looking after you. In fact, you regain
everything except Willpower twice as fast when receiving medical
attention.<br>
<br>
...Which brings us to what 'medical attention' means. It means you are
in a hospital, or getting an equivalent amount of bed rest, with one or
more doctors or medics checking up on you regularly. You are getting
sleep and being taken care of, not training or researching a new jutsu.
You can most likely have visitors.<br>
<br>
Every ninja village's hospital is always open to its shinobi. That
said, if you try to check yourself in because you have no vitality and
half your HP, and want to spar your friend again that afternoon, you
will promptly get kicked out. On the other hand, if you're beaten to a
pulp (unconscious at 0 HP) or severely injured (you have a Wound of
Major or greater) you can check yourself in.<br>
<br>
However, once you've gone to a hospital they won't let you leave for 24
OOC hours, unless it's on important business--such as being required
for a mission your village is sending you on. The doctors have gotten
very good at seeing through people's excuses.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
6. Guidelines<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Sometimes people get silly ideas and have to be corrected. This is to
hopefully preempt that, by clarifying a few things! You probably don't
need to read anything in this section unless it actually comes up
during gameplay.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; IC and OOC
Recovery<br>
What happens if you're IC and need to know how fast you heal? For
example, if you're on a mission, or trying to buy time between fights.
If it takes ten minutes to RP a conversation, have you healed in that
time? What about if you need to step away from your computer for an
hour to do laundry, but there's someone who just drew a knife on you?<br>
<br>
For the most part, this really doesn't matter; you can assume OOC
healing times apply unless it actually is an important situation.<br>
<br>
Should such a situation (that is, an important one, or a GM-run event),
use the following in-character times:<br>
10% Vitality: 1 hour<br>
10% HP: 6 hours<br>
1 Fatigue level: 6 hours<br>
Willpower: Restored fully after six consecutive hours of restful sleep.<br>
Wounds: 1 OOC day = 1 IC week<br>
<br>
Medical attention does halve those times.<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Rest<br>
Your body can't heal when you're putting too much stress on it. It's
why doctors recommend bed rest (and lots of fluids, and
&amp;quot;grape&amp;quot; flavored medicine that tastes just
horrid, and nothing like grapes).<br>
<br>
'Rest' for a ninja, however, does not entail laying in bed for the
afternoon. Taking damage, or failing a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion
roll, interrupts your healing; this applies to Vitality, HP, and
Stamina. So, if you had been recovering from 0 Vitality, Fatigue 3, and
full HP for an hour and fifteen minutes, then did something to exert
yourself and failed a Stamina roll, you'd have recovered 70% of your
maximum Vitality (75 minutes, /10 = 7) and 1 Fatigue level, putting you
at Fatigue 2--except you just failed that roll, so back to Fatigue 3
you go.<br>
<br>
That doesn't apply to Wounds (unless specified otherwise) or Willpower.
If your healing of a Wound is interrupted (usually by a method
mentioned in that Wound's description), you still keep however many
days of progress you've made towards recovering from it--you just don't
get to count the current day.<br>
<br>
If, for some reason, you are suffering from starvation, dehydration, or
sleep deprivation (less than 6 hours of restful sleep a night), all of
your healing times, including Willpower, are doubled. For wounds, this
means that every 2 consecutive days of healing count as only 1 (in case
you, before having fully recovered, return to sleeping/eating/drinking
and are able to resume healing at the normal rate).<br>
<br>
\page<br>
# Skills<br>
<br>
Skills represent broad, generic things ninja do, and how well your
character can do them. Unlike abilities or jutsu, the exact method of
performing a skill is ambiguous; you might use stealth by hiding in
foliage, or by camouflaging yourself, but in game terms it's all about
the same.<br>
<br>
Your skills all have a limit of 5 +(your total XP)/200 ranks. A lot of
them benefit from practical application and general worldliness.
Actually increasing your skills up to that limit, however, requires you
to spend skill points.<br>
<br>
You get 1 Skill Point for every 25 XP you gain; this happens
automatically, for free, and you cannot buy more skill points. A single
skill point raises a single skill by one rank. Clanless characters gain
1 skill point for every 20 XP instead.<br>
<br>
For example, if you had 600 XP you would have a total of (600 /25 =) 24
skill points, and you could raise any of your skills up to rank (5 +
600/200 = ) 8. You could use this to raise your Stealth to rank 8, your
Awareness to 4, Chakra Control to 6, Resistance to 5, and Survival to 1
(8 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 1 = 24).<br>
<br>
A skill roll is 1d20 + (your ranks in the skill). Even if you haven't
raised a skill beyond zero, you may still make a plain 1d20 roll when
attempting to perform a task that would call for that skill.<br>
<br>
Some skills are labeled &amp;quot;Trained&amp;quot;, which
means you cannot make any roll at all unless you have at least 1 rank
in them. These are generally skills which represent knowledge you have
to learn, instead of something that can be attempted
intuitively.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Athletics<br>
You use athletics when you perform acrobatics, leap across a chasm, try
to navigate difficult terrain, weave your way between traps, swim
across a river, or so forth. You can flip, tumble, and keep your
balance under difficult circumstances.<br>
<br>
### Awareness<br>
How perceptive you are. This applies to things like hearing a faint
noise, noticing that you're being followed, spying on a single
conversation in a crowded room, and finding an enemy hiding from you in
combat.<br>
<br>
### Chakra Control<br>
This is your ability to control the flow of the chakra within your own
body, using it efficiently and shaping it precisely to do what you
want. To a limited extent, it also represents how intuitively aware you
are of the nature of chakra in general, and might allow you to notice
when something's unusual about the surrounding chakra.<br>
<br>
### Espionage<br>
Something of a catch-all skill, this includes most things shady and
underhanded. Pickpocketing, lock-picking, setting and disarming (or
sabotaging) traps, forging documents, sleight of hand, and disguising
yourself all fall under the umbrella of espionage.<br>
<br>
### Medicine (Trained)<br>
You have knowledge of the human body and how it works. This includes
biology, first aid, and at higher levels actual medical procedures and
requirements. With a few ranks, you can probably apply a tourniquet;
with enough, you might even deserve a 'Doctor' in front of your name
(but good luck actually getting any respect!).<br>
<br>
### Research (Trained)<br>
Book smarts, overall knowledge, and an ability to gather information.
Research can be used to solve complicated code and ciphers, find
information in a library, and get up to date on the latest gossip when
in a new town.<br>
<br>
### Resistance<br>
Not to be confused with resilience, this is how well your body is able
to fend off the ravages of the environment and all sorts of
unpleasantness that might befall it, from blistering heat to poison to
burns. This is primarily useful for fighting off unpleasant status
effects that may afflict you, both in combat and out.<br>
<br>
### Stealth<br>
How well you can sneak around, keep out of view, and not be obnoxiously
loud. Whenever you need to be unobtrusive, hide from enemies, or move
from point A to point B being noticed, stealth is your best friend. A
ninja who can't be stealthy probably won't get very far in their career
without some significant redeeming qualities.<br>
<br>
### Survival<br>
This lets you forage for food and move easily through hostile
environments. While resistance might keep sunburn at bay while stranded
in the desert, survival will help you find the nearest oasis and make
an umbrella out of palm fronds. It's also used to track people and
animals, and avoid being tracked.<br>
<br>
### Toxicology (Trained)<br>
This represents overall familiarity with poisons. While high enough
medicine might be able to identify a poison, its symptoms, and how to
treat it, toxicology knows what plant or animal that poison comes from,
how long it takes for effects to set in, and just how deadly it can be.
Many medics have enough of this skill to be helpful in their work...
but it's also very handy if you find yourself needing to poison someone.<br>

<br>
&gt;1. What Abilities Are<br>
2. Purchasing Abilities<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. What Abilities Are<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Abilities represent the fruits of your character's training, and the
ways in which they've developed as a shinobi. What abilities you take
will play a large role in shaping how you perform in combat and other
situations.<br>
<br>
Abilities are more specific than skills; they differ from jutsu in that
while a jutsu is a specific technique, any ability is a way of doing
something or a permanent increase in your capabilities.<br>
<br>
Most abilities are passive improvements, giving you new capabilities or
making you able to do a certain thing better. You may choose to 'not
use' a given ability at any time, essentially a form of holding back.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Purchasing Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Abilities are acquired by spending XP. Some abilities will list only a
&amp;quot;Cost&amp;quot;; for those abilities, you spend that
much XP and acquire the ability, and that is it.<br>
<br>
Others will list both a &amp;quot;Base Cost&amp;quot; and a
&amp;quot;Scale.&amp;quot; These abilities can be purchased
more than once. The first time, you pay the Base Cost in XP; each
future purchase has its cost increased by the Scale.<br>
<br>
For example, the Enhanced Hearing ability has Base Cost 4, Scale 3. One
rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost 4 XP. The second would cost (4+3) 7
XP, and the third would cost (4+3+3) 10 XP. So, the total XP spent to
get all three ranks would be (4 + 7 + 10) 21 XP.<br>
<br>
Abilities with more than one rank will also include a Limit entry. This
is what controls how many ranks of the ability you can have. So, if an
ability (such as Attentive) said &amp;quot;Research
/5&amp;quot; and you had 12 ranks of Research, you could buy that
ability twice.<br>
<br>
Many abilities will include in their limit line a maximum, such as
&amp;quot;Limit: CHA /10, max 4&amp;quot;. This means that you
may take that ability up to that many times (so in that example, 4).<br>
<br>
Certain abilities will also say &amp;quot;Requires:
(something)&amp;quot;. You cannot take any ranks in that ability
unless you meet the requirement.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

====================<br>
1. Vigor<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Brute Force =-<br>
You're good at... well, exactly what it sounds like: applying a lot of
force all at once. It might be sheer physical strength, or you could
just know how to strike properly. Each rank increases your physical
damage bonus by 0.2.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 1<br>
###### Scale: 1<br>
###### Limit: STR /10<br>
###### Requires: 80 STR<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Cadence =-<br>
Once you get into a good rhythm, you find it easier and easier to
maintain and keep building your&nbsp; momentum. All your Combo
jutsu have &amp;quot;-1 Stamina&amp;quot; added to their Combo
Counter line. This&nbsp; cannot reduce a technique's cost below
half its normal value.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 30<br>
###### Requires: +6 or higher bonus to Stamina rolls, without Fatigue
bonuses<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Endurance =-<br>
Your extensive physical conditioning has given you an almost
preternatural ability to shrug off damage. When you block, you may
choose to&nbsp; reduce the damage dealt by an additional 10% at the
first rank, or an additional 25% at the second rank. This may only be
done once every 30-(RES/10) IC.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 25<br>
###### Scale: 10<br>
###### Limit: 2<br>
###### Requires: 60 RES<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Fortitude =-<br>
Every rank of this ability gives you a +2 bonus to Resistance rolls
when you block an attack (even if you are doing so reflexively); if
you've declared that you're blocking, this also applies to any effects
requiring a Resistance roll which you wouldn't normally get to defend
against (such as the B-rank Poison Mist).<br>
<br>
If you've declared you're blocking for a certain time period, and take
another defense (for example: you are blocking from IC 20 to IC 30, and
on IC 24 you dodge an attack, and are hit) you still have half this
ability's normal bonus applied to your Resistance rolls.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 2<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: STR /20, max 5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Good Lungs =-<br>
All this ninja work has left you well beyond what peak physical
condition would be for an ordinary person. In addition to being able to
fight and exert yourself for abnormally long times, you recover from
such exertion almost supernaturally fast. When you use the Rest action
to lower your Stamina penalty, it's reduced by 1 more per rank (so at
two ranks, a Speed 5 Rest action would decrease your Stamina penalty by
3).<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 10<br>
###### Scale: 5<br>
###### Limit: RES /80<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Hard to Kill =-<br>
You prove distressingly difficult to make dead. Your max Vitality and
HP are increased by 10% per rank. However, Wounds are calculated off
your unmodified (&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;) maximums.<br>
<br>
For example, if you had 1000 Vitality and 3 ranks of Hard to Kill,
you'd have 1300 Vitality. However, your
&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; maximum would still be 1000, and
wounds would be determined based off what percent of 1000 Vitality
their damage was.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 6<br>
###### Scale: 1<br>
###### Limit: RES /20<br>
###### Requires: 80 RES<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Healthy =-<br>
You get plenty of exercise, and probably eat healthily. When your job
places serious physical demands upon you (such as leaping across chasms
and running over rooftops), this can be useful. You have a +1 bonus to
Stamina rolls per rank.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 6<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: Athletics /5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Power Attack =-<br>
You put extra force behind your unarmed strikes, turning your feeble
punches into fearsome punches! Or... something like that.<br>
<br>
Each rank allows you to increase the Stamina cost, and die size, of
your basic unarmed attack by 2. So at rank 1, you could deal 2d6 damage
for 7 Stamina; and at rank 4, you could deal 2d12 damage for 13 Stamina.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 4<br>
###### Scale: 4<br>
###### Limit: STR /20, max 4<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Resilient =-<br>
You're harder to hurt than you have any right to be! Each rank reduces
damage you take from Grapple Taijutsu by 5%.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 4<br>
###### Scale: 1<br>
###### Limit: RES /20, max 10<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Rigorous Training =-<br>
<br>
You've spent time training in, or just being exposed to, extreme
conditions; sitting under waterfalls, trudging through sand dunes, or
enduring intense cold without the proper clothing are all examples of
how this might come about. You have a +1 bonus to Resistance rolls per
rank.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 2<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: RES /20<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Unarmed Focus =-<br>
You've trained to improve your sheer physical prowess; even when
resorting to simple, non-jutsu attacks, you hit hard. May or may not be
the result of deciding to train by punching trees until your knuckles
bleed.<br>
<br>
Each rank lets you roll one more die when making a basic unarmed attack.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 3<br>
###### Scale: 0<br>
###### Limit: (STR - 20) /10<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Mobility<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Evasive =-<br>
You're big on not being around when people try to violently end your
life. Every rank gives you a +1 bonus to dodge, it's awesome!<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 4<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: AGI /20, max 10<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Nimble =-<br>
When targeted by an area-of-effect attack that gives you a dodge
penalty based on its size, that penalty is reduced by 2 per rank, to a
minimum of 0.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 4<br>
###### Scale: 1<br>
###### Limit: AGI /20<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Runner =-<br>
You're both a distance runner and sprinter! Pretty awesome, huh? Every
rank in this ability increases your AGI for the purpose of movement by
10% when you're taking a Move action; moving as part of an attack, or
techniques such as Shunshin, do not receive Runner's bonus.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 3<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: Athletics /3, max 5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Sudden Attack =-<br>
You sacrifice power for speed and precision, trying to overwhelm or
overcome your opponent's defenses before they have a chance to protect
themselves. For every rank, you may take a bonus of up to +1 on a
damaging taijutsu attack's Accuracy; each +1 reduces its damage by 10%.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 4<br>
###### Scale: 1<br>
###### Limit: DEX /20, max 5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Swift =-<br>
Swift, adjective; happening quickly or promptly. Your swiftness allows
you to react faster, and makes it harder for your opponents to keep up
with you. Each rank gives you +1 to Accuracy.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 8<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: (AGI - 50) /10, max 5&lt;/text&gt;<br>

1. Deception<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Cunning =-<br>
You're an expert at misdirection; you know the signs people look for
and pick up on in battle, and you know how to either give the wrong
ones, or none at all. This gives you a +1 bonus to Accuracy per rank.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 8<br>

______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Cunning Blow =-<br>
If you attack an opponent within 10 IC after you've successfully
defended against an attack they made which targeted you, you have a +4
bonus to Accuracy.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 50<br>
###### Requires: 20 Espionage<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Stalker =-<br>
Somewhere along the way you picked up the unpleasant, but highly
effective talent of being able to follow people for prolonged periods
of time without being noticed.<br>
<br>
Each rank gives you +1 to your Stealth TN once you're already hidden.
The odd ranks (1, 3, and 5) each give +1 to your Accuracy with Sneak
Attacks made from stealth.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 6<br>
###### Scale: 3<br>
###### Limit: DEX /20, max 5<br>

______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Subterfuge =-<br>
You are all kinds of sneaky. You know how to lie and make it seem like
you're telling the truth, or how to tell the truth while convincing
anyone listening that it's a lie.<br>
<br>
Every rank gives you +1 to Espionage and Stealth rolls.<br>

====================<br>
2. Ninja Tactics<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Basic Training =-<br>
Ninja with the ability to use chakra can get away with not solving
every problem through the application of stealth and cunning, it's
true. But, to be viewed as a proper ninja, they need to be keenly aware
of their surroundings, masters of deception, and able to vanish like a
shadow.<br>
<br>
In practice, genin find those things exceptionally boring, especially
when they could be learning how to shoot fireballs instead. Every rank
gives you a +1 bonus to Accuracy, defensive rolls, and skill checks.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 10<br>
###### Scale: 5<br>
###### Limit: Lower of Awareness /5, Espionage /5, or Stealth /5 ; max
5 ranks<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Defensive Formation =-<br>
You take up a position protecting someone from harm. Very useful on
escort missions when you have to keep some blubbering civilian safe!
You declare this as an action the same way you would blocking, while
designating one or more (up to 1+XP/1000) targets within AGI/20 yards
of you. If one of those people is attacked during your Defensive
Formation, you may immediately attempt to Take The Hit, without
increasing your next action as would be normal for using an Interrupt,
with a +10 bonus.<br>
<br>
Against area-of-effect attacks, if you do this you take the full
damage, and they take only half (which they can reduce by their own
defenses). The protected target can still defend themself, but if they
move out of your protective radius the Defensive Formation is
automatically aborted.<br>
<br>
You may simultaneously declare any two of: Block, Guard, Total Defense,
Defensive Formation, and similar actions not listed in this chapter
(such as the Uchiha's Observe).<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 25<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Guard =-<br>
You ready yourself for an impending attack. Guard is an action declared
similar to blocking. While Guarding, you have a +5 bonus to accuracy
when parrying enemy attacks (including with jutsu, such as Halting Blow
and Crossroads of Heaven). Your Parry action itself becomes a Speed 0
Interrupt.<br>
<br>
You may simultaneously declare any two of: Block, Guard, Total Defense,
Defensive Formation, and similar actions not listed in this chapter
(such as the Uchiha's Observe).<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 20<br>
###### Requires: 45 DEX<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### -= Safety Dance =-<br>
This does not actually have anything to do with dancing. Indeed, if you
are dancing, you probably won't be able to pull this off! You stay on
edge while recuperating mid-battle, never letting your guard down. When
you take a Rest action, you are also considered to be Blocking until
your next non-Interrupt action.<br>
<br>

====================<br>
1. Enhanced Senses<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Enhanced Hearing =-<br>
Your hearing isn't actually (much) better than a normal person's, but
you've learned how to not do what everyone normally does: tune out
quiet, 'insignificant' background noises. You still can if you need to,
but you can also avoid doing that, when you need to, say, listen for a
skulking opponent.<br>
<br>
This gives you a +1 bonus to Awareness rolls per rank.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 4<br>
###### Scale: 3<br>
###### Limit: CHA /10, max 4<br>
<br>
Special: The two &amp;quot;Enhanced (Sense)&amp;quot; abilities
share a Scale. That is, if you already had four ranks of Enhanced
Sight, the first rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost (4+(3*4) = ) 16 XP.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Enhanced Sight =-<br>
You're very good with attention to detail. You notice things that other
people overlook, and as it turns you, that's a pretty useful
job-related talent for a ninja. You get +1 Awareness per rank.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 4<br>
###### Scale: 3<br>
###### Limit: CHA /10, max 4<br>
<br>
Special: The two &amp;quot;Enhanced (Sense)&amp;quot; abilities

Sight, the first rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost (4+(3*4) = ) 16 XP.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Blind Fighting =-<br>
Between smoke bombs, stealth missions at night, and hostile ninjutsu,
shinobi often find themselves operating with their vision impaired.
This ability represents training to fight while relying on your other
senses. Each rank of Blind Fighting reduces the maximum visibility
penalty you can suffer from by 1.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 7<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: Enhanced Hearing ranks, max 4<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Keen Senses<br>
You're very good at picking up on tiny things that are just
ever-so-slightly out of place! Normally, you get a cumulative +2 bonus
every time you attempt to find someone using a Search action in combat.
This raises that to +3 at the first rank, and +4 at the second.<br>
<br>

2. Perception<br>
------------------------------<br>

You've got good hand-eye coordination, which lends itself towards
hitting with your attacks. You have a +1 bonus per rank to your
Accuracy.<br>

You've learned to rely on your instincts to guide you in battle,
helping to improve your reaction time. Not by much--but enough to
matter. Each rank gives a +1 bonus to dodge.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 8<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: Survival /5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Sixth Sense =-<br>
Ninja really do seem to have one, and no experienced shinobi will deny
it, not once they've faced down an opponent and actually, physically
felt the killing intent radiating from them, or experienced a
half-second of dread in the instant before an ambush was sprung. Nobody
can quantify it, or say for sure what causes it, but ninja who don't
want to die do well to listen to it.<br>
<br>
You have a +1 bonus to Awareness and defensive rolls per rank. Whenever
you would be surprise or sneak attacked this automatically activates,
allowing you to defend against it as if it was a normal attack. Each
time this activates, the Awareness and defensive bonuses are reduced by
1 each; once they reach 0, your Sixth Sense stops functioning. This
refreshes at the beginning of each day.<br>

<br>
====================<br>
1. Nature Control<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Elemental Affinity =-<br>
<br>
Every ninja has a natural affinity for one of the five primary
elements, though some may not discover it until later. This ability can
be taken for any one of the five elements, even one your character
cannot use.<br>
<br>
For each rank, you get a +1 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra
Control rolls involving your favored element. The Chakra Control skill
requirements to learn jutsu of your chosen element are considered 1
point lower, per rank. You may only take this ability for a single
element, ever.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 0<br>
###### Scale: +1<br>
###### Limit: CHA /20, max 5<br>
<br>
Some clans start with a specific Elemental Affinity, giving them one
rank in this ability. This does not (necessarily) provide them with the
matching Elemental Aptitude, though it does mean they cannot change
their affinity.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Elemental Aptitude =-<br>
<br>
The shinobi of the world recognize five primary elements of chakra:
fire, water, wind, earth, and lightning. These elements and their
properties form the basis of most modern ninjutsu techniques.<br>
<br>
However, actually using elemental chakra requires the ability to
convert one's own chakra to the appropriate element, which is what this
ability provides.<br>
<br>
In simpler terms, when you take Elemental Aptitude, select one of the
five elements; you may use elemental ninjutsu of that element. Each
additional rank of this ability allows you to use another element.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 5<br>
###### Scale: +25<br>
###### Limit: 3<br>
<br>
Certain clans begin with one or more ranks in this ability. In these
cases, they have the first one or two ranks in this ability for free,
but must pay that cost when buying the next one.<br>
<br>
For example, a Touu begins with elemental aptitude for Water and Wind.
Normally, this would cost (5 + (5+25)) 35 XP; instead, it costs 0.
However, when they buy access to their third element, doing so costs
(55 + 35) 90 XP.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Shape Control<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Improved Area =-<br>
This supplements your ninjutsu techniques, increasing their areas of
effect by up to your ninjutsu damage bonus; you can use some, all, or
none of this effect on a given technique, as you please. This bonus
cannot exceed the technique's base area.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 20<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Improved Range =-<br>
You're able to keep your chakra coherent for longer; the further it can
travel before dissipating (or the faster you can propel it, or
whatever)... well, the advantages should be obvious. This increases the
range of any ninjutsu techniques you use by up to double your ninjutsu
damage bonus in yards. This bonus cannot exceed the technique's base
range.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 20<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Potent Chakra =-<br>
You're able to increase your chakra's density, and in turn preserve
some of the energy that would dissipate into the atmosphere around you
in whatever sort of attack you're using.<br>
<br>
But all you really care about is that it makes your ninjutsu hurt more!
Each rank increases your ninjutsu damage bonus by 0.2.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 1<br>
###### Scale: 1<br>
###### Limit: CHA /10<br>
###### Requires: 80 CHA<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Chakra Control<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Refined Chakra Control =-<br>
<br>
Your precise control of chakra allows you to spend it more efficiently,
wasting less and getting more out of what you do spend. Each rank of
this ability gives you a +1 bonus on your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 6<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: Chakra Control /5, max 5<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Wall Walking =-<br>
Every village teaches this, usually to their genin, as a form of
training to hone their chakra control skills. Training involves
focusing a fixed amount of chakra at the bottom of one's feet and using
that to adhere to a wall, tree, or other vertical surface.<br>
<br>
With this ability you can scale vertical surfaces, stand on ceilings,
and so forth, at your normal movement speed.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 10<br>
###### Requires: 8 Chakra Control<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Water Walking =-<br>
You can stand on water! Ninja do this in the same way they'd adhere to
a vertical surface, though actually pulling it off is much harder
because the water is constantly moving underneath them, meaning the
strength and distribution of chakra has to be constantly changed. Once
a shinobi is skilled enough, though, this becomes second nature, just
like keeping one's balance on an unsteady surface.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 15<br>

4. Advanced Training<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Genjutsu Training =-<br>
You've mastered the art of... yeah, okay, no. You are able to use
entry-level Genjutsu techniques. It's not much, but it's a start.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 20<br>
###### Requires: Research 4<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Advanced Medical Training =-<br>
<br>
You've spent enough time studying the human body and how it interacts
with chakra, and honing your medical skills, to use even the most
advanced medicinal techniques. This ability allows you to learn medical
ninjutsu of B rank and above.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 25<br>
###### Requires: Medical Training talent, Skill Focus: Medicine 5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Advanced Seal Training =-<br>
<br>
As in sealing techniques, not handseals! This allows you to learn the
most advanced fuuinjutsu. These are often extremely complicated, and
even slight mistakes result in them being useless. Through unrelenting
practice and hours of study, you've gained a sufficient understanding
of how and why seals work to be able to handle the most advanced
techniques.<br>
<br>
This ability allows you to learn A-rank Sealing Ninjutsu.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 25<br>

====================<br>
5. Genjutsu<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Attentive =-<br>
You pay lots of attention to details! Beyond that, you're keen to pick
up on things that other people wouldn't. Maybe that species of deer
isn't native to this area, or the wood of an illusory wall is a type
that isn't found in this part of the world.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the more you know about these kinds of things, the
more likely you are to get them right. Each rank gives a +1 bonus to
your genjutsu rolls.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 8<br>
###### Scale: 3<br>
###### Limit: Research /5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Genjutsu Awareness =-<br>
You're good at picking up little details in your environment that
aren't quite what they should be. Maybe it's that the ringing noise in
your head isn't reverberating right, maybe it's that whoever
constructed an illusion around you forgot to put door handles on all
the doors.<br>
<br>
Whatever it is, it gives you a +1 bonus to defensive Genjutsu rolls per
rank.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 10<br>
###### Scale: 5<br>
###### Limit: Lower of your Enhanced Hearing or Enhanced Sight ranks<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Genjutsu Competence =-<br>
Genjutsu is notoriously difficult; very few ninja are able to just
'pick it up' without difficulty. Even being mediocre with genjutsu
requires a significant amount of training and practice--which this
ability represents.<br>
<br>
Each rank gives you a +1 bonus to your offensive Genjutsu rolls.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 2<br>
###### Scale: 0<br>
###### Limit: (XP + 200)/400<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Genjutsu Mastery =-<br>
Okay, NOW you've mastered the art of Genjutsu. Each rank gives you a +1
bonus to genjutsu rolls.<br>
<br>
You can have 1 rank in this ability for each rank of genjutsu you know
at least one technique from. Thus, if you knew an E-rank, D-rank, and
B-rank move, you could have 3 ranks of Genjutsu Mastery.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 6<br>
###### Scale: 4<br>
###### Limit: Special<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Illusion Multi-Targeting =-<br>
This allows you to apply a genjutsu which normally must target a single
person at once to any number of people. Every 1 point of Willpower
spent allows your genjutsu to target two more people, at no additional
cost and using your same genjutsu roll.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 25<br>
###### Requires: Know at least one C-rank Genjutsu.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

====================<br>
1. Ninja Tools<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Money: Requisition =-<br>
<br>
As a ninja, you get most of your supplies from your village. This
ability represents how much you're authorized to bring with you on any
mission. For every rank, you can have 50 Ryo worth of equipment from
the Equipment chapter at once.<br>
<br>
This works more like a limit than something you actually 'spend'; you
can replaced used items, trade in ones you no longer have a need for,
and so forth, at will so long as you're not away from the village.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 2<br>
###### Scale: 0<br>
###### Limit: None<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Money: Savings =-<br>
<br>
This is a nest egg of money you've set aside and saved up over time.
For each rank, you have 100 Ryo that you can spend as you please.
However, this money cannot be refunded or replenished; used or broken
items are simply lost.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 2<br>
###### Scale: 0<br>
###### Limit: None<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Bingo Book =-<br>
The bingo book is a pocket-sized book put out by each village, with
information on missing nin and enemy ninja of note. This information
includes their bounties, their reputation, and any abilities which the
village may be willing to publicize.<br>
<br>
Having this ability means you keep an up-to-date copy of the bingo
book; you can steal someone else's, but they generally get updated
every few months.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Icha Icha Novels =-<br>
<br>
Icha Icha is a series of best-selling novels written by the legendary
ninja sage Jiraiya. They are comedic (and adult) recounts of Jiraiya's
experiences in love. The titles include Icha Icha Paradise, Icha Icha
Violence, Icha Icha Tactics, and Icha Icha Utopia.<br>
<br>
They are intended only for audiences over 18 years of age, and managing
to acquire and read them in secret is a challenge countless young ninja
strive to overcome. Indeed, it's how many shinobi (though most kunoichi
would never admit it) hone their abilities of stealth and deception.<br>
<br>
For every rank, you have read one of the Icha Icha novels. Every novel
you've read gives you a +1 bonus to your Espionage rolls.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 6<br>
###### Scale: 4<br>
###### Limit: 4<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Aerosolized Poisons =-<br>
As popular as poisons are with (some) shinobi, they suffer from being
relatively difficult to deliver effectively. While gaseous poisons are
one of the most effective ways of accomplishing that, very few of the
toxins suitable for use against shinobi can be deployed that way.<br>
<br>
Unless, of course, someone is willing to invest a great deal of time
and resources into specially preparing those poisons, and learning
enough about them to understand the dangers of those preparations.<br>
<br>
Like you!<br>
<br>
This ability allows you to create a Poison Smoke Bomb from any Contact
poison (as found in the Equipment chapter). The total cost for the
poison smoke bomb is doubled (for example, Water Hemlock Poison Smoke
Bombs would be 1200 ryo each), and the Toxicology roll has a -4 penalty.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 50<br>
###### Requires: 25 Toxicology<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Tag Concealment =-<br>
Ninjas do love their explosions. However, they also like being sneaky
and unseen; this combines the two!<br>
<br>
When placing an exploding tag, you can hide it from the casual
observer. This requires something for it to be hidden under (such as
loose soil, or leaves; you cannot 'hide' them in plain sight in a
featureless room). Hiding a tag is a Speed 10 action, and anyone
watching you will realize what you're doing and where it is (meaning it
cannot be accomplished outside of stealth in combat).<br>
<br>
When you hide the tag, make an Espionage roll. Anyone who enters the
tag's range is allowed an Awareness roll against the result, without
any bonuses they may have from the Enhanced Hearing ability. Success
means they've spotted the tag.<br>
<br>
Once a tag has begun its countdown to detonation they start to sizzle
and spark, alerting anyone to their presence and approximate direction
(though not exact location), giving them a chance to escape before time
runs out.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 10<br>
<br>

<br>
====================<br>
2. Weapons, Melee<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Ambidextrous =-<br>
You've trained yourself to use your off-hand just as well as your
dominant one, or you really are naturally ambidextrous. Each rank
reduces the Accuracy penalty for dual-wielding (see below) by 1, and
gives you a +1 bonus to parries using those weapons while dual-wielding.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 5<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: DEX /20, max 5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Dual Wielding =-<br>
You attack with a weapon in each hand! Impractical, but awesome. As
might be expected, this allows you to make a basic weapon attack with
both weapons simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Halve the speed of both the weapons you're using (rounding up, as
usual). Add those two numbers together to get the speed of your
&amp;quot;Dual Wield Attack&amp;quot; action.<br>
<br>
You use the lower of the two weapons' Accuracy. This is defended
against as a single attack, using its total Speed. The Stamina cost to
Dual-Wield is the higher Stamina cost of the two weapons, plus one
third of the lower Stamina cost.<br>
<br>
If you hit, you deal damage separately for both weapons, using the
reduced Speed for each to determine their damage bonus. Weapons
specifically marked as &amp;quot;Dual&amp;quot; calculate
damage based on their natural Speed, rather than the halved value.<br>
<br>
Lowering the Speed of a Dual Wield Attack action lowers the effective
Speeds (for determining damage) of both component attacks by the same
amount.<br>
<br>
This can't be done with two-handed weapons. Unfortuantely,
dual-wielding carries with it a -5 Accuracy penalty.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 25<br>
###### Requires: 40 DEX<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Monkey Grip =-<br>
By using extreme strength, chakra-based powers, and a cheerful
disregard for physics, you are able to use two-handed weapons in one
hand! Notably, this means they no longer benefit from their 50%
increase in your damage bonus.<br>
<br>
At the second rank you can, if you have the Dual Wield ability, even
dual wield two-handed weapons.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 30<br>
###### Scale: +10<br>
###### Limit: STR /50, max 2<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Quick Draw =-<br>
The speed of your Draw Weapon is reduced by 1 per rank, to a minimum of
0.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 7<br>
###### Scale: 1<br>
###### Limit: DEX /30<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Weapon Focus: (Weapon) =-<br>
You've trained yourself specifically with a single type of weapon.
Choose one of the weapons from the Equipment chapter (such as
Wakizashi, or Shuriken). You have +1 Accuracy and +1 to your damage
bonus when using that weapon, per rank.<br>
<br>
You may take this ability for different weapons, counting as a
different ability (with a separate cost, number of ranks, etc.) each
time. Any attack which benefits from your Weapon Focus has its Stamina
cost increased by 3 per rank; you may choose to use less than your full
ranks of Weapon Focus on a given attack if you wish.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 6<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: (DEX -30) /30, max 3<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Weapon Throw =-<br>
Your hatred of physics gives you improbable powers. You are able to
throw any melee weapon you're holding up to STR/4 yards, turning it
into a ranged attack. This does the normal damage for that weapon, but
increases the action's Stamina cost by 5.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 15<br>
###### Requires: 40 STR, 40 DEX<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Blunt: Stun =-<br>
Your attacks stagger an opponent, club them upside the head, knock the
wind out of them, or otherwise keeping them from recovering. Your blunt
weapon attacks gain Stun 1 per rank, or increase their existing Stun by
1 per rank.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 5<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: STR /20<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Large: Momentum =-<br>
You turn one of the greatest enemies of shinobi--physics--to your own
ends. Each rank gives a -1 penalty to any enemy's attempts to parry
your weapon.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 4<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: STR /20, max 5<br>

<br>
### -= Piercing: Penetrate =-<br>
Your piercing weapons ignore any armor your opponent is wearing!<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 20<br>
###### Requires: 35 STR<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Polearm: Trip =-<br>
You sweep with the blunt end (or one of the blunt ends) of your weapon,
knocking your opponent's feet out from beneath them. This allows you to
use Trip (the E-rank Unarmed Taijutsu technique) as a Weapon Taijutsu,
as long as you know it.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 10<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Slashing: Perfect Cut =-<br>
Normally, when partial defense applies you would deal 20% of your
attack's damage per point you hit by. With this ability you do 25% per
point you hit by, up to full damage if you hit by 4 points.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 20<br>
###### Requires: 40 DEX<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Small: Flurry =-<br>
Most of the small weapons rely on something other than overpowering
force to deal their damage; accordingly, a dozen quick strikes is often
preferable to six slow, powerful ones.<br>
<br>
Each time you make an attack with a Small weapon, the total Speed of
your next attack with that weapon is reduced by 1. This stacks for
consecutive attacks; if you make three attacks with your weapon,
without taking any non-Interrupt action inbetween, the next attack
would have -3 total Speed. As a reminder, total Speed cannot go below
half of base Speed. The maximum reduction is your number of ranks in
this ability.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 4<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: DEX /20<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Sword: Iaijutsu =-<br>
The first time in battle you attack with your sword, if you have yet to
draw it (meaning it hasn't be used for parries or jutsu, either) the
attack's Speed is halved, though for the purpose of damage calculations
it's treated as its regular speed. This may only be done once per
battle, even if you have more than one sword.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 20<br>
###### Requires: 50 DEX, 40 AGI<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Weapons, Ranged<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Assassin's Eye =-<br>
You've got a good eye for causing bodily harm to people from a
distance. In any other job, this would just make you kind of scary. As
a ninja, it looks good on your resume! Each rank of this ability
reduces the penalty for called shots with ranged weapons by 1.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 6<br>
###### Scale: 4<br>
###### Limit: DEX /30, max 3<br>
###### Requires: Enhanced Sight 3<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Combat Acupuncture =-<br>
You can throw senbon to target vital points on an opponent's body.
Whenever making a called shot with senbon, if you deal damage you
inflict a -1 immobilization penalty on your foe. Using this on somebody
already suffering from it increases the Immobilization penalty by 1
each time. Its effects end entirely 20 IC after the last time you hit
with a senbon called shot. The maximum penalty is your ranks in Combat
Acupuncture.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 2<br>
###### Scale: 2<br>
###### Limit: DEX /10<br>
###### Requires: Medicine 10<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Explosive Tag Connection =-<br>
As a Speed 10 + 5 * X action, you can attach X tags to a kunai's hilt
or an arrow, and prime them. These can be attached pre-battle as a
matter of convenience, but the action to prime them is still necessary.
You can have up to (Chakra Control)/5 tags primed this way at once.<br>
<br>
Each item (kunai or arrow) may only have a single tag attached to it.
You can trigger these tags as part of a multi-throw, or do so later
(such as by the Remote Detonation technique). When the kunai is thrown
(or arrow shot) the tag(s) will detonate 15 IC after impact (with the
target, or the ground at the target's feet on a miss).<br>
<br>
When used as a multi-throw, each tagged kunai counts as two weapons for
the purpose of determining multi-throwing limit. You can include up to
one tag per rank in this ability in a single throw.<br>
<br>
If a target is struck by the arrow or kunai, they're assumed to pull it
out as a non-action and can try to escape the area. Justu including
exploding tags that cause them to explode on contact supercede these
rules. <br>

###### Scale: 3<br>
###### Limit: Chakra Control / 5<br>
<br>

<br>
### -= Improved Range =-<br>
You can throw weapons farther than other people! It's useful,
honest!... Kind of. Sometimes. Your max range with thrown weapons is
increased by your damage bonus.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 15<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Marksman =-<br>
You've got uncannily good aim at a distance. You may give your ranged
weapon attacks a bonus of up to +1 Accuracy per rank. However, each +1
received this way increases the Stamina cost of the action by 2.<br>
<br>
In the case of ninjutsu which behave as ranged weapon attacks, increase
whichever cost(s) the technique has (such as the Chakra cost on the
D-rank Attached Meteor technique).<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 8<br>
###### Scale: 4<br>
###### Limit: DEX /30<br>

______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Quick Hands =-<br>
You're very good at throwing lots of small objects very quickly!<br>
<br>
This allows you to throw an extra 1 die of weapons when multi-throwing,
without increasing the action's Speed; the Stamina cost is still
increased normally (+1 for every 2 weapons total, adding together ones
added normally and ones added by Quick Hands).<br>

### -= Senbon Multi-Throw =-<br>
You can multi-throw needles, just like you can normally multi-throw
shuriken and kunai.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 15<br>
###### Requires: 30 DEX<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Senbon User =-<br>
You're a person who uses senbon in combat. This is rare, but not
unheard of; it takes a lot of effort to get results out of them, but a
weapon that allows the degree of precision they do can certainly be
rewarding.<br>
<br>
This ability removes their inherent -2 Accuracy penalty, and allows you
to use your DEX, rather than STR, to determine your damage bonus with
senbon. Finally, damage dealt by senbon is tripled for the purposes of
calculating wounds.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 15<br>
###### Requires: 25 DEX<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Surgical Precision =-<br>
When you wound an enemy with a senbon attack, you have a 10% chance per
rank for the wound to be upgraded to the next-highest rank. If you
don't wound them, this is replaced by a 10% chance per rank to cause a
minor wound, so long as your attack did any damage. Every rank of this
ability also raises the attack's Stamina cost by 1; you can choose
whether or not to use it, and to what extent, when you attack.<br>
<br>
If used on a multi-throwing attack with senbon, this is applied before
the one-rank reduction in wound severity (from being a multi-throw).<br>

<br>
====================<br>
1. Willpower<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Desperation =-<br>
<br>
Being faced with truly dire straits brings out remarkable
characteristics: in animals, in civilians, and in shinobi. Thankfully,
you're one of those!<br>
<br>
You can activate this ability when defending against an attack by
spending a point of Willpower. Your Interrupt only needs to be double
or less the Speed of the attack you're defending against, rather than
half or less. This effect persists of the duration of that IC; if
you're being attack four times in the same IC, then all four defenses
would receive this benefit.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 40<br>
###### Requires: 6 Willpower<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Determination =-<br>
<br>
Your force of will is as powerful an advantage in combat as your
strength of body. Each rank of this ability increases your Willpower by
1.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 50<br>
###### Scale: 25<br>
###### Limit: XP /1000<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Focus =-<br>
<br>
Being left reeling and disoriented is an all-too-common experience for
shinobi. Sometimes it's the result of genjutsu, other times it's a
lucky blow to the solar plexus (or... lower). You're able to bring
yourself back to the presence, by sheer mental fortitude, though doing
so is bound to wear you out faster in the long run.<br>
<br>
By spending 1 Willpower, you end any Stuns you're suffering from and
become immune to any other instances of that status effect until the
end of the current Initiative Count.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 40<br>
###### Requires: 4 Willpower<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Guts =-<br>
<br>
You refuse to go down in battle. So long as you're physically able to
breathe, you will not stop fighting when your values are on the line.
This can get downright frightening to behold, depending upon the
circumstances.<br>
<br>
Whenever you would be reduced to 0 HP or lower, roll a TN 25 Stamina
check. If you succeed, you are left with 1 HP, and cannot have your HP
reduced until the end of that initiative count. If you fail, in
addition to your Fatigue progressing you take the damage you normally
would have from the attack. Damage negated through this ability still
wounds you normally.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 50<br>
###### Requires: 3 Willpower<br>

### -= Limit Break =-<br>
<br>
Through sheer determination you force yourself to perform above your
own capabilities. Once per day, per rank, you may reroll any roll, or
replace an Accuracy number with a d20 roll that adds your normal
Accuracy rating as a bonus (not including the base 10 Accuracy). If
this is a d20 roll and the result is below 11, add 10 to the die roll.<br>
<br>
However, doing this causes you to immediately proceed to the next
Fatigue category. This ability can be used after you've determined
whether your roll or attack would've succeeded normally.<br>

2. Initiative<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Defensive Reflexes =-<br>
<br>
You're always ready to protect yourself, even when caught off guard.
You may declare use of this ability when rolling your initiative for
combat. You are considered to be blocking at the start of battle, but
take a -4 penalty on your initiative roll. This penalty is reduced by 1
for each rank beyond the first.<br>

### -= Reflexes =-<br>
<br>
You have excellent twitch reflexes. Mostly, this comes in handy for a
ninja; you respond to danger before even fully determining what that
danger is. This can be kind of awkward off-duty, when you respond to
somebody trying to startle you by punching them in the gut and then
flipping them over your shoulder, but that's what they get for trying
to startle a ninja anyway. Each rank gives you +1 Initiative and each
even rank gives a +1 Athletics bonus.<br>

make things up as you go along! You start battle with (AGI)*(number of
ranks in this ability)/20 AP.<br>

3. Action Points<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Active =-<br>
You get a lot done in combat. Whether it's quickly assessing the
battlefield, exploiting an opening, or having that extra bit of
adrenaline, you're already doing what needs to be done.<br>
<br>
Every rank in this ability increases the AP you naturally gain each 20
IC by 1. Thus, if you had 3 ranks of Active, you'd get (5 + 3) 8 AP
every time the IC reached a multiple of 20.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 2<br>
###### Scale: 1<br>
###### Limit: AGI /20<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Principle of Motion =-<br>
You're able to act blindingly fast, beyond what all reason suggests
should be possible. You may at any time cause your next action to come
1 IC earlier for every 2 AP you spend.<br>
<br>
For example, say it's initiative count 200, and you just took a speed
12 action. Your action ends that IC, moving the battle onto IC 201;
normally your next action would occur on IC (200+12) = 212. By spending
22 AP, you could act on (IC 212 - 11) 201, in other words, immediately.<br>
<br>
This only allows your next action to come sooner; it does not let you
finish an ongoing action sooner. As such, Principle of Motion can't be
used to make you finish Handseals early, or while you are in the
process of using any action with a Delay.<br>
<br>
Similarly, you can not use Principle of Motion to reverse time. You may
use Principle of Motion only to bring your next action to what the
current initiative count is. This means that if you take an action on
IC 16, once it is resolved IC 17 begins--and that is the earliest you
could activate Principle of Motion, meaning you would be unable to act
twice on the same initiative count.<br>
<br>
After using Principle of Motion, you may not use it again until 10 IC
have passed. You may not use Principle of Motion while stunned.<br>
<br>
###### Cost: 60<br>
###### Requires: 100 DEX, 100 AGI<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Surge =-<br>
You can spend AP to improve an attack's accuracy, or a defensive
action's roll. This costs 8 AP per +1 Accuracy, and 5 AP per +1 to a
defensive roll. Either way, Surge may give a maximum of a +5 bonus, and
is declared when the roll (or attack) is made.<br>

### -= Anatomical Knowledge =-<br>
Your knowledge of the human body develops sinister undertones. You
can't learn how to treat life-threatening injuries without picking up
more than a little bit of knowledge of how to cause life-threatening
injuries. Each rank causes your taijutsu attacks (including those with
ranged weapons, just as a reminder) to calculate wounds as if their
damage was 5% higher.<br>

### -= Doctor =-<br>
Aside from the basics of health and biology, and how to stabilize a
dying comrade on the field, you've learned how to provide longer-term
care for your allies.<br>
<br>
At the first rank of this ability, you are able to provide 'medical
attention' to people (as per the Recovery node in the combat chapter),
as of they were hospitalized. Doing so requires you to have access to
one First Aid kit per person you treat this way.<br>
<br>
At the second rank, you may do this even without a First Aid kit.
Finally, at the third rank, the recovery times for all people you are
treating are halved, even beyond the normal reductions for receiving
medical attention--you're just that good.<br>
<br>
You can treat a number of people at once equal to your ranks in the
Medicine skill. This is long-term treatment, so you can still take
breaks, sleep, and so forth, as long as you are devoting most of your
time to helping them heal.<br>

### -= General Knowledge =-<br>
You know a little bit about everything, and a lot about a few things.

than knowledge. For those that don't, you've got an extra edge! You
have +1 per rank to Medicine, Survival, and Toxicology rolls.<br>

### -= Skill Focus: (Skill) =-<br>
This ability allows you to focus on a single skill at the expense of
your overall performance. Most of the skills a ninja develops are
picked up as a course of their regular training and experience. Skill
focus represents taking extra time to focus on a specific talent, to
the extent of all others.<br>
<br>
Each rank of Skill Focus increases your rank in the chosen skill by 1.
This is an actual increase in rank, for all purposes, not a
&amp;quot;bonus&amp;quot;. This ignores and does not count
against the normal limit on skill ranks. You may take Skill Focus for
multiple skills, each time treating it as a different ability with a
separate cost scale.<br>
<br>
###### Base Cost: 2 Skill Points<br>
###### Scale: +1 Skill Point every odd-numbered rank<br>

______________________<br>
<br>
### -= Specialization =-<br>
<br>
You practice extensively with a chosen skill, so that even while you
may still make mistakes, you don't make catastrophic ones; even at your
worst, you're not terrible. Any time you roll below a 5 on a roll with
that skill, your d20 roll is instead considered to be a 5.<br>
<br>
You may take this ability multiple times. Each time you take it, it
applies to a different skill.<br>

5. Development<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
### -= Holding Back =-<br>
<br>
...is a good idea when those 'friendly' training matches get a little
bit out of control. You declare you're holding back when you make an
attack. An attack that's been held back uses half your normal damage
bonus, and any wounds it inflicts have their severity reduced by 1.<br>
<br>
At the first rank this works on basic attacks and with E-rank jutsu;
the next rank allows it to be used on D-ranks, the third on C-ranks,
and so forth, up to A.<br>
<br>
No, you can't hold back with S-rank moves.<br>

### -= Progression =-<br>
<br>
Ordinarily, when raising your attributes, the amount you've raised one
by must be within 3 points of the amount the next-highest has been
raised by, and so forth (the 'rule of 3'). Every rank in this ability
loosens that restriction by one.<br>
<br>
Thus, instead of having spent XP to raise three stats by +3, +6, and
+9, you could have a progression of +4, +8, and +12.<br>

# Jutsu<br>
&gt;1. Explanation<br>
2. Rules<br>
3. Reader's Guide<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Explanation<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The core of a ninja's supernatural capabilities comes from their
jutsu--meaning, literally, techniques. These use chakra, either
projected outwards or used to amplify one's physical performance, to
perform feats that woul be literally impossible for a normal person.<br>
<br>
These are divided into three broad categories: taijutsu, ninjutsu, and
genjutsu.<br>
<br>
Taijutsu, or body techniques, use the chakra flowing throughout a
ninja's body to give them the exceptional speed or strength needed to
perform the techniques. They are mostly physical attacks. This includes
both unarmed combat, and weapon techniques.<br>
<br>
Ninjutsu, or ninja techniques, use chakra to accomplish what those
unfamiliar with them might call magic. These effects range from
changing one's appearance to projecting balls of flame, to summoning
water from thin air, to healing grievous injuries.<br>
<br>
Genjutsu, or illusion techniques, use chakra to either construct
illusions in the environment or to directly affect an enemy's mind and
confuse their senses. Of the three, they are the most difficult to
learn.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Rules<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Each jutsu is a unique action that, once you've learned it, you can
perform. All jutsu are divided into five main ranks (E, D, C, B, and
A), with S-rank techniques being rare techniques known only to their
inventor and perhaps a handful of people that person taught them to.<br>
<br>
Though each rank of each type has special requirements to learn
(explained in more detail in the relevant sections), a few broad rules
apply. For example, to learn ninjutsu of one of the five elements, you
need the appropriate Elemental Aptitude ability.<br>
<br>
For the most part, those rules will be explained in the 'Read This!'
nodes within each specific subsection.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Reader's Guide<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Most of the jutsu entries have a lot of information packed into them.
To help make them easier to read, a lot of the common factors are
written using shorthand; for example, rather than spelling out
&amp;quot;Using this technique requires you to make a Chakra
Exhaustion roll against 10&amp;quot;, a jutsu would have an entry
of &amp;quot;Chakra: 10&amp;quot;<br>
<br>
Below are all the common terms you'll see in jutsu entries, and what
they mean.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Stamina:<br>
The technique's Stamina cost.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Chakra:<br>
The technique's Chakra cost.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Upkeep:<br>
Some techniques require a constant expenditure of your energy to
maintain; this is what upkeep represents. So long as you maintain these
techniques (which typically can be done indefinitely) you suffer a
penalty to all Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to that
technique's Upkeep. If you're maintaining multiple techniques with
Upkeeps, these penalties stack.<br>
<br>
If your total Upkeep exceeds your total bonus to Chakra Exhaustion
rolls (not counting any penalties), you automatically advance a Fatigue
level.<br>
<br>
For example, if you had a Chakra Exhaustion roll modifier of +6+2+10-8,
your total bonus would be +18. If you had an Upkeep of 19, your Fatigue
would automatically advance a category, giving you another +5, for a
total bonus of +23.<br>
<br>
You may end any Upkeeps you're sustaining at will, even when it's not
your action.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Damage<br>
The base damage dealt by the technique. You add your damage bonus
(multiplied by the attack's modified Speed) to this number.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp; Accuracy<br>
Some jutsu have bonuses or penalties to accuracy. If there's no entry
for this, it uses your normal accuracy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp; Range<br>
How many yards away the attack's target can be. In the case of
area-of-effect techniques, they can be centered anywhere within this
range (and their effects may well extend beyond it).<br>
<br>
There's one special effect associated with Range: If a ninjutsu
technique has a Range of &amp;quot;Touch&amp;quot;, then it is
possible to defend against it with an unarmed parry.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp; Area<br>
The radius, in yards, of area-of-effect techniques. Some may not use
simple circular areas, in which case more details will be provided in
the description itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; h.&nbsp; Special<br>
Any special effects the technique has. If a status effect is listed
here, it's inflicted automatically.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp; Speed<br>
The jutsu's base Speed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; j.&nbsp; Seal Speed<br>
The jutsu's base seal speed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; k.&nbsp; Effects<br>
Any special characteristics of a technique which aren't covered by one
of the above categories are listed here.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

3. Combos<br>
&nbsp; a. Openers<br>
&nbsp; b. Combos<br>
&nbsp; c. Switching Combos<br>
&nbsp; d. Finishers<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Requirements<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Taijutsu is more than just hand-to-hand combat; ninjutsu techniques go
well beyond the realm of what's possible for normal humans, smashing
rocks and the like. It's not exactly... easy.<br>
<br>
There are three ways to qualify to learn a taijutsu technique: the
first is your rank in the Athletics skill. If you're in good enough
physical condition, you can pull off some pretty impressive things. The
second, Research skill rank: sufficient understanding of how the move
should be executed allows you to make up for your shortcomings.<br>
<br>
Finally, rank: If you're high-enough ranking, you're able to pull
enough strings and ask for enough favors to get someone to spare the
time to tediously instruct you in how to perform a technique, making up
for your own shortcomings.<br>
<br>
Each rank has its own requirements, an each method meets them
differently.<br>
<br>
Rank:<br>
E: Genin<br>
C: Chuunin, Special Jounin<br>
B: Jounin<br>
<br>
Athletics:<br>
D: 4<br>
C: 10<br>
B: 20<br>
A: 30<br>
<br>
Research:<br>
D: 5<br>
C: 12<br>
B: 22<br>
A: 32<br>
<br>
Thus, if you meet any one of those requirements, you can use the jutsu
in question. A Chuunin with 5 Athletics could learn all techniques up
to C rank, whereas one with 20 Athletics could learn all techniques up
to B rank.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Weapon Jutsu<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Weapon jutsu are special techniques which can be performed only while
using a specific sort of weapon.<br>
<br>
All weapon jutsu will have a &amp;quot;Type&amp;quot; entry,
where they'll listen a certain characteristic, such as Slashing or
Sword. Only a weapon which meets these requirements may be used with
that technique.<br>
<br>
Many of these jutsu will list &amp;quot;As Weapon&amp;quot; in
one or more of their entries. For example, if you are using a Stamina
12 weapon, and the technique lists &amp;quot;Stamina: As Weapon
+3&amp;quot;, the Stamina cost to use it would be 15.<br>
<br>
If a weapon has a Delay, then any techniques using it also inherit this
Delay. For example, using Oak Flight (a technique which normally has no
Delay) with a Tetsubo would cause your attack to have Delay 6 (the
Tetsubo's normal Delay).<br>
<br>
If a technique has a Delay of, for example, &amp;quot;As Weapon
+3&amp;quot;, weapons without a Delay are treated as having a
natural Delay 0 (meaning, in that case, the technique would have Delay
3).<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Combos<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Combos are a special type of unarmed taijutsu attack which benefit from
being used in rapid succession. There are three types of taijutsu
attacks related to combos: Openers, Combos, and Finishers.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Openers<br>
Openers are not, themselves, combo moves. However, after an opener
hits, you may launch into a combo (i.e. use a Combo jutsu). Openers are
marked as such in their entry, usually by &amp;quot;Special:
Opener.&amp;quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Combos<br>
Combo moves indicate as much in their name (typically being named
&amp;quot;___ Combo&amp;quot;), or in their 'Special' entry.
You cannot use a combo unless the last non-Interrupt action you took
was a Combo or Opener; similarly, if your combo is broken (see below),
you have to start with a new opener.<br>
<br>
When you begin a combo, you have a &amp;quot;Combo
Counter&amp;quot;--basically, the number of combo moves you've
strung together. This starts at 1 when you hit with an opener. Each
time you hit with a combo, the combo counter increments by 1.<br>
<br>
Each combo will have a combo counter entry; for example, here is Lotus
Combo's:<br>
Combo Counter: +1 Accuracy, +2d10 damage, +1 Stun, +2 Stamina<br>
<br>
This works as might be expected: You multiply those bonuses by the
number of combo counters you've amassed. Thus, if you opened with a
Kage Buyou and proceeded to a Lotus Combo, the first hit would have +1
Accuracy, +2d10 damage, and +1 Stun (because you're at Combo 1 after
the opener); if it hit you'd progress up to Combo 2, and the next combo
you used would have +2 Accuracy, +4d10 damage, +2 Stun, and +2 Stamina
cost.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Switching Combos<br>
Once you've begun a combo, any other combo jutsu is fair game. You
could freely alternate between Lion and Lotus combos as you pleased.
For the most part, things remain simple. Each move increases your Combo
Counter normally, no matter how many times you switch between combo
moves.<br>
<br>
Your Combo Counter bonuses are based only on the move you're currently
using. For example, say you used Kage Buyou as an opener, then 4 Lotus
Combos, followed by 3 Lion Combos. This would give you a total Combo of
8 hits (1 + 4 + 3). If your next Combo move was a Lion combo, you'd
multiply its CC bonuses (+1 Accuracy and -1 Speed) by 8, giving you a
total of +8 Accuracy and -8 Speed (though this would put it at only
Speed 5, because it still can't be reduced below half its base Speed).<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Finishers<br>
The final type of move is finishers. Finishers may be used on their own
normally, but have a special effect if used at the end of a combo.
Though they do not receive the stacking effects for consecutive combo
hits, they have special effects based on your total combo counters.<br>
<br>
For example, the Lion Barrage finisher has the following entry:<br>
Combo Bonus: +2d10 damage<br>
For each combo counter you have when you execute Lion Barrage, its
damage is increased by 2d10.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp; Combo Breaking<br>
When a combo is broken, your combo counter is immediately set to 0, you
may not continue using combo moves, and all accrued combo counter
bonuses are lost.<br>
<br>
Combo breaking occurs if any of the following things happen:<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; You take a non-combo, non-interrupt action.<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; You execute a finisher.<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; You attack a new target.<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; Your target takes damage from an attack made by
someone else.<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; You take damage from an attack made by someone
other than your target.<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; You use any non-combo jutsu (even if it's an
interrupt).<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; You are stunned.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Unarmed Jutsu<br>
<br>
## E-Rank<br>
<br>
### --( Trip )--<br>
You cause an opponent to fall down by knocking their legs out from
under them. Calling it a 'technique' is misleading, but there's more to
unbalancing a ninja than just wanting to; it does take at least a
little bit of training.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: +2 Accuracy<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If this hits, your opponent is allowed an Athletics skill as a
secondary defense against your Accuracy. This Athletics roll has a +3
bonus for every time that battle they've had to make such a roll to
avoid being tripped.<br>
<br>
If they pass, their next action is delayed by 1 but they suffer no
other downsides.<br>
<br>
If they fail, they are left prone on the ground. A prone person has -3
Accuracy, -2 to defensive actions, and moves at half speed. Standing
back up is a Speed 2 action.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Feint )--<br>
A subtle trick that almost every ninja knows--and knows how to
detect.&nbsp; Still, those that are particularly adept at it are
often difficult to defend against properly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; - Stamina: X + 2<br>
&nbsp; - Speed: X + 2<br>
<br>
Effect:<br>
This is used alongside any other melee-range unarmed attack, and
increases that action's Stamina and Speed by 2 each. Make an opposed
Espionage roll; if you beat their result, you've tricked them with your
feint.<br>
<br>
If successful, this doubles the Speed of their defensive action for the
purpose of determining when they'll act next. This doesn't prevent it
from being a valid Interrupt against your attack.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Teiryuu Dageki - Halting Blow )--<br>
In one smooth motion, the user extends their arm and pushed aside an
oncoming blow, steps inward and pulls back their forearm to slam their
elbow into the opponent, turning their defense into their offense.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/10)d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is used as an unarmed parry, with a +3 Accuracy bonus. If you
successfully defend, this becomes an attack which uses the result of
your parry roll as its Accuracy.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Senpuu - Whirlwind )--<br>
The user rotates while extending one leg, starting with a high
roundhouse that's used partially as a feint.&nbsp; Whether it hits
or misses, they continue to rotate into a second spin aimed at the
lower part of the body.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 13<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/10)d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 2<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, this
deals 25% damage per point you hit by, rather than 20%.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Houshou - Crushing Fist )--<br>
Usually considering a rude thing to do to someone, the user slams their
fist into their opponent's stomach at an upward angle, knocking the air
from their lungs if done properly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/10)d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If this hits, it increases the opponent's Stamina penalty by 1, +1 per
category of wound it inflicts (2 at Minor, 3 at Major, and so forth).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Reppuu - Gale )--<br>
With alarming quickness you drop low to the ground and perform a full
360-degree sweeping kick that knocks opponents off their feet when they
attempt to close in for an attack of their own.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/10)d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt, Opener<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may be used immediately after you have successfully dodged a
melee-range attack. Reppuu is an attack against whoever's action you
dodged, and uses your dodge roll as its Accuracy.<br>
<br>
Alternately, you may use Reppuu as a normal attack, using your regular
Accuracy (rather than a dodge roll).<br>
<br>

### --( Dainamikku Entorii - Dynamic Entry )--<br>
This technique is nothing more than a jumpkick at an opponent from
hiding.&nbsp; The hiding part became required because of genin's
tendency to shout out things like &amp;quot;HI-YAH!&amp;quot;
as they did it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/6)d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Requires you be hidden from your target.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
After the first time Dynamic Entry has been used in combat (by you, by
someone else, it doesn't matter) it has a -6 Accuracy for the rest of
that battle.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shoushitsu - Rising Knee )--<br>
The user gets in close and slams their knee into the midsection of
their opponent.&nbsp; While not complex, the pain experienced is
enough to make them double over in pain, leaving them vulnerable for a
few seconds.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /10)d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Tokken - Thrusting Shoulder )--<br>
By charging forward and turning at the last moment to bring a shoulder
out front, the user slams into the enemy, knocking them back.&nbsp;
It relies mostly on the weight of the user, with the expectation
they'll be heavier than the person they're running into.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (RES /10)d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This knocks the victim back (your RES)/15 yards.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Daisenpuu - Great Whirlwind )--<br>
A more complex version of Senpuu which involves three kicks to the
target's body going in the reverse order as before, starting low and
going high to end with an axekick to the opponent's head.&nbsp; The
speed and constant rotation is strong enough to actually lift the
practitioner into the air during execution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /8)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Senpuu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, you
deal 1/3 damage per point you hit by, rather than 20%.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Tsutenkyaku - Painful Sky Leg )--<br>
After concentrating chakra in the user's legs, they leap high into the
air and come down in a destructive axe kick, using gravity to enhance
the momentum behind the blow while the user's chakra is used to enhance
the destructive force of the blow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /8)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: -6 Accuracy<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Your damage bonus is doubled for this attack. Even if it misses, the
opponent might still be damaged by the shockwave (and destruction to
the environment) the kick causes. For every point it misses by, your
damage bonus is reduced by 10%, and its damage is reduced by 2d12.<br>
<br>
Should the issue arise, this technique's
&amp;quot;shockwave&amp;quot; damage does not work against
airborne opponents, including ones who have been rendered so by use of
Kage Buyou.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
### --( Kage Buyou - Shadow of the Dancing Leaf )--<br>
The user lowers themself to get underneath their opponent, and then
knocks them into the air with a violent rising kick, leaping after them
immediately after it to position themselves in the target's shadow.
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /8)d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Opener<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If Kage Buyo hits, and your next action is an unarmed attack against
its victim before they've had an action of their own, your attack has
its Speed reduced by 5 (not below half its base value) and receives +5
Accuracy.<br>
<br>
If used as the opener of a combo, the Accuracy bonus is reduced to +3
but persists until your combo is broken.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Souji Reppuu - Sweeping Gale )--<br>
By flipping forward into a crouch, the user builds momentum that's used
to instantly land and begin spinning on one foot, extending the other
leg out while using chakra to enhance its density, rotating repeatedly
to strike the knees of the enemy, simultaneously evading and tripping
them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /8)d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Trip, Reppuu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This follows the rules for the D-rank Reppuu technique. Should you hit,
the opponent is knocked prone, as per the E-rank Trip's effects.<br>
<br>

### --( Uchikudakute no Jutsu - Shattering Hand Technique )--<br>
Ninja can perform incredible feats of strength; after years of grueling
training, some can literally reduce boulders to gravel for their bare
fists. That's a handy trick to have, but most ninja aren't willing to
go through the whole 'years of pain and hard work' part, so instead
they invented a jutsu which accomplishes a similar effect: by
channelling vibrating chakra through their hand at the moment of
impact, most solid objects can be shattered with a single blow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /8)d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 13<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Delay: 5<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When used against a person, roll location as if it had caused a wound
(unless it was a called shot; if blocked, the defender chooses the
location as usual). Before wounds or damage are calculated, this
completely destroys any armor protecting the location it hits.<br>
<br>
It may also be used against objects, or out of battle, by doubling the
Speed, Delay, and Stamina. In this case, it destroys up to STR/10 cubic
yards of inanimate objects, such as boulders or trees. For this to
work, the material most be contiguous; used against a bridge made from
wooden planks, only a single plank would shatter, though a wall held
together with mortar would count as contiguous. Additionally, it can
only target hard, inflexible materials (i.e. things capable of
shattering); rocks are fair game, ropes are not.<br>
<br>
Two things to be aware of when using its secondary function. The first,
it&nbsp; doesn't work against objects which have been reinforced
with chakra, such as through means of certain sealing jutsu. The
second, it's not nearly as effective as it might sound for
&amp;quot;tunnelling&amp;quot; through walls, mountains, and
the likes--ten cubic meters of shattered stone is still ten cubic
meters of stone, just in small pieces.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Asshou - Pressure Palm )--<br>
You deliver a powerful, downwards palm blow to an opponent's stomach or
the small of their back, brutally knocking the wind from them and
dazing them--repeated use of this can bruise a person's solar plexus,
which pretty much hurts more than anything has any right to, for weeks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/8)d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 12 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may only be used against an opponent who is prone (as from the
E-rank Trip). When it hits, they immediately make a Stamina 15 roll.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Spinning Backfist )--<br>
With a burst of chakra to one of the user's legs, they spin around and
extend an arm to knock an opponent senseless with the back of their
fist.&nbsp; It's a powerful blow as it uses the weight and momentum
of the user's entire body, but has an inherent weakness of losing sight
of the enemy while spinning.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/8)d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique's damage is tripled when determining the severity of
wounds it inflicts.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Attsu Buchikomu - Pain Driver )--<br>
A brutal technique, and completely inappropriate for training (because
someone would have thought it was okay, if we didn't say that). The
attacker finds a weak point on their opponent's body, the site of a
previous injury, and strikes there to amplify the existing wound.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/8)d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This attack must be a called shot, and does not normally inflict
wounds. Instead, if it targets a location with a Minor Blunt wound,
that wound is removed and replaced with a Major Blunt wound on the same
location. This only applies if the attack deals damage.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Maboroshi Tejun - Phantom Step )--<br>
Despite the fancy name, it's a fairly simple 'technique'. With a
momentary burst of energy (and probably adrenaline, considering the
circumstances where it's likely to be used) the user does their best to
get out of the way of an impending attack. The
&amp;quot;phantom&amp;quot; came mostly from the way a shinobi
using this can, to the untrained eye, seem almost to disappear. And
because ninjas thought it sounded cool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 5 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +X<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique is used alongside a dodge attempt, increasing its Speed
by X and providing a +X bonus to your dodge roll, as well as adding a
Stamina cost to your dodge. The increased Speed from Phantom Step
cannot be reduced.<br>
<br>
If combined with the B-rank Leaping Shadow Evasion this technique
increases LSE's Stamina cost by (5*X), which replaces Phantom Step's
normal Stamina cost.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Chouyaku Kage Kaihi no Jutsu - Leaping Shadow Evasion Technique
)--<br>
You leap away from an attack, getting yourself safely out of range.
However, you don't pause to regain your orientation and settle into
your new position, instead keeping ready to move again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you use Chouyaku Kage Kaihi, make a dodge roll. You may
automatically attempt to dodge any incoming attacks, without having to
take an action to do so, using Chouyaku Kage Kaihi's result as your
effective dodge roll. This lasts until you take any action, including
defensive interrupts.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Rankyaku - Storm Kick )--<br>
Using this technique a shinobi kicks with extreme precision, not aiming
at an opponent but instead kicking the air itself. Their leg slices
through the air with such speed and precision that it compresses the
air into a blade, aimed at the attack's target.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /6)d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: (STR/4) yards<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This cannot be parried (though ninjutsu-based defenses which work like
parries still function). Rankyaku causes Slashing wounds. The first
time this is used against a given opponent in battle it has a +2
Accuracy bonus.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Gouriki Senpuu - Strong Whirlwind )--<br>
Taking the Whirlwind back to the basics, the shinobi no longer bothers
with a series of strikes, and instead just focuses their ability into a
single roundhouse with more speed and power than the previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 32<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /6)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: STR/30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Daisenpuu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This damages everyone in range. If partial defense applies, this
technique does 50% of its normal damage per point it hits by, rather
than 20%. Anyone hit is knocked back STR/30 yards.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shougekishou - Upwards Attacking Palm )--<br>
A difficult attack to connect with, the shinobi brings their palm from
waist height and strikes upwards to full extension. This makes it
exceptionally difficult to connect with, though if the user does hit
they'll send their opponent flying away.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 34<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /6 +3)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 6<br>
<br>
Effects: <br>
If you are the attacker in a grapple, the Accuracy penalty is negated.
The grapple is ended if this technique hits.<br>
<br>
After being hit the opponent is knocked back (STR/10) yards and left
prone, as if they'd been hit with the E-rank Trip move.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Dai Dageki - Heavy Blow )--<br>
One of the simplest hand to hand maneuvers at the highest of levels,
this attack is straight and to the point. Sacrificing trickery or fancy
techniques, you deliver a powerful blow with the full weight of your
body behind it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 28<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As basic Attack (including Power Attack
and Unarmed Focus)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Your damage bonus is doubled for this attack.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Gouken - Iron Fist )--<br>
A generalized term for one school of thought for how to approach
taijutsu, the idea behind 'Iron Fist' is to give every attack one's
all, aiming to cause the maximum amount of damage in as few strikes as
possible. This often involves thrusting punches and short-range kicks,
and is undeniably effective. The downside, however, is that putting all
one's force into a single blow results in telegraphing one's motions to
an observant opponent, and can quickly tire the user.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: +X*2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -X/4 (round up)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: Special<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This supplements another Unarmed jutsu, or basic taijutsu attack. That
attack's base Speed (including for damage calculations) is increased by
X, and your Physical Damage Bonus is also increased by X.<br>
<br>
X has a maximum of STR/10.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Gawa-Ryuu - River Style )--<br>
The ultimate recourse of taijutsu fighters who are frustrated with only
being able to land glancing blows on their opponents, this technique
sends a surge of chakra through the attacking limb. This results in a
burst of speed and strength, and also a chakra 'shockwave' along the
edge of the attack that carries almost as much force as the strike
itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + X/2<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is activated after you hit with an Unarmed or Combo taijutsu
attack at melee range, but its damage is reduced by partial defense. X
is that technique's Stamina cost, after all modifications.<br>
<br>
When you activate River Style, your Accuracy with that attack is
retroactively increased by 2, or the minimum value to do full damage
(i.e. overcome partial defense), whichever is lower.<br>
<br>
Your opponent may spend Willpower on their defense after you've
declared activation of River Style. If you then spend Willpower on your
Accuracy, River Style's effects last until your attack has been fully
resolved.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Chishi Kakato Suto - Deadly Heel Strike )--<br>
Used as a killing blow, this technique is commonly performed upon a
prone opponent. Leaping into the air, the Shinobi comes down with a
full power downward heel strike, usually aiming to smash the ribcage,
crush a skull or even snap the spine.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 70<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR / 4)d20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 26<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This attack receives double your normal physical damage bonus. Its
Accuracy penalty is negated against a prone opponent.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Okasho - Cherry Blossom Impact )--<br>
Taking chakra infused muscles to the next level, the user focuses a
massive amount of chakra into their fist, foot, or even fingertip. Upon
striking the chakra is released into their target causing a great deal
of damage. Given that the damage is dependent on the amount of chakra
channeled, a truly great shinobi can even use this technique with a
single fingertip.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: X <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (X)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Chakra Strengthening, Chakra Control 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Okasho's Speed is multiplied by (your physical damage bonus) + (your
ninjutsu damage bonus)/2, rather than just your physical damage bonus.
You may give this technique an Area of (X/4), though doing so reduces
its damage to (X)d6.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shigan - Finger Gun )--<br>
Using a single finger, the Shinobi strikes with speed and precision to
drive their finger into an opponents body. There is a danger in the
technique as an inaccurate strike can easily damage the user.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR / 4)d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Bleed 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Shigan's damage is tripled for the purpose of inflicting wounds, and
deals Piercing damage. <br>
<br>
If partial defense applies when Shigan hits, the attacker takes half
the damage they rolled. Although Shigan cannot wound its user this way,
they also suffer a Sprained Arm (Blunt, Major) wound as a result.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Benkei-do - Way of Benkei )--<br>
A mixture of folk hero and mythical character, Benkei was a warrior
monk known for his peerless skill in combat and unswerving loyalty to
his master. One of the popular stories about his exploits involved
Benkei guarding a bridge, holding back hundreds of warriors before
finally succumbing to his wounds. This technique pays homage to his
exploits, focusing all a shinobi's efforts on defense.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +0<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may activate Way of Benkei alongside a normal defense. Until your
next action, your defenses have a (+1+X) bonus, with X being the number
of times you've attempted to defend yourself (successfully or
otherwise) since activating Way of Benkei (including the defense it was
activated with). You may choose not to use Way of Benkei on a given
defense; doing so does not reset its X value or require it to be
reactivated.<br>
<br>
The only defenses which &amp;quot;count&amp;quot; for Way of
Benkei are dodges and unarmed parries. You may use other defenses, but
they do not receive its bonus or increase its X value.<br>
<br>
Way of Benkei ends when your take a non-Interrupt action, at which
point you pay a secondary Stamina cost of 10+3*X, to a maximum of 40.
You may declare Block, Total Defense, Guard, and similar effects
without ending Way of Benkei.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Asahi Kyusho - Rising Sun Strike )--<br>
A very impressive, though somewhat impractical, technique, the user
gathers energy in one limb (typically a leg, though open-palm attacks
are possible) and relases it in a single, swift strike with enough
force to send their opponent flying. Though not technically required,
it is suggested that anyone performing this technique shout its name
emphatically when doing so.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, the injuries from this technique come less from the
initial impact and more from the landing, which is very rarely
graceful. Thankfully, the victims of this technique have their dignity
spared--they're usually knocked too far away for anyone to see them
wind up in a face-down heap after rolling through the dirt!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 30 + X/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /4) d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20, Delay X<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This knocks the target back STR/4 * (its Speed, after any reductions
/20) + (Delay)*(your Physical Damage Bonus)/2 yards.<br>
<br>
However, when Rising Sun Strike hits, make an Athletics roll with a -10
penalty, and a +X bonus, against your opponent's Athletics. If their
roll is greater than yours, the distance they're knocked back is
halved. For every 5 points they beat your roll by, increase the divisor
by 1 (to /3 at 5, /4 at 10, and so on).<br>
<br>
Additionally, if they are knocked back more than (their RES)/3 yards,
they lose an amount of AP equal to their current AP, divided by the
same amount as the knockback was (someone with current 30 AP who
divided the knockback by 4 would lose 7 AP).<br>
<br>
Rising Sun Strike's damage is considered Y% higher for causing wounds,
where Y is the number of yards is target was knocked
back.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>

### --( Rendan - Combo )--<br>
Not so much a proper technique as a catch-all term for any series of
attacks made in rapid succession, without breaking one's flow or
allowing an opponent time to retreat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 1d6<br>

### --( Yaburi Yashi - Smashing Palm )--<br>
A single, staggeringly powerful open-palmed blow delivered at the end
of a combo, aimed at the opponent's midsection to strike their solar
plexus.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 3d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Finisher<br>
<br>
Combo Bonus: +2 Stun<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is an automatic called shot to the abdomen. If it's blocked, the
Stun is halved.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Gekido Denka - Furious Charge )--<br>
The basis of combos in battle is maintaining one's momentum, striking
one blow before the opponent's fully recovered from the one before it.
In many cases, all one needs is a few seconds to get away from their
opponent and catch their breath to escape an otherwise merciless
beating.<br>
<br>
You, however, just love to beat people mercilessly. Though it's taxing,
you can keep your adrenaline up, and keep your blows coming rapidly and
rhythmically, even after being forced to chase after your victims.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
So long as you maintain Furious Charge, taking Move actions will not
break your combos. Using movement-based jutsu (such as Shunshin),
however, will.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>

### --( Shishi Danmaku - Lion Barrage )--<br>
A popular way to end the similarly-named combo-assault, the Lion
Barrage was is often taught to students along with Lion Combo itself.
Advanced taijutsu users, however, have been known to appreciate the
flexibility and fluidity that comes from separating the techniques.<br>
<br>
The Lion Barrage is simply a series of fast, strong fist and knee
strikes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 6d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Finisher<br>
<br>
Combos Bonus: +2d8 damage<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Hangeki Rendan - Counter Combo )--<br>
Exploiting a momentary break in your opponent's attacks, you turn the
tables on them! It's very exciting, and stuff.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You and your opponent both make Accuracy rolls. If your result is
higher, you immediately break their combo, and execute any combo jutsu
you know, with a starting combo counter equal to whatever your
opponent's was when you used this technique.<br>
<br>
If you fail, your opponent may immediately use any combo they know
against you, as a Speed 0 Interrupt.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Rakurai Heishi - Lightning Warrior )--<br>
Conventional wisdom says that one must prioritize speed or power,
having to choose between one or the other. You reject that, striking
both quickly and decisively. Of course, that means you have to pay the
price elsewhere: fighting like this will rapidly wear a person out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
While Rakurai Heishi is maintained, any time a combo you are performing
would be broken you may choose to increase this technique's Upkeep by
2; when you do so, your combo is not broken.<br>
<br>
If your combo is broken, Lightning Warrior's Upkeep is reset to 0. If
you stop maintaining Lightning Warrior, your current combo is
automatically broken. Rakurai Heishi cannot be used if your combo is
broken because you performed a Finisher or a Move action.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Bunka-ken - Splintering Fist )--<br>
A powerful blow that smashes through defenses. Your attack carries
almost concussive force behind it, enough to overcome all but the most
resilient of enemies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Finisher<br>
<br>
Combo Bonus: Ignore 5 points of DR.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is applied as an addition to an Unarmed Taijutsu technique,
increasing its Stamina and Speed accordingly and turning it into a
Finisher. The increased Speed does not improve the technique's
damage.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Hasu Rendan - Lotus Combo )--<br>
The user of this technique launches into a sequence of strikes designed
to alternately wind, disorient, and daze their opponent, combining
those effects to prevent their adversary from fighting back effectively
for as long as possible.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Opener. This action's Speed may not be
reduced.<br>
<br>
Combo Counter: +2d10 damage, +2 Stamina, +1 Accuracy<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Each time Lotus is used sequentially (with no other attacks between
uses), its base Speed increases by 2, its Stamina cost is raised by 4,
and it gives an additional 1 Combo Count. This stacks; the fourth Lotus
in a sequence would be Speed (4+2*3) 10, give (1 + 1*3) 4 Combo
Counters, and have a Stamina cost of 22 (before Combo Counter effects).<br>
<br>
Additionally, Lotus Combo can extend existing stuns. If a target hit by
Lotus Combo is Stunned, the duration of that Stun is increased by X*2,
with X being the length of the current Lotus sequence. Thus, hitting
someone with four Lotus Combos in a row would extend their stun by
(2+4+6+8) 20.<br>
<br>

### --( Hokuto no Ken - Fist of the North Star )--<br>
Delivering a precise, rapid, and powerful series of blows to vital
points on an opponent's body, this causes their blood vessels to
spontaneously rupture, resulting in both internal hemorrhaging and
dramatic external bleeding, sometimes even resulting in a brief spray
of blood immediately after its use.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 7d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Finisher<br>
<br>
Combo Bonus: +1d10 damage, +1 Bleed<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Even if Hokuto no Ken is parried, it still inflicts its Bleed.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Aragami no Jutsu - God of Battle Technique )--<br>
Rather than waiting for your opponents to give you openings and then
capitalizing upon them, you make openings. When that doesn't work, you
break through your opponent's defenses anyway, attacking even when it
seems fruitless, until finally something gives.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Whenever you hit with a technique that raises your Combo Counter, your
Combo Counter increases by 1 more, and Aragami's Upkeep also increases
by 2. When your combo is broken, Aragami's Upkeep is reset to 0.<br>
<br>
If you end Aragami, your Combo Counter is immediately set to 0.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Mouretsu Tora no Jutsu - Furious Tiger Technique )--<br>
You break off your combo with an abrupt transition back into more
traditional taijutsu techniques, taking advantages of the momentum and
rhythm you've built up to deliver one devastating blow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: +10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Finisher<br>
<br>
Combo Bonus: +0.5 Accuracy, +5% damage<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This finisher is used by combining it with an Unarmed Taijutsu attack,
increasing its Stamina cost appropriately. The Combo Bonuses are
applied to that technique, modifying it appropriately.<br>
<br>
The increased Speed from using Furious Tiger does not improve the
technique's damage.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Akuma no Isoi - Devil's Rush )--<br>
A technique that requires extreme speed and toughness, and a
considerable disregard for one's own health. Most shinobi learn
first-hand in the academy what 'chakra burns' are: burns, typically
found on the hands (where chakra is typically focused), caused by
poorly forcing too much of one's chakra through their body's
&amp;quot;chakra pores&amp;quot;.<br>
<br>
This technique takes a common mistake among academy students and
weaponizes it, forcibly overwhelming one's own chakra circulatory
system in the arms and hands, superheating their body. That, combined
with the high-speed blows delivered by this technique, results in what
appear to be literally flaming punches.<br>
<br>
This can actually be delivered in kicks as well, and the general
consensus is that a 'burning' leg is more visually impressive. Most
ninja, however, prefer punches, because they hate fun.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d6.open(6)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Combo Counter: +1d6 damage, +1 Ignite<br>
<br>
Effect: <br>
If an enemy passes a Resistance roll against your Athletics, the
severity of the ignite they're inflicted with is halved. Whether or not
you hit, you yourself suffer Burns with a severity equal to Akuma no
Isoi's Ignite.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Taiyou Douyou no Jutsu - Solar Agitation Technique )--<br>
For once, the name actually has a basis in reality! This technique is a
single, devastating blow to the opponent's solar plexus, knocking the
wind from their lungs and temporarily debilitating them in the
aftermath.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 8d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Finisher<br>
<br>
Combo Bonus: +3 Stun, +1 to enemy's Stamina penalty, +1d12 damage<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This has an additional feature if used against an opponent who was
performing handseals. If the total Stun from Solar Agitation is greater
than the Speed of their Perform Handseals action, the victim
automatically Aborts their Perform Handseals action (as if they had
failed the Chakra Control roll against the attack's damage dealt).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Senkagami no Jutsu - God of War Technique )--<br>
The greatest of hand-to-hand combatants are able to dispatch enemies
one after another in the midst of battle, their momentum never lagging,
their blows not showing the slightest hint of hesitation.<br>
<br>
If you've mastered this technique, you are officially one of them!
Congratulations!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +0<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is used alongside a Finisher. Using that Finisher does not end
your combo; instead, your Combo Counter is halved, but you may continue
your combo, make another finisher, or so forth. If your Finisher missed
and you activated Senkagami, your Combo Counter does not decrease at
all.<br>
<br>
After using a finisher with Senkagami applied, you gain an Upkeep of 5
from Senkagami; each subsequent use increases Senkagami's Upkeep by 5
(10 after the second use, 15 afte the third, and so forth). When your
combo is broken, Senkagami's Upkeep ends; similarly, if you end
Senkagami's Upkeep, your combo ends automatically.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>

<br>
# Grappling Jutsu<br>
## E-rank<br>
### --( Grab )--<br>
You grab onto an opponent, with the intent to not let go! It's not a
preferred method of fighting among ninja, but it does have some limited
popularity amongst certain taijutsu fighters.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 8 if it misses, 12 if it hits<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: None<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You are grappling your opponent. This is not inherently a huge
advantage, but leads in to multiple other possibilities for attack.<br>
<br>
When grappled, the following effects apply to both participants:<br>
&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; Their movement
speed is halved, and moves the other person along with them.<br>
&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; If you try to
move, the other person may attempt to restrain you; if they do, your
AGI is reduced by half their STR when calculating how far you can move.<br>
&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; The Dodge and
Parry interrupt both have their Speed increased by 2.<br>
&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt;&nbsp; Other
Grapple jutsu may be used. Grapple jutsu cannot be defended against
normally (i.e. dodging, blocking). Ordinary attacks, such as punching
or stabbing the other grappler, can be defended against normally.<br>
&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; The attacker
cannot use handseals without the Single-Handed Seals unique.<br>
&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; If either person
is suffering from the Ignite status, both people take damage from it.
If both are on fire, only the more severe Ignite deals damage.<br>
<br>
Certain situations within a grapple may call for a 'grapple check'.
This varies depending on whether you are the attacker or defender.<br>
Attacker: 1d20 + STR/10 + DEX/20<br>
Defender: 1d20 + STR/10 + AGI/20<br>
<br>
The person who initiated the grapple is considered the 'attacker', and
may end it at will, at any time; the person who was grabbed is the
'defender', and may not.<br>
<br>
Unless specified otherwise, all Grapple Jutsu may only be used by the
attacker. However, the defender has two options (beyond normal actions
and attacks) available to them:<br>
<br>
Shift Grapple (Speed 5, Stamina 5)<br>
The attack and defender both roll grapple checks; if the defender
exceeds the attacker's roll, they are the new attacker in the grapple.
When this is done, the attacker also has to roll a Stamina 5 check.<br>
<br>
Break Grapple (Speed 4)<br>
The attack and defender both roll grapple checks; if the defender
matches or exceeds the attacker's roll, the grapple ends immediately.
When this is done, the attacker must roll a Stamina 5 check, or choose
to simply let go.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Escape Grapple )--<br>
Being held in place by one person and then punched into submission by
all their friends is a pretty exceptionally undignified way for a ninja
to go down. Accordingly, ninja are usually taught the basics of how to
writhe their way out of all manner of holds.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 4 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4 + X, Delay X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Grapple-only.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Roll a grapple check against your opponent. The
&amp;quot;X&amp;quot; in this jutsu's cost and speed is the
amount you fail your grapple check by.<br>
<br>
Thus, if you rolled a 12 against your opponent's 16, Escape Grapple
would be a Stamina 8 check and have a Speed of 8. On the other hand, if
you passed your check by 36 points, it would be only Stamina 4 and
Speed 4.<br>
<br>
This technique cannot be Aborted, despite its Delay.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Headbutt )--<br>
You use your head to hit someone else's head. Really, honestly, it's a
highly technical process. You just don't understand because you're not
a ninja.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 3d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 7<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Grapple-only<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This attack may be used by either the attacker or the defender in the
grapple, but only against the other person. It automatically hits. If
it causes a wound, that wound is automatically a head wound.<br>
<br>
Although the attacker does not take damage from doing this, if the
damage they do would have caused them to be wounded, they will suffer
that wound. For example, if you have 500 Vitality and Headbutt someone
for 60 damage, you would take 0 damage and suffer a minor wound (for
taking more than 10% of your HP in one hit).&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Throw )--<br>
You use leverage, brute force, or a combination of the two to
physically throw an enemy, either by flipping them over you, hurling
them into a nearby object, slamming them to the ground, or something
similar.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8, or +4<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This immediately ends the grapple, and Stuns the enemy, severity 4.
This can also be declared as part of a Grab attack, in which case it
increases the total Speed by 4, and deals damage as a Speed 16 action.
It cannot be blocked when used this way. The two Stamina rolls (one for
a grab, and one for Throwing if the grab succeeds) are made separately.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Arm Lock )--<br>
You use one of your hands or arms to pin an opponent's in a position
where they can't use it effectively. It's a bit harder than it sounds,
just because of the logistics of grappling people effectively.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You and your opponent both lose the ability to use one of your arms.
This puts your opponent at a -1 immobilization penalty, applies a -2
penalty to their grapple rolls, and doubles the Seal Speed of any jutsu
they try to use.<br>
<br>
Using this jutsu a second time doubles the penalties and makes it
impossible for the victim to use handseals at all.<br>
<br>
If you lose control of the grapple, these effects end.<br>
<br>
A person with the Single-Handed Seals unique is able to perform
handseals one-handed unhindered by these effects.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Leg Lock )--<br>
You hook one of your legs around an opponent's, restricting their
mobility at the price of your own.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You and your opponent both lose the ability to use one of your legs.
This gives your opponent a -2 penalty both to immobilization and to
their grapple checks, as well as further halving the speed at which you
and they can move in the grapple.<br>
<br>
With both their legs locked, the penalties double and neither you nor
they can move at all.<br>
<br>
If you lose control of the grapple, these effects end.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Head Lock )--<br>
You get behind an opponent and put an arm around their neck. For what's
a fairly simple-seeming maneuver, this is actually highly effective: to
avoid breaking their own neck, they have to limit their mobility.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You lose the ability to use one of your arms, and your opponent suffers
a -4 immobilization penalty, as well as a -2 penalty to all their
grapple rolls. For the duration of the headlock, the victim's Stamina
rolls have a -4 penalty. Additionally, any jutsu or effects that
require them to aim with their mouth (such as breathing fire or
spitting out needles) have a -5 strike penalty.<br>
<br>
If you lose control of the grapple, these effects end.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Choke Hold )--<br>
You grab your opponent's neck and cut off either the flow of blood to
their brain, or of oxygen to their lungs. Either way, it's a nasty
thing to be affected by... though as far as combat between ninjas go,
it's one of the more effective and less violent ones.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You lose the ability to use one of your arms while maintaining this
hold. Every use of this technique applies a stacking -1 Suffocation
penalty to your opponent. So long as this hold is maintained (meaning
you don't use the arm holding them for anything else, and remain in
control of the grapple) the suffocation effect does not end.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Reversal )--<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 4, +X if successful<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 3 + Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This can interrupt the use of any grapple move other than Headbutt or
Pressure Point while you're the defender, as long as you know that
jutsu yourself. Make a grapple roll against the attacker; if you
succeed you gain control of the grapple and automatically use the move
they were going to; the 'X' in Reversal's Stamina cost is that move's
Stamina.<br>
<br>
Reversal's Speed is 3 if it fails, and for the purpose of determining
what it can interrupt. If it succeeds, you also add half the Speed of
the move you reversed.<br>
<br>
______________________&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Counter Throw )--<br>
You throw an enemy who's grabbing you off, freeing yourself from them
and injuring them in the process.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 8 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4 + X, Delay X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Throw<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This ends a grapple when used, but may only be used by the defender.
The attacker is Thrown (as per the D-rank Throw move, including the
stun). Counter Throw always deals damage as if it was Speed 10,
regardless of the actual speed.<br>
<br>
When you declare use of Counter Throw, make an opposed Grapple check.
The amount you fail by is the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; in this
move's Stamina cost and Speed. If you pass, it's Stamina 8 / Speed 4 /
Delay 0.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Joint Lock )--<br>
You grab your opponent in such a way that you can put continual strain
on one of their limbs or joints. Though typically non-lethal, an expert
grappler can be brutal with these techniques.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Basic unarmed attack.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Must have the opponent in an Arm Lock
or Leg Lock.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
To use this technique you must have your opponent in an arm or leg
lock; if you have multiple limbs locked, declare which one you are
targeting. Any wounds dealt by the joint lock are applied to that limb.<br>
<br>
Although the damage is dealt normally, it is considered cumulatively
25% higher each time you use the technique. For example, the first
Joint Lock you apply does unarmed damage +25%; the next, unarmed damage
+50%; the third +75%, and so forth, and so on.<br>
<br>
If you take an action other than maintaining the joint lock (including
moving or using interrupts), this cumulative increase is reset.<br>
<br>
Joint Lock does benefit from Unarmed Focus and Power Focus, if you have
those abilities, though its Stamina cost is increased appropriately (up
to 18 for four ranks of Power Attack).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Pressure Point )--<br>
You find, grab, and press down on an opponent's pressure point,
temporarily immobilizing them; these are painful while maintained, but
more to the point (ahaha, get it, because they're... never mind) it
prevents the nerves you're isolating from working properly while the
pressure is maintained.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10 + X*4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Medicine 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may be used to Interrupt any grapple move used by the defender,
other than Headbutt or Break Grapple checks (Shift Grapple and Escape
Grapple are fair game). You quickly find a pressure point on their body
and immobilize it, preventing them from completing whatever they were
attempting.<br>
<br>
This requires an arm free; you may release a lock, if necessary, as
part of this interrupt, to free up your hand. Roll an opposed grapple
check, applying no penalties from holds or locks. If you are
successful, they are prevented from taking their action.<br>
<br>
Against Escape Grapple or Counter Throw (or any techniques with similar
variable effects), the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; value the user
pays for their failed technique is half the amount you beat their roll
by.<br>
<br>
For Pressure Point's cost, X is the number of times you've used
Pressure Point in that battle--making it 10 the first time, 12 the
second, and so on.<br>
<br>
______________________ <br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Compression Hold )--<br>
A less brutal alternative to joint locking (which has this nasty
tendency to tear people apart), a compression hold is still
exceptionally painful--that's the point. You twist the victim's body in
such a way that their own joints are being used to hurt them--forcing
their elbow to press against their sternum is a popular one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 3<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This requires the opponent already be in one of the three D-rank locks.
Each time you use this technique applies a -1 penalty to their grapple
checks, so long as that lock is maintained. This penalty remains until
that lock is ended.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suplex )--<br>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex<br>
Just... read that, okay? That's what you do to them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 13<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 6d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This ends the grapple. If Suplex inflicts a wound, it is dealt to the
opponent's head.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Kurokumaken - Black Bear Strength )--<br>
A devastating move, developed by a shinobi who claimed he had gained
inspiration for it by watching the fighting tactics of wild bears. The
user wraps their arms around their opponent and squeezes with
incredible strength. Users of this move have been known to crack arm
bones and break ribs.<br>
<br>
It was later pointed out that real bears do not actually hug people, to
death or otherwise. The original inventor of the move refused to
comment, and the name was in wide use by that point anyway.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 10d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Compression Hold<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If this causes a wound, that wound is applied to the torso and both
arms. Additionally, your damage bonus is doubled for calculating the
damage of this move. Kurokumaken requires the use of both arms.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
### --( Ryuorosu - Dragon Takedown )--<br>
Adapted--in purpose, method, and name--from a 'normal' style of martial
arts, the Dragon Takedown is a more aggressive method of initiating a
grapple, often throwing an opponent to the ground in the process.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/5)d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may be used outside of a grapple; in fact, it may only be used
outside of a grapple. If you hit, you deal damage (which is not
unblockable) and you initiate a grapple with your opponent and may
immediately apply any of the D-rank locks or a choke hold.<br>
<br>

### --( Tora Rakka - Tiger Drop )--<br>
You flip your opponent over you and hurl them to the ground (or
otherwise maneuver them unpleasantly if you're both already on the
ground) and slam an elbow, knee, or other body part into them, using
gravity to assist your momentum.<br>
<br>
Nobody really knows what this has to do with tigers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/5)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you use this technique, make an opposed grapple check. If the
opponent fails, they are Stunned (10). If you fail, you are instead
Stunned for that amount; if you succeed, you are still Stunned (4).
This technique ends the grapple.<br>

### --( Hijutsu: Full Nelson - Secret Technique: Full Nelson )--<br>
A special technique passed down through generations, the true origin of
the Full Nelson is unknown, but its efficiency is dreaded; many a
shinobi has thought victory assured, only to be trapped by a well-timed
Full Nelson.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You must use both your arms to keep your opponent in this hold. So long
as you do so, they have a -8 immobilization penalty and a -8 penalty to
their grapple rolls. This ends if you lose control of the
grapple.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Shishi Keishi - Lion Execution )--<br>
This move was supposedly developed by a martial arts master who was
tackled and mauled by a lion. He somehow survived, though horribly
maimed; it's said that because nobody could recognize him after the
attack, he became known as the &amp;quot;Faceless
Master.&amp;quot; He devised this technique based on what he
learned from being tackled and mauled by a lion, to imitate the effects
of the victim being tackled and mauled by a lion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: X + 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: X + 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Dragon Takedown<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Shishi Keishi is performed from outside of a grapple. If this technique
misses, the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; value is not paid. When
performing Shishi Keishi, declare any grapple move of B rank or below;
if it hits, you initiate a grapple and then immediately perform that
move. &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; is the cost and speed of the move
you are using with Shishi Keishi.<br>

### --( Garuda Tsuiraku no Jutsu - Crashing Garuda Technique )--<br>
The Crashing Garuda is not, at a glance, all that different from a
regular flip-your-opponent-over-a-shoulder throw. What makes it
different, and what makes it take arduous practice to perfect, is the
precise way the user manipulates their opponent and strains their
muscles. The Crashing Garuda is a study in kinesiology--the user lifts
the opponent overhead and swings them down, bringing themselves
crashing along with the foe in a way that multiplies the force brought
to bear by both muscles and gravity.<br>
<br>
Too long? Didn't read? The short version: You don't want to have this
used against you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 28<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 16d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18, Delay 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Tora Rakka<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Make a grapple check. The amount you succeed by is added to this
technique's Speed for the purpose of determining its damage, the
opponent is Stunned for half that amount, and you are Stunned for one
quarter that amount. If you fail, you still pay the Stamina cost and
expend the full Speed, but the attack fails.<br>
<br>

### --( Washitsume no Jutsu - Eagle Talon Technique&nbsp; )--<br>
The pinnacle of ways to brutally maim your opponents when you already
have them at your mercy in battle, Washitsume is yet another move named
after animals for no clear reason other than martial artists (and
ninjas) seeming to think that's cool.<br>
<br>
The principle is simple: You hyperextend a limb or joint while twisting
it in whatever way will put the most excessive amount of strain on the
bones, muscles, and tendons. It's quite possible for this to cause
irreparable damage, and it has seen some use as an improvised torture
method.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10 + X * 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Basic unarmed damage.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8 + X * 2<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You must have your opponent in a joint lock for the limb you are
attacking. After reductions are applied, this attack's actual damage is
halved. However, for the purpose of causing wounds its original damage
is multiplied by X, up to a maximum of 6. The X*2 is not included when
calculating your damage bonus from Speed.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
# Weapon Jutsu<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Kousanami - Cross Wave )--<br>
A simple but elegant technique, the user brings their weapon up in a
sequence of diagonal slashes.&nbsp; It gets its name from the
rising swings and the figure-eight motion which is both efficient and
simple to perform.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon + 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15 + (weapon's Speed)/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Sword or Slashing<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Cross Wave has only a single Accuracy, and is treated as one attack.
However, if the opponent uses a defense where they roll for a result
(such as dodge or parry), they must roll twice.<br>
<br>
If the attack hits the first defense, that roll is used to determine
how much partial defense, if any, is applied. If the second defense
also fails (partial defense being ignored for this purpose), your
attack's dice damage is tripled (from, for example, 5d8 to 5d8*3).<br>
<br>
If the attack misses against your opponent's first defensive roll, make
the second roll. If it hits, this attack deals damage as a regular
attack with your weapons (with the higher Speed associated with this
technique).<br>
<br>
If you are using a two-handed weapon (such as a nodachi or zanbato),
which would normally multiply your damage bonus by 50%, you do not
receive that increase when using Cross Wave. For example, if you had a
damage bonus of 10, normally a two-handed sword would use 15; for Cross
Wave, however, it would use the normal 10.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Nenten Tsuki - Twisting Stab )--<br>
The user lunges forward while turning their wrist, drilling their
weapon into the opponent, using chakra to enhance their
momentum.&nbsp; It is very effective at breaking an opponent's
guard as you spin the weapon to go around their defense.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12 + (Weapon's Speed)/5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Piercing<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique reduces the effectiveness of blocking by an additional
25% (for a total of&nbsp; 50%, for attacking with a weapon). If you
miss completely, the Speed is increased by 3, as you lunge and lose
your balance.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kashiwa no Hishou - Oak Flight )--<br>
Circling something large and blunt over your head, you slam it into
your opponent after a few rotations and completely daze them. A
powerful enough strike put in the right place makes it hard for the
enemy to focus on you, or even gives them a bit of double-vision.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Blunt<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Every 50 damage dealt by this technique gives the victim a -1 penalty
to Accuracy which lasts until their next attack or accuracy roll.<br>
<br>
If you deal more than 400 damage, for 50 IC whenever they attack any
single target they must roll 1d2; on 1, their attack functions
normally. On 2, they have a -5 Accuracy penalty due to disorientation
and double vision.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Haganekabe - Steel Wall )--<br>
By spinning their weapon rapidly with both hands, the user deflects
ranged attacks aimed at them as they close in on their opponents, and
then use the momentum gained by the rotation to finish with a powerful
swing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon +6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon -2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Polearm, Umbrella<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you use this technique, you begin spinning your weapon; so long as
you keep doing this you may parry incoming ranged attacks as a Speed 0
Interrupt with a +5 bonus, but both your hands and your weapon are
occupied. Anyone attempting to attack you in melee has their action's
Speed increased by 4, as they need to get around your polearm.<br>
<br>
When in melee range of someone, you may end this technique's upkeep and
pay its cost and Speed again to use it as an attack, with +3 Accuracy.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Ichi no Hoshi - One Star )--<br>
By unfolding their fan only a third of the way, the user creates a
small but biting gust of wind that is useful for its capacity to strike
at targets far away while wielding a weapon.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type:&nbsp; Fan<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This uses your ninjutsu damage bonus, rather than your physical damage
bonus.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fukumikuchi Hari - Hidden Mouth Needles )--<br>
The user is able to summon needles from within their mouth and spit
them at their opponents with force comparative to have been
thrown.&nbsp; It's useful at point-blank range for catching the
opponent by surprise, but becomes predictable with repeated use.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As senbon multi-throw, +3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10, +X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As senbon multi-throw<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As senbon multi-throw, -2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Senbon<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This allows you to perform a multi-throw with senbon, following normal
multi-throw rules, even without the ability which would normally allow
you to do so. If you can multi-throw senbon without using this jutsu,
it instead becomes an automatic Surprise Attack.<br>
<br>
X is the number of times you have previously used this technique in the
same battle.<br>
<br>
Though this jutsu can be used as often as you wish, it may only be used
as a Surprise Attack once every 100 IC; after that, it's just not
surprising.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kage Shuriken no Jutsu - Shadow Shuriken Technique )--<br>
The user throws multiple Shuriken at the same time, positioning them in
such a way that one or more weapons can hide within the shadow of
another in flight, making the lower one(s) virtually invisible.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon(s)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type:&nbsp; Large Ranged Weapon<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You throw two of the same weapon, each doing their normal base damage,
and using half this technique's Speed to determine how much they
benefit from your damage bonus.<br>
<br>
If this hits and partial defense does not apply, combine the damage of
the two weapons. If it hits and partial defense does apply, one misses
entirely and the other does full damage (not reduced by partial
defense).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Mukadesuto - Centipede Strike )--<br>
Using two weapons in conjunction with one another, the user strikes
repeatedly, flowing from one strike to the next in a barrage of attacks
that can quickly overwhelm most opponents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Dual-Wield Attack, +3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Dual-Wield Attack<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Dual-Wield Attack +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Dual<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Each time this attack is consecutively used (even if it misses!) the
total Speed of the attack is reduced by 1, to a minimum of half its
original value. Additionally, the number of dice on each weapon is
increased by 1.<br>
<br>
These benefits reset if you make a non-Interrupt action other than a
dual-wielded attack with your weapons or movement, or if you go for 15
IC or more without using this jutsu.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kusari no Hebi - Chain Serpent )--<br>
With sufficient practice, the user can throw their chain weapon in such
a way that it ricochets to strike their opponent multiple times,
hitting and disarming them or tripping them at the same time, tugging
on the chain to redirect it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Chain Weapon<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If this hits, in addition to dealing damage you may either attempt to
perform the E-rank taijutsu technique Trip or disarm a weapon they're
holding. The Stamina costs and Speds of these actions are included in
this technique.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Omo Hoshiga - Double Star Fang ) --<br>
Several enemies running at an archer and getting in close could mean
the end for an archer, but luckily you can fend them off! Quickly
drawing several arrows out, you load them all into your bow and fire
them off in different directions. This would be hard for most people,
but luckily you're a ninja. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: (As Weapon) + 5 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: (As Weapon) + 3 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Bow<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may target up to three additional people with this attack; X is the
number of people beyond the first who you attack.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
_________________<br>
<br>
### --( Soushuriken no Jutsu - Manipulated Shuriken Technique )--<br>
You connect a thin, nearly invisible wire to shuriken or kunai when
throwing them so that you can redirect them mid-air, or even attack
people around corners or behind trees!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon +3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapons<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon +3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Small Thrown Weapons<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Ninja Wire<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If you miss with this technique you can make an Accuracy roll with a +4
bonus; if this hits, your attack hits but uses only half your damage
bonus.<br>
<br>
You can also attack a person who you don't have line of sight on (say,
they're around a corner) if you can somehow accurately perceive them;
in this case the above paragraph does not apply and this technique has
a -2 Accuracy penalty.<br>
<br>
Used with a multi-throw attack, this increases the total Stamina and
Speed of that action by the appropriate amount. The increase in damage
bonus from multi-throwing (+0.5 per weapon thrown) is also halved by
this technique if the Accuracy roll is used.<br>
<br>
The total of Ninja Wire required is the range at which you make this
attack, multiplied by the number of weapons thrown. This does not need
to be prepared in advance; you do it on the spot and use precisely the
right amount of wire, via your ninja trickery.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Hirameku Yaiba - Flash Blade )--<br>
Using the principles of Iaijutsu, the user takes up a neutral stance
and, using a surge of chakra, rushes their opponent to take them by
surprise, redrawing the weapon and striking in one quick movement.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Sword<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Make an Initiative roll, opposed by your opponent's; they have a
cumulative +2 bonus for each time you've used this (successfully or
not) in this battle. If you fail, you perform a regular sword attack.<br>
<br>
If you succeed, your attack receives the benefits of the Iaijutsu
ability, even if you've used that earlier in battle.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Hamukau Kanjin - Vital Strike )--<br>
Whether it be to cut someone's achilles tendon, or to lop their head
off, blades have many ways to disable or execute their wielder's
opponents. Sneaking into your opponents defenses and getting in even
one good attack can change a fight, or end a life!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: +8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Slashing weapon<br>
<br>
Effects: &nbsp;<br>
You may give yourself a penalty of up to -(STR/10) Accuracy. For every
-1, this attack's damage is increased by 10% for the purposes of
inflicting wounds.<br>
<br>
Even without any penalty, partial defenses are ineffective against this
attack, and it is an automatic called shot (without the usual called
shot penalty).<br>
<br>
__________________<br>
<br>
### --( Mawarisuto - Rotation Strike )--<br>
Extending out a polearm, you hold one end with both hands then commence
whirling and spinning the polearm around yourself in large circles! If
it has a blade of some sort, this is even better!!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon +10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Polearm<br>
<br>
Effects: &nbsp;<br>
You may attack anyone you choose within range 3. If you choose to
target only one person with this attack it has +2 Accuracy.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Raikogeki - Thundering Strike )--<br>
Drawing your weapon back and then lunging out quickly, you make a
precise strike aiming to injure, hopefully cause them to bleed out a
bit. Despite the slightly weakened nature of this strike, it's rather
unnerving to be poked full of holes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon -5 (Minimum 3)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Piercing Weapon<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts Bleed 1. If used again while the opponent is still
suffering from that status, this instead increases the Bleed's severity
by 1.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kashiraheki - Headsplitter )--<br>
Hoisting your weapon into the perfect position, taking your time to
figure out the perfect swing, you bring it across directly into your
target, or perhaps from above, with disastrous results! Unfortunately,
while this may be perfect for exploding someone's brains out, it's
pretty obvious you ar .getting ready to do just that!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon +10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Delay: As Weapon +3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Blunt Weapon<br>
<br>
Effects: &nbsp;<br>
This technique counts as 10 Speed higher if you miss with it. <br>
<br>
Its total damage (dice + speed*damage bonus) is multiplied by 2. If
used with a two-handed weapn, the increased damage bonus for holding it
in both hands has a maximum of *1.5 (this will normally only be
relevant if performing Headsplitter with a Tetsubo).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Motsure Muchi - Entangling Lash )--<br>
Instead of using the chain to strike at people from range and then reel
the weapon back to the user, they disable their opponent with the
length of chain, preventing them from moving at the expense of losing
use of their weapon.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Chain Weapon<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may use your weapon to grab ahold of someone, as per the E-rank
Grapple technique. You use your DEX in place of your STR for grapple
checks using the whip. Your opponent is considering to be 'grabbing'
the whip. Although they cannot attack it, if they gain control they may
automatically disarm you. The victim may shift or break the grapple as
normal.<br>
<br>
You may perform any valid Grapple techniques which you know of D-rank
or lower, using your DEX in place of your STR. Yoou may not perform the
Headbutt or Suplex techniques.<br>
<br>
While being used in a grapple, your whip cannot be used to attack or
with other jutsu.<br>
<br>
__________________<br>

### --( Ni no Hoshi - Two Star )--<br>
Opening the fan two-thirds of the way for this attack, the user lets
out a strong gust of wind, hopefully blowing their opponents away!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Fan<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This uses your ninjutsu damage bonus, plus half your physical damage
bonus.<br>
<br>
__________________<br>
<br>
### --( Jouro Senbon - Raining Needles )--<br>
This technique requires an umbrella and a plethora of needles! Filling
them all into tiny spring-loaded compartments, they all fire out as the
umbrella is thrown into the air, spinning. The user helps direct the
needles with their chakra, though only enough to make sure the needles
spread out well or hit their targets.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapons<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Needles, Umbrella (Set up beforehand)<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Your umbrella is launched into the air, where it remains stationary.
When first launched, and every 10 IC afterwards, for 50 IC, the
umbrella showers the area with needles. You may selectively choose
who's targeted by this technique with each volley, allowing you to
exclude your allies.<br>
<br>
Each 'needle shower' is a senbon multi-throw, up to the max number of
senbon you can multi-throw (which is 1 without the appropriate
ability). You must load the full number of senbon this technique will
use into it ahead of time; if it runs out of needles early, it stops.<br>
<br>
For example, if the umbrella was firing 5 needles per 'shower', at 4
targets, you'd need a total of 5*4*6 = 120 needles loaded in the
umbrella to make the full 6 attacks (one inititally, then 5 over the
next 50 IC).<br>
<br>
Targets may defend against these attacks as if they're Speed 12. For
the purpose of damage calculations, however, they multiply your damage
bonus by (the Speed you performed Jouro Senbon at)/6, rounded down.<br>
<br>
This selectively targets all your enemies in range. The senbon from
this technique do 20% more damage for every previous volley from that
umbrella the victim was hit by. Thus, if you hit with the initial rain
of needles, then twice more, then missed once, if the volley on IC 40
would deal +60% damage if it hit that same target.<br>
<br>
<br>
This technique uses your base Accuracy for an C-rank Weapon Taijutsu,
unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though
penalties from Fatigue do apply. It uses your physical damage bonus at
the time you initially launched the umbrella. You receive the benefits
of your Weapon Focus: Umbrella or Weapon Focus: Senbon, whichever is
higher. Because the attacks are made by the umbrella, and not you, you
cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP).<br>
<br>

### --( Nenshou Hoshi Shuriken - Burning Star Shuriken )--<br>
Taking a large throw weapon, you slap several explosive tags onto it
and huck it at your enemies! Pretty simple, and pretty awesome!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon +10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon + Tags<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon + 4 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Large Thrown Weapon<br>
<br>
Effects: &nbsp;<br>
You may attach up to 3 Exploding Tags to the weapon; X is the number of
tags you attach. When making the attack, you also declare a Delay for
the tags to explode, which can be anywhere between 10 and 10+(Chakra
Control skill ranks) IC. This explosion is centered on the location the
target was when this attack was made, occurs whether the attack hit or
missed, and follows all normal rules (damage, valid defenses, etc.) for
the class of explosive tags used.<br>

### --( Itowotoosu - Thread the Needle )--<br>
Attaching Ninja Wire to the end of an arrow, the shinobi fires and uses
chakra to alter the course of the arrow in mid-flight. This makes the
shot extremely hard to avoid, at the cost of living a wire leading back
to the point of origin.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon+8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon +8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Bow<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Every 10 yards you are from the opponent when firing adds +1 to the
Accuracy of this attack. Using this technique expends an amount of
ninja wire equal to the distance between you and its target. After this
attack is resolved, you are automatically removed from stealth (if you
were hidden to begin with).<br>

### --( Chakura Nagashi - Chakra Flow )--<br>
A technique which increases the potency of a weapon by running currents
of chakra through it to enhance its existing properties or adapt it to
a situation. The user must remain in physical contact with the weapon
to sustain the flow of chakra, making this only effective with melee
weapons.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Chakra Control 15, appropriate
Elemental Aptitude<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Melee<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
While you maintain this technique, your weapons gain the properties of
your elemental affinity. When used against ninjutsu-based defenses, the
weapon is considered to be of the relevant element to determine how
effective the defense is against it. Additionally, it gains an
additional effect based on the element chosen (listed below). This
technique does receive your bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls from the
Elemental Affinity ability.<br>
<br>
If you're using Dual Weapons, Chakra Flow applies to both of them;
otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Chakra Flow at a time. Any
weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from your Chakra
Flow. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one
receives Chakra Flow's effects as a Speed 0 action.<br>
<br>
<br>
Earth: Your weapon gains Stun 2, or +2 to its existing Stun. Every time
somebody already stunned is struck by your weapon, their Stun is
increased by 1. Anyone who parries your weapon successfully suffers the
Stun 2 (or +1).<br>
<br>
Fire: You add one third of your ninjutsu damage bonus to your regular
damage bonus when using your weapon. To determine damage you multiply
your attack's damage by its base speed, rather than modified speed.<br>
<br>
Lightning: Any weapon that parries yours, or which yours parries, has a
cumulative 10% chance of breaking and becoming unusable each time. Any
damage reduction an opponent has is halved, and you ignore the effects
of any armor they're wearing.<br>
<br>
Water: Your chakra can momentary liquify your weapon's physical
structure, allowing it to pass straight through anything in its way; it
can't be parried by other weapons. Additionally, water's inherent
fluidity and adaptability give you +2 Accuracy, and an additional +2
when parrying.<br>
<br>
Wind: The efficacy of blocking is reduced by 25%, and your damage is
considered 15% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds upon your
enemies. If you're successfully parried by another weapon, your attack
still does 50% damage; this does not trigger any secondary effects of
your attack (like status effects, such as Bleed).<br>
<br>
<br>
This is complicated slightly when two weapons augmented by Chakra Flow
interact, one parrying or being parried by the other. In these cases,
if one of the elements is strong against the other, the weaker
element's Chakra Flow effects are ignored for the purpose of that parry.<br>
As a reminder: Fire beats Wind; Wind beats Lightning; Lightning beats
Earth; Earth beats Water; and Water beats Fire.<br>
This doesn't apply if the parry fails (if your Water weapon fails to
parry their Fire sword, it still does that extra damage to you), but in
the case of Earth vs. Water, does allow an Earth weapon to attempt to
parry a Water one.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have an advanced elemental chakra nature (such as a Senju's
Mokuton), you choose which of the two appropriate effects you're using
when you activated Chakra Flow. For example, as a Senju you could
receive either Earth's stunning or Water's accuracy and parry effects.
You cannot change which you've chosen without ending and then
re-activating Chakra Flow.<br>
<br>
Despite this, it's still considered to be the advanced element when put
up against ninjutsu defenses.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Hashadan - Blade Breaker )--<br>
You deliver an overwhelmingly powerful blow, often an overhead strike,
with all the force you can muster behind it; what it gains in force it
loses in precision, but its real purpose is to destroy any weapons used
by the victim for defense.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: +10 or +X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Melee, not Small<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is used alongside any other attack with the weapon, including
weapon taijutsu. If the attack is successfully parried or blocked by a
weapon, the defender makes a Stamina roll. The normal +5 bonus to
Stanina rolls per level of Fatigue is replaced with a -3 penalty (so
someone at Fatigue 3 would have a -9 penalty, instead of a +15 bonus).<br>
<br>
The result of their roll becomes the X added to your attack's cost.
Thus, if you used Blade Breaker with a Katana (Stamina 12), and your
opponent parried your attack and rolled a 14 on their Stamina roll, the
total Stamina cost would be (12+14) 26. The weapon used to defend
against your attack is destroyed.<br>
<br>
If your attack is not (successfully) blocked or parried, its Stamina
cost is increased by 10 instead. If it is, but the enemy's weapon
cannot be destroyed for any reason, the Stamina cost is increased only
by 5.<br>
<br>
This will destroy weapons created by Water-Cutting Blade and
Earth-Smashing Staff, but not Burning Spear. The destruction of the
enemy weapon takes place after their defense is resolved (breaking the
sword which parried your attack does not prevent your attack from
having been parried).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Houfuku - Retaliation )--<br>
A highly effective maneuver, the user deflects an opponent's weapon
with their blade and then follows through with the motion, using their
existing momentum to launch a swift slash or jab at their assailant.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10 + (Weapon)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (Weapon)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: (Weapon)/3, rounded down<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Sword<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is activated after successfully parrying a weapon with your sword.
You may immediately make a basic weapon attack against the person whose
attack you parried, using your normal Accuracy. This uses a third of
your weapon's normal Speed, rounded down; before AP and similar
effects, Retaliation's Speed may not go below 4.<br>
<br>
Due to their speed, Retaliation attacks cannot benefit from the damage
bonus multiplication of holding a weapon two-handed. Attempting to
parry an attack made with Retaliation has a -4 penalty. You may not
move as part of this attack.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Chakura Nagashi Shuusei - Chakra Flow Modification )--<br>
Converting one's chakra to an element other than their affinity is
difficult; doing so with chakra flow is even more so, as it requires
converting your chakra to the desired element, then reabsorbing it in a
continuous stream.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Chakra Control 25, Chakra Flow<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Melee<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
As the C-rank Chakra Flow, but you may use elements other than your
affinity. You may only maintain one element of Chakra Flow at a time,
even if you're holding two weapons.<br>
<br>
You must be able to use ninjutsu of the appropriate element in order to
infuse your weapons with that element of chakra.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Hien - Flying Swallow )--<br>
This technique expands upon the concepts developed when learning the
Chakra Flow technique. Instead of altering the nature of chakra flowing
through their weapon, the shinobi changes the shape. This is used to
expand the striking or cutting surfaces of the weapon with an invisible
chakra blade, point, or blunt end.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Chakra Control 20, Chakra Flow<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Melee<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The range at which your melee weapon can be used increases by 1 (in
most cases meaning that you can make melee attacks from 1 yard away,
instead of 0 yards), and its damage is increased by 2 dice. This does
mean that your weapon no longer triggers most on-contact effects.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you gain a +3 Accuracy bonus with the weapon against
anyone who is unable to see chakra (which usually means Hyuuga and
Uchiha only). Whenever you strike an opponent, make a Chakra Control
skill roll against their Espionage. If they match or beat your roll,
the Accuracy bonus is reduced to +1 for the remainder of the fight.<br>
<br>
If you're using Dual Weapons, Flying Swallow applies to both of them;
otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Flying Swallow at a time. Any
weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Flying Swallow.
If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this
technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Tsubasa Migaku - Blade Honing )--<br>
Despite being a fairly simple technique in concept, the precision
necessary to perform it effectively, and without damaging one's blade,
limits its use to more skilled shinobi. Focusing chakra along the edge
of a bladed weapon, the user creates a 'second', sharper blade of
chakra that essentially increases the weapon's sharpness, and also
protects the blade itself from dulling.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: X/2 (round up)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Slashing<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Your weapon deals X extra dice of damage, but its damage is reduced by
(X*5)% for the purpose of determining wounds. X has a maximum of (your
Chakra Control skill ranks)/3.<br>
<br>
If you're using Dual Weapons, Blade Honing applies to both of them;
otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Blade Honing at a time. Any
weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Blade Honing. If
holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this
technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Ryuuketsu Ibara - Bloody Thorns )--<br>
This technique coats the tip of a piercing weapon with a thin layer of
chakra which reacts to puncturing a victim's flesh. When it does so,
the chakra immediately forms a number of small thorns which tear the
victim's flesh when the weapon is pulled out. The 'spikes' then return
to being nothing but formless chakra, ready for the next attack.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Piercing<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Your weapon inflicts Bleed 1 whenever it deals damage. If the victim
has an existing Bleed status, it increases that status by 1. This
explicitly stacks with the C-rank Thundering Strike (meaning it's Bleed
2, or +2, if paired with Thundering Strike).<br>
<br>
If you're using Dual Weapons, Bloody Thorns applies to both of them;
otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Bloody Thorns at a time. Any
weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Bloody Thorns.
If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this
technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Haruichiban - First Storm of Spring )--<br>
The user of this technique throws multiple oversized shuriken in quick
succession, pausing just long enough between each throw to correct for
their opponent's movements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 14 + X * 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: ( (4 + STR/12) * X)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: STR/3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12 + X * 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Large Thrown<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You throw X Fuuma Shuriken or Large Star Shuriken, up to a maximum of
STR/35 (May never exceed 4); all the weapons you throw must be of the
same type. If this hits normally, its damage is increased by 5% per
point it hits by (if Fuuma Shuriken were used), or 10% per point it
hits by (if Large Star Shuriken were used); this is then reduced by
partial defense normally.<br>
<br>
If Haruichiban misses, lower X by 1, its Speed by an additional 4, and
raise its Accuracy by 3. Repeat this until Haruichiban hits or X is 0.<br>
<br>
This effect does not alter Haruichiban's Stamina cost, or what its
Speed is for determining when your next action comes (in other words:
it lowers the number of dice rolled, and the Speed for damage
calculations, only).<br>
<br>
Partial defense is less effective than normal against Haruichiban; for
each point it hits by, it deals 25% of its full damage.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Tentai-ite no Jutsu - Celestial Archer Technique )--<br>
Every once in a while a shinobi gets it into their head that it would
be a good idea to use a bow as their primary method of fighting. This
rarely ends well, but the shinobi flair for the dramatic is often
powerful enough to override both their good judgement, and any good
advice they may receive. This technique was developed by those sorts of
shinobi, in an attempt to make their weapon of choice less painfully
impractical.<br>
<br>
The user concentrates chakra in their arms, speeding up their draw
speed and allowing them to subconsciously correct their aim in an
instant. The downside is that they sacrifice a great deal of power when
doing this--but, as many users of it will assert, the technique is
&amp;quot;way too awesome&amp;quot; for that to be a serious
concern.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2 + X/3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 2 ranks in Weapon Focus: Bow<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Bow<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
While you maintain this technique's Upkeep, your bow's Accuracy penalty
is reduced by X. If X is set higher than the value of your bow's
Accuracy penalty (for example, you set X = 10 and are using a Yumi),
consider X to be just enough to eliminate the penalty for this
technique's other effects.<br>
<br>
The base Speed of your bow is reduced by X/2, and the number of dice of
damage it rolls is reduced by X. Your damage bonus when using your bow,
after being multiplied as appropriate for the weapon you're using, is
also reduced by X. Your damage bonus or number of dice cannot be
reduced to 0 or lower; if they would, you are incapable of maintaining
Celestial Archer at that level.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Gen'ei Tousekiki - Phantom Ballista )--<br>
A distant derivative of the ubiquitous chakra flow technique, this
concentrates chakra around the user's wrists and forearms. When an
arrow is drawn back in a bow that chakra extends to wrap around it, and
lingers long enough after being fired to strengthen the impact. More
ambitious users can even form arrows out of pure chakra, though doing
so rapidly puts a strain on their reserves.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 8 or 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Chakra Control 20, Chakra Flow<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Bow<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
While this technique is maintained, your arrows deal an extra (CHA/12)
dice of damage. For the purposes of ninjutsu-based defenses they are
treated as being a ninjutsu attack of your elemental affinity (Upkeep
8) or any element you have the ability to use (Upkeep 12), declared
when you activate this technique. If you use your elemental affinity,
the Chakra roll does receive the appropriate bonus.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you may create arrows out of pure chakra. Attacking with
these arrows replaces your bow's normal Stamina cost with an equivalent
Chakra cost +5 (a Daikyu, Stamina 20, would become Chakra 25). These
deal (CHA/8) dice of damage, and use (ninjutsu damage bonus + physical
damage bonus)/2 in place of your normal physical damage bonus. These
arrows use d12 for their damage if used with a Daikyu, or d6 with a
Yumi.<br>
<br>
These arrows have a faint glow about them until they hit, a result of
the chakra enhancing them. This tends to draw attention. When attacking
from Stealth with Phantom Ballista (either a normal arrow, or one
created from chakra) your Stealth TN is reduced by 7 (rather than
5).&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Mikazuki no Mai - Crescent Moon Dance )--<br>
Originally developed in Konoha, the technique has since been imitated
and reconstructed in other villages. The user attacks at high speed,
using a pair of clones to attack the target's blind spots; this
actually consists of several strikes in quick succession, the user
changing location after each and losing themselves among their clones.
Understandably, this makes an effective defense against the technique
difficult to come up with.<br>
<br>
Ideally, this technique is performed using Shadow Clones; other
varieties of clones work, though are less effective, and in a pinch a
ninja can briefly create the necessary clones as part of the technique,
though doing so is draining on their chakra, and the clones disappear
immediately afterwards.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 30 + (Weapon)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Four times the normal amount of dice
rolled by your weapon.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30 - 15 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Delay: 15 - 5 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Sword<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
X is the number of Shadow Clones you have armed with weapons which can
be used with this technique, up to a maximum of 2. Crescent Moon Dance
is always considered a surprise attack, and defending against it must
be done as if it was half its actual Speed (if you used 5 AP to reduce
it to Speed 15, it would count as Speed 8; this would require a Speed 4
or lower Interrupt to defend against Crescent Moon Dance).<br>
<br>
Clones used with this technique must have the same weapon you do and be
capable of attacking and dealing damage. If you have two or more such
clones that aren't shadow clones (such a Rock or Water Clones), X is
considered to be 1; X cannot go above without using actual Shadow
Clones.<br>
<br>
Attempting to parry Crescent Moon Dance requires the defender to roll
2d20.takeLowest(1) in place of 1d20. Ninjutsu-based defenses do not
suffer from this limitation. Crescent Moon Dance cannot benefit from
Iaijutsu (or, as a result, Flash Blade), and the wounds it deals are
reduced by one category.<br>
<br>
Crescent Moon Dance may not have its Speed reduced below its Delay.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Ansatsu no Jutsu - Assassination Technique )--<br>
A simple name for what is, at its heart, a simple technique: the user
crosses to their target and strikes a killing blow in less time than it
takes for a human to blink. If successful, they'll strike a vital,
unprotected location on their foe's body, and in an instant seal that
person's fate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As weapon.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Shunshin no Jutsu<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Small<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may only be used as a Sneak Attack. Performing Ansatsu no Jutsu
includes an activation of Shunshin, which must be used to move you into
melee range directly behind your target (normal movement as part of an
attack is not permitted).<br>
<br>
This attack bypasses armor and halves damage reduction. Its damage is
multiplied by 5 after all reductions are applied, and it inflicts
wounds of one category higher than normal. If partial defense does not
apply, it instead inflicts wounds of two categories higher than normal.<br>
<br>
Ansatsu no Jutsu's Speed may not be reduced, and for the purposes of
determining damage it uses the base Speed of the weapon it was
performed with (rather than the technique's own Speed). However, for
every 2 AP you spend when performing it you may reduce its effective
Speed, for the purpose of determining valid defenses, by 1, to a
minimum of 4.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kadou Kikan - Vortex Engine )--<br>
Spinning their fan like a staff user would, this doesn't create an
impenetrable defense, instead the fan is twisted to use all that force
to create massive wind gusts. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (Weapon's damage) *4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Fan<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When this technique is activated, everyone in front of you, in a
tunnel-shaped space ten yards wide, can choose to either take damage
from this technique. or be knocked back CHA/6 yards. This requires no
Accuracy; it cannot be dodged, or parried by ninjutsu. Defenses which
work without a roll (such as Earth Shore Return) do function against it.<br>
<br>
This effect occurs again every 5 IC so long as you maintain the Upkeep.
Each time after the first, the divisor on your CHA for the range (but
not the distance knocked back) is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of CHA/1,
25 IC after you begin Vortex Engine), and the Speed is considered 1
higher for the purposes of determining damage.<br>
<br>
While this technique's Upkeep is maintained you may take no other
actions, including Interrupts. The Stamina cost is paid only way in
it's initially activated. If you use AP to reduce the Speed of the
initial activation, the Speed of the damage dealt every 5 IC afterwards
is similarly reduced.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Tenya no Jutsu - Heavenly Arrow Technique )--<br>
The natural evolution of Phantom Ballista, this technique wreathes any
arrows the user fires in elemental chakra, and leaves streamers of
light in their wake for several seconds. To the delight of the more
pragmatic ninja out there, the increase in power provided by this
technique closely mirrors its improved aesthetics.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30 or +15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: +6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8 or +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Phantom Ballista<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Bow<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may be used while Phantom Ballista is already active (Chakra 30)
or when you use Phantom Ballista (increasing that technique's Chakra
cost by 15). It increases Phantom Ballista's Upkeep appropriately.
Heavenly Arrow adds a different effect to your bow depending on which
element you've chosen to use, as listed below. This applies both to
normal arrows enhanced by Phantom Ballista, and chakra arrows created
with that technique.<br>
<br>
If used on its own (activated separately from Phantom Ballista),
Heavenly Arrow's Chakra roll receives the bonus from your Elemental
Affinity ability if you're using the appropriate element.<br>
<br>
This technique does have a noticeable downside: the afterglow of chakra
left in your arrow's wake, while quite pretty, gives any enemies a
pretty good idea of exactly where you are. If you attack from Stealth
while using Heavenly Arrow, your Stealth TN is reduced by 10 (instead
of 5). This replaces the similar effect in Phantom Ballista.<br>
<br>
Earth: Your arrows inflict a Stun equal to the number of dice added by
Phantom Ballista.<br>
<br>
Fire: Your arrows inflict Burns equal to half the number of dice added
by Phantom Ballista, and an Ignite equal to (the number of dice
added)/3.<br>
<br>
Lightning: Your arrows bypass Damage Reduction. If they are faced with
a ninjutsu defense which stops damage (such as Earth Shore Return), so
long as they break through their damage is not reduced at all (but if
they are stopped, they are still stopped fully). Partial defenses from
ninjutsu defenses does not apply to your arrows.<br>
<br>
Water: If your attack misses you may immediately roll accuracy, with a
+4 bonus, replacing your original accuracy with the result.<br>
<br>
Wind: +2 Accuracy. If the arrow is dodged or parried, or partial
defenses applies against either of those defenses, the victim is still
wounded as if they'd taken the attack's full damage (a piercing wound
if partial defense applied, or slashing if they avoided it entirely)
unless they succeeded by 6 points or more.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have an advanced elemental chakra nature (such as a Senju's
Mokuton), you choose which of the two appropriate effects you're using
when you activate Heavenly Arrow. For example, as a Senju you could
receive either Earth's stunning or Water's accuracy roll. You cannot
change which you've chosen without ending and then re-activating
Heavenly Arrow.<br>
<br>
Despite this, it's still considered to be the advanced element when put
up against ninjutsu defenses.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Sanjuu Hayate - Three-fold Gale )--<br>
With this technique, three shots are fired in rapid succession. With
each arrow fired, the archer takes note of the effects of drag and wind
speed, as well as their opponent's reaction, and compensates before
launching the next arrow. In addition to requiring an incredible degree
of focus, this technique is quite taxing to perform.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon *3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon+15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Bow<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This attack consists of three separate shots. When you attack make
three Accuracy rolls, the first as normal, the second with a +2 bonus,
and the third with a +4 bonus. The opponent makes a single defense
against this attack, unless they're parrying (not including
ninjutsu-based defenses), in which case they must defend against each
one with a separate parry roll and action.<br>
<br>
Each arrow multiplies your damage bonus by half of Sanjuu Hayate's
Speed, but rolls its full amount of dice. The damage of these shots is
combined when damage reduction is applied and to determine wounds
inflicted.<br>
<br>
If you have aimed your bow ahead of time (taking an Aim action, as
described in the bows themselves), that Accuracy bonus applies only to
the first of Threefold Gale's rolls.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

====================<br>
1. Requirements<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Learning ninjutsu is a great deal of work; a ninja has to learn how to
mold their chakra, how to convert it to the right elemental nature,
then how to properly project it, along with memorizing all the
necessary handseals... for each individual jutsu they know.<br>
<br>
There are three ways you can qualify to learn ninjutsu of a given rank.<br>
<br>
The first is Chakra Control skill ranks: With sufficient control over
your chakra it becomes easier to mold it efficiently, and mold the vast
amounts of chakra used in higher-end techniques with the appropriate
precision.<br>
<br>
Next is Research skill ranks. You can make up for poor chakra control
by knowing how chakra behaves even when you can't control it, and
understanding what they technique is trying to accomplish.<br>
<br>
Finally, character rank. Once you have enough pull in your village, you
can bother the right people to teach you how to use techniques without
getting brushed off for wasting their time.<br>
<br>
You need to meet any one of those requirements for a given jutsu rank
to learn those jutsu. They are listed... below.<br>
<br>
##### Rank:<br>
###### E: Genin<br>
###### C: Chuunin, Special Jounin<br>
###### B: Jounin<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
##### Chakra Control:<br>
###### D: 5<br>
###### C: 15<br>
###### B: 25<br>
###### A: 35<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
##### Research:<br>
###### D: 5<br>
###### C: 12<br>
###### B: 22<br>
###### A: 32<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Special Rules<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ### a.&nbsp; Earth<br>
In the rare situation that there is no earth available (such as on a
boat), these jutsu are pretty useless. A few may remain usable (if, for
example, they involve you regurgitating huge amounts of mud, instead of
manipulating the environment), but most will not.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ### b.&nbsp; Fire<br>
If you ever find yourself completely submerged in water, Katon jutsu
won't work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ### c.&nbsp; Lightning<br>
Nothing out of the ordinary here! This is chakra-based electricity, not
real electricity, so it has no special ability to, say, electrocute
everyone in contact with water, or anything like that.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ### d.&nbsp; Water<br>
Water is at a disadvantage among elemental jutsu in that it requires
raw material to use (earth techniques do as well, but it's rare to find
oneself in a situation without ground). Accordingly, most water jutsu
require some amount of 'gallons of water' to be performed, listed as a
Requirement.<br>
<br>
This water has to come from somewhere. Unless the fight is taking place
is near a river (a small stream won't cut it) or a lake, or, say, on a
boat, it's not going to be from the environment.<br>
<br>
There are two ways to bring water into a battle where there otherwise
is none: the first is to physically carry it, typically in a large
gourd (see the Equipment chapter). The other is the C-rank Water
Creation Technique.<br>
<br>
Used water is typically scattered across the battlefield, meaning it
cannot be used in a technique--it is 'lost'. However, the E-rank Water
Gathering Technique allows you to reuse this 'lost' water--if you're
going to be using Suiton Ninjutsu, learn it!<br>
<br>
You can't use water someone else is carrying into battle, but water in
the environment is fair game.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ### e.&nbsp; Wind<br>
Blocking reduces the damage of Wind techniques by only 25%.<br>
<br>
A rare form of combat is using a fan to perform fuuton jutsu. It's not
without its advantages: using the fan you can rapidly manipulate wind
and infuse it with chakra, removing the seal speed from the technique
you're using. However, doing this can be tiring, and as such it adds a
Stamina roll with a difficulty of 5 + (half the technique's Chakra
cost), made at the same time as the normal Chakra roll.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Fuuinjutsu<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Fuuinjutsu, or sealing techniques, are, as the name suggests,
techniques which use chakra to form specialized 'seals'.&nbsp;
They're difficult to use, and have limited combat viability.<br>
<br>
What makes them useful is that these seals are stable. Normally, any
sort of chakra-based effect will expire soon after its user stops
applying chakra to it, the energy dissipating back into the world.
Seals don't, and depending on the individual seal and the skill of the
user some can last for decades if left undisturbed.<br>
<br>
The downside is, they're counterintuitive and complicated.<br>
<br>
To learn fuuinjutsu, you have to meet all the requirements listed for a
given rank.<br>
<br>
######&nbsp; D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Research<br>
###### C: 12 Chakra Control, 15 Research, Seal Training (talent)<br>
###### B: 20 Chakra Control, 25 Research, Seal Training (talent)<br>
###### A: 30 Chakra Control, 35 Research, Advanced Seal Training
(ability)<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Medical Ninjutsu<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
One of the few good things the development of ways to control chakra
has brought to the world is the appropriately named medical ninjutsu.
These are techniques which safely transfer chakra to another person, or
use it to accelerate the natural healing process, cure maladies, and
otherwise ameliorate suffering and avoid unnecessary casualties.<br>
<br>
Medical ninjutsu also has a darker side. The pioneers in the field
learned the secrets of the human body so that they could help people,
but more than a handful of infamous missing ninja of the past have
found ways to weaponize it, or worse.<br>
<br>
Unless otherwise specified in their descriptions, you may not use any
medical jutsu on yourself. For the sake of quick reference, the jutsu a
medic may perform on themself are: Vital Repair, Tourniquet Technique,
Temporary Suture, and Mystical Palm.<br>
<br>
If any Medical Ninjutsu technique has a listed Upkeep, that Upkeep is
paid by the recipient of the technique, rather than the medic; this
represents the medic adjusting the flows of that person's chakra to
preserve their health. This does mean that those techniques can be
voluntarily (or forcibly) ended, though the
&amp;quot;Dazed&amp;quot; Wound will specifically not do so.<br>
<br>
You must meet all listed requirements to learn medical ninjutsu of a
given rank.<br>
<br>
###### D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Medicine, Medical Training (talent)<br>
###### C: 10 Chakra Control, 15 Medicine, Medical Training (talent)<br>
###### B: 20 Chakra Control, 25 Medicine, Advanced Medical Training
(ability)<br>
###### A: 30 Chakra Control, 35 Medicine, Advanced Medical Training
(ability)&lt;/text&gt;<br>

<br>
# General Ninjutsu<br>
## E-rank<br>
### --( Bunshin no Jutsu - Clone Technique )--<br>
One of the three basic ninja techniques, this creates one or more
intangible copies of the user. These are nothing but weak constructs of
chakra, and cannot interact with the world around them--though they can
speak.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + 3 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6 + 1 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4 + 1 per clone<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may create up to 3 clones. During this process you can 'hide' among
your clones, making it impossible to tell which one is the fake. Any
targeting you must roll 1d(1 + number of clones). On a roll of 1, it
targets you; on anything else, it aims at a clone; clones cannot dodge,
parry, or use jutsu. A clone that's been hit is destroyed; if you're
hit, your clones remain but are mostly useless (as you've been
identified by your opponents). If you make new clones (of the same
type, or a different variety), all your pre-existing ones are
immediately destroyed.<br>
<br>
Several other actions related to this jutsu are significant.<br>
<br>
Hide Among Clones (Speed 4, or Speed +6)<br>
You pull off a quick shell-game maneuver, confusing your opponents. If
they've singled you out from your clones, and you're free to maneuver,
you may do this to hide yourself. You roll Stealth against their
Awareness skill; success means you've once again concealed yourself.
Doing this alone is a Speed 4 action, but it may also be used with
another action (such as an attack) by increasing that action's Speed by
6.<br>
<br>
Observe (Speed 4)<br>
Anyone can try to observe you and your clones to try and find a
discrepancy, such as the clones not casting shadows or not leaving
footprints behind. This allows them to make an Awareness roll against
your Chakra Control; if they succeed, they can tell you apart from all
your clones, and recognize those clones as such, until you hide among
them again.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Henge no Jutsu - Transformation Technique )--<br>
This technique is as common as it is basic, yet to the ordinary
civilian it's one of the most mysterious and feared capabilities ninja
possess: the power to take the shape of another person.<br>
<br>
With this jutsu a ninja can alter their appearance to match that of
another person or object. If used to transform into anything but
another human, it only lets you take on the thing's shape and basic
physical characteristics: turning into a rock wouldn't make you nearly
invulnerable, turning into a bird would not let you fly, and while you
could transform into a particularly large shuriken your 'edges' would
be too dull to cut with--in the last case, however, you would be fairly
aerodynamic.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You look like another person. At a glance, this is nearly flawless. Of
course, the technique has many weaknesses: if you don't know about,
say, a birthmark, then your Henge wouldn't reproduce it.<br>
<br>
If someone interacts with you and knows the person you're trying to
imitate, they have an opposed Espionage roll (with a +5 bonus; +10 if
it's someone they know exceptionally well, such as a sibling or loved
one) against yours to see through the Henge.<br>
<br>
Beyond just that roll, there are ways a Henge can automatically be seen
through--not knowing a password, or saying something the person you're
trying to imitate would never say.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, you could just Henge into someone other than
yourself.<br>
<br>
If you try to turn into some piece of scenery, any ninja who come
within 10 yards of you have a chance to notice the deception; you have
an Espionage roll with a +10 bonus against their Awareness to remain
concealed.<br>
<br>
Any time you take damage, your Henge effect ends immediately; it's just
an inherent flaw in the technique.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kawarimi no Jutsu - Substitution Technique )--<br>
The final of the three basic ninja techniques--along with Bunshin and
Henge--is the substitution technique, allowing a ninja to move so
quickly they cannot be seen by the naked eye and replace themselves
with a wooden log (don't ask where the wooden logs come from) or other
harmless object.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique is activated after you have failed to dodge an attack,
but the damage would be reduced by partial defense. In the case of
non-damaging techniques, this can be used whenever it hits by 5 points
or less. As long as the dodge's new Speed (including the +4 from
Substitution, and its Seal Speed) would still be valid for interrupting
(you may spend AP to reduce Kawarimi's Speed, as usual, but may not
reduce the original dodge's speed at this point), you can pay 5 AP to
fully dodge that attack.<br>
<br>
Each time you use Kawarimi, its AP cost is increased by 5 for the rest
of that battle. The second time you used Kawarimi would cost 10 AP, the
third would cost 15 AP, and so forth.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
If Kawarimi's Seal Speed is reduced to 0, you can perform it without
handseals.<br>
<br>
After successful use of Kawarimi, you may immediately attempt to Hide.
Doing so has a cumulative -2 penalty each time after that you use
Kawarimi to do this in a single battle. Used this way, your opponent is
allowed an immediate Awareness roll against your Stealth TN (though
this does not apply to the cumulative bonus they would get for
searching for you).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Ninshiki Kaado - Ninja Info Cards )--<br>
This jutsu uses specially prepared cards capable of being encoded with
chakra. Although the cards appear blank, anyone familiar with this
technique will be able to identify them.<br>
<br>
The cards themselves are a trivial purchase (no cost or equipment entry
associated with them). When chakra is applied to them (via use of this
jutsu) they can be encoded with hidden information. This information
can be retrieved the same way, but only by the person who stored the
information to begin with.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 7<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Performing this technique requires a surface to rest the cards on as
they are encoded, one at a time, with chakra. Essentially any kind of
information (images, graphs, maps, text) can be placed on the cards,
though their size is a limiting factor.<br>
<br>
Since these can't be used to pass messages, they typically see more
mundane uses--like storing one's grocery list.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Genjutsu Kai - Genjutsu Release )--<br>
The most common and perhaps most effective method of combatting
genjutsu, if one ends up caught up in one and aware enough to realize
it.&nbsp; Kai involves temporarily stopping the flow of chakra
throughout the body, and then sending a burst to the brain in an
attempt to force the attacker's chakra from their body. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 5<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This can be done on yourself, or someone else, but you must be able to
touch the other person when performing the jutsu.&nbsp; This allows
the person it's used on to make another roll against a Genjutsu
affecting them, with a bonus of X. X has a limit of (5+XP/300).<br>
<br>
This may also be done against area-of-effect genjutsu, in which case
this technique's user makes a genjutsu roll against the original roll
made by whoever put the technique in place. If successful, the
technique is dispelled in its entirety.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shunshin no Jutsu - Body Flicker Technique )--<br>
A high-speed movement technique which allows the user to travel
incredibly distances in the blink of eye; used by a sufficiently
powerful ninja, this can be mistaken for teleportation by an untrained
observer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 2<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You move as far as you could in a Speed X move action, where X is how
many AP you choose to spend on this technique. There is no limit on how
many AP you may spend.<br>
<br>
You may use this in place of normal movement to help dodge an
area-of-effect technique. Use your AP spent, rather than the Speed of
the attack and your normal movement speed, to determine how close to
the edge of the effect you can get. This increases the Speed of your
dodge interrupt by 2.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kanashibari no Jutsu - Temporary Paralysis Technique )--<br>
This technique temporarily restrains the victim with chakra, as if they
were bound by invisible steel chains. Used effectively, it can
temporarily debilitate a target for a short period of time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 5, Paralysis 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique's Paralysis ends once its stun has expired. If used on
an already-stunned victim, the Paralysis lasts until they recover from
that stun.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Utsusemi no Jutsu - Cicada Shell Technique )--<br>
One of the oldest, most iconic techniques possessed by ninjas, in the
eyes of civilians. It's very useful for the ninja who are concerned
with acting &amp;quot;ninja-like&amp;quot;, as it allows a
shinobi to project their voice over an area while concealing their
presence. This means that a shinobi can talk to someone without giving
away their location, and can also be very unnerving.<br>
<br>
This isn't a megaphone, and it doesn't let you broadcast your voice
over entire towns. Your voice won't carry any farther than it normally
would, but it seems to be coming from all around.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
As described above, you can speak freely while hidden without giving
people any indication of where you might be hiding.<br>
<br>
Activating Utsusemi while in hiding does not break stealth (unlike
normal ninjutsu).<br>
<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Haruka Bakuhatsu no Jutsu - Remote Detonation Technique )--<br>
Explosives are useful; and, more importantly, who doesn't love
explosions? However, needing to be at ground zero of an impending
explosion to set tags off is something which many shinobi,
understandably, have reservations about, and severely diminishes the
potential tactical uses.<br>
<br>
Hence, this technique! It allows a shinobi to detonate multiple
exploding tags from a distance--not as great a distance as most would
like, or as many as most shinobi would prefer, but it's better than
doing it the old-fashioned way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X * 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/10 yards<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4 + X * 2<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You detonate up to (Chakra Control skill ranks)/5 exploding tags within
this technique's range. This only works on tags which you have primed.
X is the number of tags you detonate.<br>
<br>
When using this technique, you may select a delay between 10 and (10 +
Chakra Control skill ranks) IC--after that much time has passed, the
tags will explode, damaging anyone within their range as
usual.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>
### &gt;--( Sanzengarasu no Jutsu - Scattering One Thousand Crows
Technique )--<br>
This summons a flock of chakra-created and -guided crows which surround
and disorient them. The crows continuously multiply and clone
themselves, and will soon surround the target entirely.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 40 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 13<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts a -1 visibility penalty which increases every 10 IC until
reaching -10; 10 IC after that, it dissipates entirely. It can be
dodged.<br>
<br>
The application of an area-of-effect attack will destroy the crows, if
it actually hits this technique's victim.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kawara Shuriken - Roof Tile Shuriken )--<br>
This technique lifts up nearby roof tiles and launches them at an
opponent. The chakra used starts the tiles spinning and allows them to
be controlled remotely, in addition to making them far stronger than
normal roof tiles would be.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This requires you to be in a city or other area which has roofs (with
tiles).<br>
<br>
This is treated as a multi-throw, with the Chakra cost replacing the
Stamina cost. You may 'throw' up to CHA/10 roof tiles, which deal 2d10
damage each. The Speed is the normal Speed of a multi-throw launching
that many projectiles.<br>
<br>
This technique inflicts Blunt wounds.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Chakra Strengthening )--<br>
A fairly simple, yet often impractically demanding technique. The user
channels chakra into their limbs, increasing their speed and strength.
Despite being very good at what it does, it rapidly takes a toll on
one's energy reserves.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + 3 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You have a +X bonus to you your physical damage bonus and dodge while
you maintain Chakra Strengthening. X has a maximum of 5.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Soushuujin - Manipulating Attack Blades )--<br>
This technique allows the user to briefly levitate multiple kunai in
mid-air using chakra, and then direct them at an opponent, more quickly
than if each was being thrown individually.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4 + Special<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This supplements a multi-throw action. The Chakra cost is equal to the
multi-throw's Stamina cost; the Damage is that of the multi-throw,
though your ninjutsu, rather than physical, damage bonus is used. You
use CHA/10, rather than DEX/10, to determine how many kunai you may
throw.<br>
<br>
Because this technique essentially throws the projectiles in a straight
line, and lacks something in precision, it cannot be used with shuriken
(of any form) or senbon; only kunai.<br>
<br>
The Speed is 4, plus half the Speed of the regular multi-throw action.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kuchiyose no Jutsu - Summoning Technique )--<br>
One of the simplest techniques in the esoteric discipline of space-time
ninjutsu, the summoning technique allows a ninja--the summoner--to
transport creatures over great distances instantly.<br>
<br>
Most of these summons take the form of giant, intelligent animals.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: Varies<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: Varies<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: Varies<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Summoning Contract<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Even if you know this technique, you may not summon anything until you
have a contract with it. These are supernatural contracts with, as
mentioned above, supernatural animals.<br>
<br>
What you can summon, and what it does, depends on the nature of the
contract.<br>
<br>
These contracts are often known as &amp;quot;blood
contracts&amp;quot;, both because they're signed in blood, and
because performing Kuchiyose no Jutsu requires an offering of the
user's blood. It's not very much; a few drops will suffice, as long as
it's fresh. Some ninja will make a small cut on their arm or palm,
though dedicated summoners prefer the rather unsightly expedient of
biting themselves, often on the pad or back of their thumb, hard enough
to draw blood--summoning-focused shinobi can sometimes be identified by
the small, deep scars in those locations.<br>
<br>
If you have a summoning contract (usually obtained from the Summoning
Contract talent) you can learn Kuchiyose no Jutsu without meeting the
normal requirements to learn C-rank ninjutsu.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kikkake Bakuhatsu no Jutsu - Triggered Detonation Technique )--<br>
Explosives are, to say the least, useful. Unfortunately, their utility
as traps is severely limited by the fact that, normally, someone must
be nearby watching over them to have them explode when necessary.<br>
<br>
This technique allows tags to be set to detonate in advance, which both
makes them viable as traps and allows the shinobi who placed them to
attend to other matters.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + 5 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20 + X * 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You place X tags (up to a maximum of Chakra Control)/5. One or more (up
to 'all') of these tags may be designated as 'triggers'. When
performing this technique specify a range between 0 and (Chakra Control
ranks)/5 yards, and a time between 10 IC and 10 + (Chakra Control
ranks) IC.<br>
<br>
Whenever someone comes in that many yards of a trigger tag, all the
other tags it is linked with (by that usage of Triggered Detonation)
will detonate that many IC later.<br>
<br>
Tags placed with this technique may not be set off via Remote
Detonation, nor may they be part of more than one 'set' of Triggered
Detonation tags. All tags linked by a single usage of Triggered
Detonation must be within (Chakra Control ranks) yards of each
other.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## B-rank <br>
### --( Shoushagan no Jutsu - Vanishing Facial Copy Technique )--<br>
Developed for spying and infiltration, this technique is highly
effective, but grisly enough that most shinobi will deign not to even
learn how to perform it, regardless of its efficacy.<br>
<br>
With this technique, you steal the face off of a corpse and make it
your own.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You physically remove the face from a corpse and place it on top of
yours. The body in question must be recently deceased (within the past
24 hours) and not grievously mutilated (no Severe or higher Head
wounds).<br>
<br>
Your voice and skin tone will change to match that of the person whose
face you stole, but your height, build, and gender will not. The face
merges with your own seamlessly. Unlike henge, use of this technique is
completely undetectable by doujutsu and similar chakra-viewing effects.<br>
<br>
This can be maintained indefinitely, but a Major or worse Head wound of
any sort will cause the stolen face to tear, revealing (part of) your
own beneath it. Aside from being a fairly disturbing sight, this sort
of ruins the subterfuge aspects of the technique. At that point, your
face and skin tone return to normal.<br>
<br>
You may peel off and discard the face at will, ending this jutsu
whenever you please. A discarded face cannot be reused.<br>
<br>
Learning this techniques causes you to have a one-time increase of +10
Infamy.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Senri Bakuhatsu no Jutsu - Long-Range Detonation Technique )--<br>
An improvement to the more basic remote detonation technique. As ninja
become more powerful, they inevitably find themselves needing bigger
explosions, and by extension, the ability to not get caught in their
own explosions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + X * 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/5 yards<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6 + X * 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Remote Detonation Technique<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You detonate up to (Chakra Control skill rank)/5 exploding tags within
this technique's range, with X being the number of tags you detonate.
In all other regards, it functions identically to the D-rank Remote
Detonation Technique.<br>

### --( Kekkai Houjin - Barrier Encampment Method )--<br>
One of the most tried-and-true methods of setting traps using
explosives, this puts an array of four explosive tags around the
boundary of an area. If anyone tries to pass through the area the tags
will detonate, spelling misfortune for the target.<br>
<br>
Rumors of this technique &amp;quot;misfiring&amp;quot; and
eradicating deer and bears are largely fabricated. Humans and summon
animals will trigger it, but not ordinary fauna.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Triggered Detonation<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique cannot be used in combat, as it takes a few minutes to
set up appropriately. You place four exploding tags at the corner of a
square or rectangle, facing inwards; they can be hidden if you have the
Tag Concealment ability.<br>
<br>
Each side of the square they form can be up to double the Area of the
tags you're using in length. When someone moves to leave the area
(meaning if they travel in any direction from the center, or get part
way in and then turn around), the tags will detonate 10 IC later.
Anyone who hasn't escaped the area (or otherwise defended themselves)
by then will take the combined damage of three exploding tags,
regardless of their location within the boundary.<br>
<br>
Notably, anyone outside the 'barrier' is unharmed; part of this
technique is that it directs all the explosive force inwards.<br>
<br>
Directional defenses (such as Earth Shore Return) are insufficient to
protect against this, a the explosion originates from multiple
directions.<br>
<br>

### --( Dokugiri - Poison Mist )--<br>
One of the most disproportionately difficult techniques to master, this
technique requires its user to have advanced knowledge of chemistry,
poisons, and medicine. On top of that, it requires exceedingly precise
chakra control.<br>
<br>
The user gathers chakra in their lungs and molds it into a highly toxic
chemical substance, which they then exhale through their mouth, at
which point it forms a large, purplish cloud.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 25 Chakra Control, 25 Medicine, 25
Research, 25 Toxicology<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you create the mist, roll the lower of your Chakra Control,
Medicine, Research, or Toxicology skill rolls (all of those factor into
creating the poison properly, and a deficiency in any of them will
weaken it). This is the TN to avoid being poisoned while in the cloud.<br>
<br>
Anyone inside the mist when it's created, or who passes through it,
must make a Resistance roll against that number, and another one every
10 IC that they spend inside the cloud, as well as one any time they
make a Stamina roll inside it.<br>
<br>
The cloud is a poison with the following effects:<br>
Poison: (Toxicology)/5<br>
Paralysis: (Medicine)/6<br>
Suffocation: (Research)/10, applied every 10 IC<br>
<br>
Additionally, the cloud itself has a (Chakra Control)/5 visibility
penalty throughout its entire area.<br>
<br>
The duration of this poison (how long it will last once somebody's
exited the cloud) is the sum of your ranks in all those skills. The
cloud itself will last twice that long, after which point it will
harmlessly dissipate.<br>
<br>
You are not immune to your own poison mist.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Hari Jizou - Needle Jizo )--<br>
By directing chakra into their hair, the shinobi causes it to grow
rapidly. This results in their hair not only getting longer, but also
growing in volume and hardening into what amounts to a forest of sharp,
needle-thin and iron-hard spikes. Even the best-groomed hair becomes
wild and spiky under the effects of this technique! This can be used
for a number of derivative techniques, and on its own provides a
surprisingly strong defense, as the hair will wrap around its owner to
protect them from attacks.<br>
<br>
When this technique ends, the user's hair returns to its normal length.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20+3*X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: X<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
X has a maximum of 10. Your hair's length increases by X feet! However,
now you have a lot of bulky, chakra-strengthened hair, that gets in the
way when you're trying to do super-fast ninja battles. When dodging, or
moving as part of an attack, you suffer an X/2 immobilization penalty
(rounded up); in the case of moving while attacking, this applies to
the distance you can move, the Accuracy of the attack itself, and
anything else you may need to do until the next IC.<br>
<br>
You gain a Damage Reduction of (Ninjutsu damage bonus)*(X)/2, which is
doubled while blocking. Additionally, the damage you take is considered
(2.5)*(X)% lower for the purposes of determining wounds. Anyone
attacking you from a distance of (X/3) yards or less will take (your
ninjutsu damage bonus)*(speed of their attack) damage; this does not
apply if X is 2 or lower. So long as X is 3 or higher, this applies to
all melee attacks.<br>
<br>
As a Speed 10, Chakra 5+5*Y action, you may increase X's value by Y, up
to the maximum of 10.<br>
<br>
Whenever you suffer an Ignite effect, X is reduced by half the Ignite's
severity; whenever your suffer a Slashing wound, X is reduced by 1 per
level of the wound's severity (1 for a Minor, 2 for a Major, and so on).<br>
<br>
If X is reduced to 0, this technique ends.<br>
<br>
\page<br>

<br>
### --( Hari Jigoku - Needle Hell )--<br>
While Needle Jizo is active, the shinobi focuses more chakra into their
hair. There is a telltale bristling and very obvious 'aiming' of their
hair, before they fire of hundreds of sharpened hair-needles at nearby
enemies. While these are very tiny, there are enough of them, moving
fast enough, to pose a credible threat to all but the hardiest of
shinobi.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 10d4*X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15, Delay 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: Line X yards wide, to a range of X*5 yards<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Needle Jizo active<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
X is a value up to Needle Jizo's current Upkeep; after using Needle
Hell, Needle Jizo's Upkeep (and other, related effects) are reduced by
X. When performing Needle Hell, you multiply your ninjutsu damage bonus
by the lower of (X*2) or the technique's Speed; thus, if you did not
lower its Speed with AP, and set X = 4, you would roll damage as
10d4*4+(ninjutsu damage bonus)*8.<br>
<br>
When this technique's Delay ends, anyone in the area will be
automatically struck by the flying needles; raising ninjutsu-based
defenses ahead of time (such as Earth Shore Return or Water Encampment
Wall) is explicitly allowed and automatically successful, but no
defensive interrupts (such as dodging) function against this technique.
In addition, any Damage Reduction a victim has is doubled against
Needle Hell's damage.<br>

### --( Ranjishigami no Jutsu - Art of the Raging Lion's Mane )--<br>
Using their empowered hair, the Shinobi extends and manipulates it to
grapple with and usually heavily damage their target. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: X*10 yards<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Needle Jizo active<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique uses the current upkeep of Needle Jizo as X. <br>
<br>
When using this technique, make an Accuracy roll which ignores
immobilization penalties. If it hits, your hair grapples the target;
you may then immediately use an Grapple technique of B-rank or lower
that you know, with no Stamina or Chakra cost, at only half its normal
Speed. So long as your hair maintains this grapple, you may continue to
use it to perform grapple techniques; your hair has up to X 'limbs',
for the purposes of determining which locks and holds you can maintain.
All Grapple techniques after the first use their normal Speed, and have
a Chakra cost equal to (and replacing) their normal Stamina cost.<br>
<br>
Techniques performed this way use (ninjutsu damage bonus + X) rather
than your physical bonus. You use CHA in place of STR for your damage
dice and grapple checks, and have a +X bonus to your grapple checks
with Art of the Raging Lion's Mane. If an opponent fails an Escape
Grapple attempt by 20 or more, they are unable to break free; Escape
Grapple simply fails, with a Speed of 4 and a Stamina cost of (4 + the
amount they fail by, as normal).<br>
<br>
You do not suffer any of the normal downsides from being involved in a
grapple, and your opponent cannot perform grapple techniques against
you. They may not shift the grapple, only break free. If you and your
victim move more than this technique's range from one another, they
break free automatically. Once they do break free, your Needle Jizo
ends (its X being set to 0). If you end Art of the Raging Lion's Mane
yourself, however, Needle Jizo is not ended prematurely.<br>
<br>
While using Art of the Raging Lion's Mane you do not receive any of
Needle Jizo's normal benefits, but do suffer its normal penalties.<br>
<br>
______________________&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Toumegane no Jutsu - Telescope Technique )-- <br>
A very advanced, and in the right hands powerful, technique this jutsu
can only be performed by the most skilled of Shinobi. Utilizing an
expensive crystal ball and intense concentration, the user can view
locations from extremely long distances. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 500 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: (Chakra Control / 10) Miles<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Chakra Control 50, Crystal Ball (see
below)<br>
<br>
Effects: <br>
As a Speed 10 action you may focus the Crystal Ball's view to any
location within range and view the area through the ball. This cannot
penetrate chakra shields, nor can it move its view around quickly. A
speed 10 action is required to change the crystal's viewpoint even
slightly.<br>
<br>
There is another feature, which requires the user to know a person's
chakra signature intimately. This means spending time studying them
while training with ninjutsu in a calm setting for at least 5 minutes.
Once a person's chakra signature is known, this technique can be
performed to focus in upon that person, following them around near
flawlessly at up to double the normal range. Note, this still cannot be
used to locate someone hidden behind a chakra barrier of any sort. <br>
<br>
The crystal balls used in this technique are expensive, costing 2000
Ryo. They're also rare and typically need to be custom made; they can
only be purchased with Savings, not Requisition.<br>
\page<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Meisaigakure no Jutsu - Hiding With Camouflage Technique )--<br>
An advanced technique where a ninja distorts how light is reflected
around their body with chakra inflections, which makes them almost
invisible to most normal senses.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique may be used when already in Stealth; it raises you to
level 3 Stealth. If you end this technique's Upkeep, you are lowered to
level 2 Stealth. If you break your Stealth for some other reason (such
as moving, or attacking), then Meisaigakure also ends.<br>
<br>
Once hidden by Meisaigakure, you are effectively invisible so long as
you maintain its Upkeep. You could use this in the middle of a room and
then go unnoticed when a group of people entered and had a
conversation--though it does not make you intangible.<br>
<br>
If an enemy has a heightened sense of smell (such as an Inuzuka's
ninken) or a doujutsu capable of viewing chakra, then your Stealth TN
is considered 10 points lower (as if you were only in level 2 Stealth)
for the purposes of hiding from them.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Bunshin Daibakuha - Clone Great Explosion )--<br>
Fundamentally, most clones are little more than dense, mobile bundles
of chakra. This technique takes advantage of that by essentially
converting them into bombs, overloading them with the user's chakra and
sending them to converge on a single point before exploding.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16, Delay 6 + Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 24<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
After finishing this technique's handseals, some or all (your choice)
of your clones will charge towards a specific location before
exploding. Clones activated with this technique can no longer take any
other actions, but nor can they be destroyed by other means, and they
no longer provide the normal benefits of clones (that is, the chance
that an opponent will accidentally strike them instead of you). In the
case of clones capable of using jutsu, any Upkeeps they're maintaining
end immediately.<br>
<br>
The &amp;quot;Special&amp;quot; portion of the Delay is however
long it would take the clones to move from your current location to the
center of the explosion (the location you target with this technique).
They move at full speed, though immobilization penalties (such as from
the ground being turned to mud) may still slow them down.<br>
<br>
Anyone hit by the explosion is allowed a Resistance roll against your
Chakra Control (including you, if you're hit). Those who passes their
roll take only half damage, and suffer half the normal status effects
(excepting the visibility penalty from water clone explosions, as it is
based on the location, rather than who it hits).<br>
<br>
Like the explosions from Exploding Tags, it is not possible to dodge
the detonation of this technique. Each type of clone is considered to
be an elemental ninjutsu of its appropriate element (shadow clones
being non-elemental). Mud, Water, and Shadow Clones inflict Blunt
wounds. Rock Clones deal Slashing damage, and Lightning Clones cause
Energy wounds.<br>
<br>
Mud Clones<br>
&nbsp; Chakra: 10, +10/clone<br>
&nbsp; Damage: 20d20*1 per clone<br>
Anyone hit suffers an Immobilization penalty of 2, +2 per clone. This
penalty is halved (round down for the new value) every 10 IC. <br>
<br>
Rock Clones:<br>
&nbsp; Chakra: 15/clone<br>
&nbsp; Damage: 25d20*1 per clone<br>
Anyone hit suffers a Bleed status of 5/clone, and a Stun of 3/clone.<br>
<br>
Lightning Clones:<br>
&nbsp; Chakra: 10, +20/clone<br>
&nbsp; Damage: 3d100.open(60) per clone<br>
Anyone hit suffers a Paralyze 4 if one clone was used, or 8 for two
clones. This penalty is halved (round down for the new value) every 20
IC.<br>
<br>
Water:<br>
&nbsp; Chakra: 12/clone<br>
&nbsp; Damage: 8d20+100, per clone<br>
When the clones explode, they do so with enough concussive force to
daze anyway hit. They inflict a visibility penalty of -4/clone, which
cannot be mitigated by the Blind Fighting ability. The penalty is
halved (round down) every 10 IC. After the clones explode, the water
used to create them (4 gallons per clone) is returned to the
battlefield.<br>
<br>
Shadow:<br>
&nbsp; Damage: 15d20.open(11) per clone<br>
&nbsp; Stun: 15+5/clone<br>
Performing Clone Explosion with Shadow Clones has no Chakra cost.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu - Shuriken Shadow Clone
Technique )--<br>
Based on the same principle as the much-more-advanced Shadow Clone
technique, this creates copies of an object rather than a shinobi:
specifically, as the name suggests, ordinary shuriken.<br>
<br>
What makes this actually useful is the sheer number of shuriken that
can be replicated with minimal exertion from the shinobi using it; for
truly skilled ninja, it can easily reach into the hundreds.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: (Special) + X/10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (Special)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 5 + STR/4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: (Special)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
One shuriken must be thrown each time this jutsu is used. X additional
shuriken are created in mid-flight, and vanish after this technique is
resolved. X has a maximum value of your CHA.<br>
<br>
Two things must be determined: the attack's strength, and its number of
targets.<br>
<br>
You may direct up to (DEX+CHA)/12 shuriken at any single target. Its
Speed and Damage are determined following the normal rules for
multi-throws. Determine what a normal Stamina cost would be for a
multi-throw using that many shuriken; that becomes the
&amp;quot;Special&amp;quot; portion of Shuriken Shadow Clone's
Chakra cost.<br>
<br>
You may attack any number of targets that way, using up to a maximum of
X+1 shuriken. This is selective, meaning you may choose to hit or
ignore people as you wish within the targeted area. Area-of-Effect
dodge penalties do apply normally, however.<br>
<br>
This is treated as a ranged taijutsu multi-throw using shuriken, and
does receive the normal +2 Accuracy from shuriken. No matter how many
people are targeted, this is treated as a single attack, with one
Accuracy and one damage roll.<br>
<br>
Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique cannot be used with poisoned weapons.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Nunoshibari no Jutsu - Cloth Binding Technique )--<br>
The shinobi uses a giant roll of cloth to wrap their target and, of
course, infuses it with chakra. Not only does this make it
significantly stronger (as one would hope, seeing as cloth is not
generally known for its ability to restrain superhuman ninjas), but it
also lays a foundation upon which various sealing jutsu can be applied,
should the shinobi performing this technique, or one of their allies,
know any.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20, Delay 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 50 yards of cloth<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Using this against a target without a -4 or greater Immobilization
penalty causes its Accuracy penalty to be doubled (to -16), and
explicitly prevents that penalty from being removed (such as by
performing this as a Sneak Attack) or reduced. While the cloth is
thrown from a distance (and guided by chakra), it's relatively
slow-moving and very obvious.<br>
<br>
If this hits, the target is immediately placed at a -10 immobilization
penalty, which cannot be reduced or negated without breaking free of
this technique. The person trapped inside is unable to take any
non-Interrupt action other than struggling to escape. Additionally,
they cannot use equipment or perform any task which would require the
use of their hands or arms. This is a Speed 0 action, in which the
defender rolls 1d20+STR/10 against 1d20+CHA/10 from the shinobi who
used this technique. If it fails, it applies a Stun 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
Once someone is trapped, seals can be applied to the Cloth Bind, with
varying effects. Any Accuracy penalties normally associated with these
techniques do not apply; instead, they receive a +6 Accuracy bonus.
Note that these seals are applied to the cloth bind itself, not the
individual (and as such, escaping would end all the effects)--indeed,
it is impossible to apply seals to someone trapped inside Cloth
Binding, as the cloth disrupts the delicate chakra frameworks needed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Five Elements Seal: The victim cannot spend Chakra
in any way, and all Upkeeps they have (including Upkeep 0) end
immediately and cannot be reestablished.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sacred Silence Seal: The target becomes unable to
produce noise; any sounds they would make are muted (even without their
mouth being covered). Additionally, their chakra, and that of the cloth
bind, cannot be seen or sensed (by doujutsu, chakra sensors, or natural
chakra). If they have any of those senses, they are similarly disabled.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Influence Seal: It is impossible for the victim to
perform any sort of taijutsu.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Evil Sealing Method: If the Upkeep used to pay for
the technique is ended, the person who originally paid it has 20 IC to
resume the Upkeep (a Speed 10 action) before the Cloth Bind's effects
ends; if they do so, the cloth bind remains intact and functioning
normally.<br>
<br>
<br>
If all four of those seals are applied, the cloth bind no longer has an
upkeep and becomes effectively permanent. At this point it is also
possible for someone who knows Nemurihane (the B-rank Genjutsu) to
apply a Rune-Inscribing Technique to the Cloth Bind. This will allow
the victim to be placed in, and woken from, a state of suspended
animation at will.<br>
<br>
A total of 100 or more damage will destroy the cloth bind, freeing the
trapped individual; the cloth takes damage from anything targeting them
before they do. It is also impossible to target the victim with medical
ninjutsu or genjutsu while they are still trapped inside the cloth.<br>
<br>
The victim can be freed by anyone able to remain in melee, as a Speed
20 Delay 20 action. After the cloth bind has been escaped (by any
means), all seals on it dissipate and the cloth itself becomes useless,
<br>

# Doton Ninjutsu<br>
## E-rank<br>
### --( Ganseki Tsuppari - Rock Thrust )--<br>
Often stomping beforehand, you then motion forward and either shoot a
narrow column or spike at your opponent, or a rock of decent size.
Whichever way, this is the weakest of any Doton.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 6<br>

______________________<br>

<br>
### --( Mimizu no Jutsu - Earthworm Technique )--<br>
Sending a tiny rumble through the earth ahead of you, you cause the
area around your opponents to explosively sprout spikes from the ground
into their ankles and shins! It's rather painful and good for catching
a small group of opponents.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Radius: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Dodging this technique allows people to avoid its initial damage, but
they are still inside the field of rock spikes.<br>
<br>
Anyone inside the affected area has their movement speed halved. People
crossing the area may choose to move at full speed, but take 1d4+(your
ninjutsu damage bonus) every IC spent moving. In the case of using
Shunshin in this area, it's treated as a single Speed 2 movement.<br>
<br>
This technique cannot inflict wounds.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Monosugai no Jutsu - Earth Shaping Technique )--<br>
You inject your own chakra through your hands into a natural surface to
allow it's texture to become more like mud or clay as your fingers sink
into it. This can be used to all sorts of ends. Making a statue,
digging a hole, climbing a wall, whatever you want! ...As long as it
has to do with rocks and stuff.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can shape the surface of a rock, or mold it in your hands like
clay. If you use this before climbing an earthen surface (be it a cliff
face or a castle wall) you gain a +5 bonus to Athletics checks
associated with climbing it, by making hand- and footholds (for
yourself only). This doesn't work if you're, saying, climbing up the
side of a cliff face using a rope. I really shouldn't have needed to
say that, but, yanno.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
### --( Yurokensei - Tremorsense )--<br>
Often placing a hand to the ground after the seals to feel the
vibrations, this technique helps you find nearby creatures and enemies.
Most importantly, enemies! Their steps, no matter how quiet, can be
sensed by you from a great distance!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10 + Chakra Control skill ranks and
bonuses<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can perform an Awareness check against anyone touching the ground
or any rock surface (include worked stone, such as brick walls), using
your Chakra Control skill rank in place of your Awareness skill rank.
Anyone not hiding is located automatically; if you find someone you
know exactly where they are the moment you use this (if they're close
enough to be in battle, this will typically break their stealth), but
do not retain 'sight' of them.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Doton: Shindou - Earth Release: Tremor )--<br>
Extra earth-elemental chakra is infused another Doton technique. When
the technique hits the ground, or somebody touching the ground, it
causes the earth itself to shake violently in that exact spot. The
property damage potential's pretty impressive, but nothing compared to
serious offensive jutsu.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: +5, +1 per rank above E<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: +3<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique is used in combination with a damage-dealing Doton
jutsu, increasing its Seal Speed and Chakra cost accordingly. The
technique has a radius of 3 yards, +3 yards per rank above E. Notably,
anyone who is actually airborne (&amp;quot;jumping as they
dodge&amp;quot; doesn't count) is unaffected.<br>
<br>
Within this area, the shaking ground imposes a Stun 3, +1 per rank the
jutsu Shindou was used with is above E; if the technique Shindou was
used with already inflicts a Stun, that Stun is increased by the
jutsu's rank (instead of Shindou's normal effect). Anyone not targeted
by the original attack must dodge Shindou, in which case the original
technique's Accuracy bonuses or penalties are ignored.<br>
<br>
This can be used on its own as Chakra 8, Speed 6, and Seal Speed 6. In
this case it's Radius 10, Stun 5, centered on (but not affecting)
yourself. It does also require a strike roll in this case.<br>

## D-rank<br>
### --( Doki Kantsuu no Jutsu - Earthen Skewer Technique )--<br>
Rock Thrust, except actually meant to do serious harm to people outside
of training matches. You summon a spike of earth actually capable of
skewering an enemy! This can also be more of a solid hit, not as
pointy, as to whatever degree they want, and can even look like a fist
or some similar, stylized attack, but it's still just big rocks coming
at you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 12d10*1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Earthen Skewer inflicts Piercing wounds, and has its damage increased
by 10% when checking to see if it caused a wound.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Tama no Nendo - Clay Bullet )--<br>
Pushing your chakra into the ground beneath you, you pull up a ball of
earth and mud, globby and chakra filled that you then launch or
literally throw sometimes at the opponent. Once on them, the mud is
held semi-cohesive by the chakra lacing it, which can restrict the
victim's movement.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If the victim fails a status roll, this inflicts a -5 Immobilization
penalty that fades by 1 every 10 initiative counts.<br>
<br>
Someone affected by this mud may make a 1d20+STR/5 (theirs) vs.
1d20+CHA/5 (yours) check to break free. This is a Speed 5 action; for
every point they succeed by, the penalty is reduced by 1. For every 5
points they succeed by, the action's Speed is reduced by 5 (potentially
all the way down to 0).<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Iwa Funsai Buin - Rock-Smashing Staff )--<br>
You hold out your hands or similarly grab some nearby rock and create a
large, blunt object from it! This is often a hammer or staff, but also
could be stylized however you see fit. As we all know, getting hit with
rocks hurts, so this is rather painful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You create a bo staff or naginata out of rocks or dense,
chakra-congealed earth. When using it, you add half your ninjutsu
damage bonus to your physical damage bonus, and add a Stun 4 (or
increase its existing Stun by 3) effect ot it. This weapon persists
until you let go of it.<br>
<br>

### --( Shinjuu Zanshu no Jutsu - Double Suicide Decapitation Technique
)--<br>
After thoroughly concealing yourself, this technique allows you to move
through the ground for a short amount of time, long enough though to
position yourself under the enemy and pull them down under the ground. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If used above ground, this jutsu causes you to submerge beneath the
ground and immediately enter Stealth 2, with a +5 bonus. Your awareness
of the outside world is limited to knowing whether or not somebody's in
range of this technique. Submerging has the listed chakra cost, speed,
and seal speed.<br>
<br>
You may burst out and attack someone in range (making this a surprise
attack, but not a sneak attack unless you had the full time to prepare
with them in range), grabbing them and pulling them underground as you
escape. This is Speed 10, with no chakra cost or seal speed. This
applies a -8 immobilization penalty, and completely prevents the victim
from moving, until they take a Speed 8 action to free themselves.<br>
<br>
It can also be used while underground, in which case the Chakra cost is
paid at the time of use, but there is no Seal Speed. In this case, it
could be (potentially) used as a sneak attack.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
### --( Doro Bunshin no Jutsu - Mud Clone Technique )--<br>
An advanced variation of Bunshin no Jutsu, this jutsu creates solid
clones made from the earth beneath a shinobi's feet, which change their
appearance to look like the user. They have many advantages over normal
clones, but are significantly more difficult to create.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12, +4 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6, +1 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4, +2 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
These follow all the rules for regular bunshin, with the following
exceptions.<br>
<br>
If someone strikes a mud clone with an unarmed attack, they suffer a -4
immobilization penalty, reduced by 1 every 10 IC. If they attack with a
melee weapon, they roll 1d20+STR/10 against your 1d20+CHA/8; if they
fail, the weapon is stuck in the clone (which is exposed as a clone),
and retrieving it requires a strike roll and another strength check.<br>
<br>
Against ranged attacks, mud clones can take 50 points of damage before
being destroyed (and revealed as clones).<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Jishin Shushou - Earth Shaking Palm )--<br>
Harnessing a large amount of chakra into the palm of your hand, you
then slam it down into the ground in front of you to blast rocks and
debris up to distract your opponents, allowing you to quickly escape
their field of view or capitalize on the momentary distraction.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 13<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Radius: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts a Stun 5 against everyone in the area if they fail to
dodge it. You may immediately Hide as part of this technique.<br>
<br>
______________________&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Retsudotensho - Split Earth Turn Around Palm )--<br>
This technique causes the ground surrounding the enemy to spiral
inwards on itself, burying them alive or crushing them. This technique
is capable of causing quite a bit of damage to the area. This technique
is much more damaging if used in rocky mountainous areas, or inside a
cave. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 26<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 28d12*1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If this hits and does not have its effects reduced by partial defense,
it also inflicts a -8 immobilization penalty until the victim leaves
the entire affected area, as they fall into the destroyed section of
ground. This occurs automatically if it's used underground, such as in
a cave.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Doryuu Taiga - Earth Flow River )--<br>
You cause a long stretch of nearby ground to become mud and slide your
opponents down a torrenting river of rocks and dirt, spewing them out
at the end. This often leaves people hurt, and disoriented!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 12d4*1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20, 10 Line<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This moves anyone hit by it CHA/8+5 Yards all in the direction the
river 'flows' (chosen by the line). Everyone receives a Stun equal to
how far they move -5; the stun is divided by 3 if they block.<br>
<br>
If this is blocked by an effect which halts its progress (such as Earth
Shore Return), nobody behind that effect is affected.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Doroku Gaeshi - Earth Shore Return )--<br>
Slamming both hands into the ground, the user can cause a large
rectangle wall of earth to pop up in front up them, covering whatever
attack someone may be directing at them. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This creates a wall 4 yards wide and 3 yards high that takes the hit
from an attack. This wall absorbs 200 + 10*(Ninjutsu damage bonus)
damage. If destroyed, any remaining damage carries on to you (in which
case you cannot defend against it further) or whoever else you used
this to protect (in which case, they can).<br>
<br>
As implied up there, this can be used to protect anyone in range.
However, Earth Shore Return can't be used against melee attacks, or
ranged attacks originating 5 yards or less away from you. After having
all its HP depleted, or at the end of the IC it was used on, the wall
crumbles into dirt and gravel.<br>
<br>
This wall takes double damage from Raiton, and half damage from Suiton.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Kaigeki Chite - Crushing Earth Hand )--<br>
You create a huge hand of rock that you can manipulate and wield, in
place of your actual hand. Though you have no physical connection to
the large hand, your chakra flowing through it is controlled by an
intense focus on your right hand. Or left hand, if that's your main.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10 +CHA/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can use the giant rock hand to use any non-grapple E or D rank
Taijutsu technique, or simply a basic attack, as long as the ability is
one that would utilize your hands. No kicks or clan jutsu allowed! It
may use C rank techniques, but doing so counts as 2 uses. The rock hand
is good for only 2 uses, at which point it breaks apart into ordinary
rocks unless you pay its Chakra cost again; doing so has no speed or
seal speed, but still has its Chakra cost and preserves it for 3 more
uses. The hand uses your CHA +50 as its STR, for the purpose of
determining its damage bonus.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Doro Nami no Jutsu - Mud Wave Technique )--<br>
Your chakra being applied to your legs, you turn the ground below your
feet into mud which you then stand upon, riding the wave at increased
speeds as you flow across the battlefield. This is a good mode of
transportation, and a good way to enhance an earth attack!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You increase your AGI stat for the purposes of movement by CHA/2. You
may choose to end this technique at any time, or as part of another
Doton jutsu. If you end it as part of a jutsu, that technique gains a
Stun equal to 2+(your ninjutsu damage bonus)/3, or increases its
existing Stun by that much, from absorbing the mud used in this
technique.<br>
<br>
This is incompatible with effects which increase your normal movement
speed--such as the Runner ability, and Racing Thunder Technique. While
Mud Wave is active, you do not receive their benefits.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Moguragakure no Jutsu - Hiding Like a Mole Technique )--<br>
Channeling your chakra into the ground below you, you turn the dirt or
earth or rock into fine sand. It effects your entire body so you simply
slide down quickly, but only making a tunnel big enough for one person.
After digging your way down, you can sense everything going on above
still, and can even cover the hole to make it seem like you never even
burrowed away.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You dive down CHA/10 yards underground and are now Stealth level 2, and
are inflicted with Stun 20. If used as an Interrupt, this requires a
dodge roll with a +6 bonus; success, even partial, will allow you to
trigger the second half of this jutsu.<br>
<br>
Next, roll Espionage +5 vs. Awareness. If you are successful, the
opponents can't tell how you left, or that there's a hole in the
ground. They think you simply vanished, or died (if used as an
interrupt against a sufficiently impressive attack). You are hidden at
Stealth 2 at this point, but cannot move, aside from resurfacing (a
simple, Speed 0 action once you can move again).<br>
<br>
This can only be used when standing on earth or unworked stone. A dirt
road would be fine, as would a clay road, but you couldn't use it on a
wooden or brick surface.<br>
<br>
While underground, you have an additional +5 Stealth.<br>
<br>

### --( Dochuu Eigyo no Jutsu - Moving Underground as if Swimming
Technique )--<br>
This technique reduces the consistency of earth into less than that of
fine sand by channelling chakra into it, allowing the user to dig
through it with ease. This affects the entire body, and the earth
returns to its normal consistency after they've passed.<br>
<br>
If the user knows Yurokensei they may activate it alongside this jutsu,
allowing them to find people on the surface as easily as if they were
above ground watching them, but increasing the Upkeep by 5.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may only be used while underground, such as from the effects of
Moguragakure no Jutsu, or to burrow through solid rock. It works only
on unworked stone (you could burst out from under stone tiles, but not
tunnel through a wall).<br>
<br>
You can move underground using CHA/2 in place of AGI for determining
your movement speed. In combat, this requires you to stay close enough
to the surface (to draw breathable air in) that you can be found,
should somebody overcome your hiding. An attack dealing at least 100
damage will break through the surface of the earth above you, ending
this jutsu and penalizing any defense you take by 6, but reducing the
actual damage dealt to you by half.<br>
<br>

## B-rank<br>
### --( Doton: Doryou Dango - Earth Release: Earth Mausoleum Dumpling
)--<br>
Channelling chakra into your arms and the ground below you, you place
your hands on the earth and lift up an incredibly large (no, really,
just look at the Area on this thing!) ball of earth and rock, which is
then thrown at your enemies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 44<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 44d20*1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 12<br>

### --( Doryuukatsu - Earth Flow Divide )--<br>
Flowing your energy into special underground 'Dragon Veins' (that means
chakra leylines, not a literal dragon's body--I'm talking to you,
Takuto) you can literally make a tear in the earth, and create a large
chasms. This is most often used as a way of breaking through a large
wall, destroying an enemy camp or other barricades and such. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 25d20*1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 18<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Any damage from this technique is tripled against an inanimate,
stationary object. Don't even ask if this tripling can be done against
a player or NPC.<br>
<br>
This can selectively target anything on a line with a length of your
Chakra Control skill ranks in yards, and a width of 5 yards.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Doton: Dorou Domu Kekkai - Earth Release: Earth Prison Dome of
Magnificient Nothingness )--<br>
This creates a dome chamber around a small group of enemies, which you
enlace in your own chakra to make it extra hard to escape.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 32<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This creates a dome of earth directly in front of you, with you at the
edge of its radius. Anyone who cannot dodge is trapped inside the dome.
The dome has 400 + (damage bonus)*10 HP.<br>
<br>
Every 5 IC which pass, the following effects occur:<br>
* Everyone inside the dome has their Chakra penalty increased by 1.<br>
* You have your Chakra penalty reduced by 1 per person inside the dome.<br>
* The dome regains (damage bonus)*5 HP, up to its maximum.<br>
<br>
You must keep one hand on the dome at all times; if you break contact
the above effects ends (and cannot be reestablished), but the dome
retains any HP it had at that point.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Doryuu Jouheki - Earth Flow Rampart )--<br>
Feeding your chakra into the ground you cause the earth to rise under
your feet into a large rampart. The shape of the rampart can be
anything from level ground to a steep, needle-like mountain, and it is
mostly used for walling something off, slowing down pursuers, or
reaching that jar off the top shelf that is always so hard to reach.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Create what is basically a huge wall! It can be up to the following
dimensions: Length = X, Width = X/4, Height = X/2. If you use this and
X is 30 or more, the area you are in counts as rocky terrain for the
purposes of jutsu requirements.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Doton: Iwagakure no Jutsu - Earth Release: Hidden Among Rocks
Technique )--<br>
This technique allows you to blend into rocks and remain hidden. Even
the texture of your body takes on that of the stones, and it's quite
possible (indeed, more than a few experienced jounin have embarrassing
sories about it) to have an enemy physically sit on you without
realizing you're there.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 32<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 28<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This allows you to enter level 3 Stealth, and gives a +10 bonus to your
stealth checks while it's maintained. However, it requires rocky
terrain (such as the inside of a cave, a mountain path, the debris from
a destroyed wall, or a large boulder), and you cannot move more
(blinking and breathing are okay) while it's maintained.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Doton: Domu - Earth Release: Earth Spear )--<br>
You direct chakra to flow through the skin over all portions of your
body, increasing your body's defensive power to its utmost limit. This
causes your skin to darken in response to the earth-elemented chakra,
taking on a dull gray-brown, almost black color. This hardening also
empowers your physical attacks, making this a useful, if draining,
all-purpose technique.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 27<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 17<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You reduce all damage you take by your CHA, and increase your physical
damage bonus by half your ninjutsu damage bonus. The severity of all
Wounds you suffer is reduced one category. Raiton bypasses all this
technique's effects, and Suiton has its damage lowered by twice as much
(a DR of CHA*2, rather than just CHA).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Doryuuheki - Earth Style Wall )--<br>
The most powerful direct Doton-based defense, the user either
manipulates the surrounding terrain or generates (using chakra!) and
spits out an prodigious amount of flowing earth which forms a wall and
solidifies. Either way, this creates a barrier coated with chakra that
will stop most attacks totally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 34<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 24<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You create a wall of earth that blocks up to (50 + (ninjutsu damage
bonus)*2 )*(Speed) damage. It takes 50% extra damage from Raiton, but
only half damage from Suiton and Katon.<br>
<br>
You may use Action Points to reduce Doryuuheki's (base) Seal Speed, on
a 1:1 basis, to as low as 12. Note that if you are able to use
Doryuuheki as an interrupt, you may do so without the need for a roll.
Earth Style Wall can only be used against attacks which originated more
than 5 yards away from you.<br>
<br>
Used against area-of-effect attacks, this may protect multiple people,
as long as they can all be placed behind the same 15 yard long line.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Iwa Bunshin - Rock Clone )--<br>
You either gather animate rocks from you, or actually generate them
with chakra and regurgitate a stream of stones (somehow, you're
protected from a cut esophagus or chipped teeth during this process).
Either way, the rocks then take on a human shape and appearance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10, +6 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10, +2 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10, +3 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may create up to 3 clones that can look like yourself or anyone
else present. If they look like someone else, that person may then hide
amongst your clones to receive the normal benefits of having clones;
these can even be added to their own clones.<br>
<br>
Rock clones can take 100+(your ninjutsu damage bonus)*5 points of
damage before being destroyed, or exposed as clones, and take only half
damage from AoE attacks.<br>
<br>
Rock clones use your attributes, even if they're imitating someone
else. They may take the following actions:<br>
<br>
[1 AP] Dodge: Usable if the clone needs to defend itself.<br>
<br>
[4 AP] Attack: The clone may perform a basic unarmed attack. This does
benefit from Power Attack or Unarmed Focus, if you have those
abilities, but the cloen does not need to make a Stamina roll.<br>
<br>
[X AP] Move: Every 3 Speed of the Move action costs 1 AP.<br>
<br>
When Rock Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be Held
Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold
Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for
dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by
one category.<br>
<br>

### --( Doryu Ken - Earth Style Fist )--<br>
By surrounding your arm or leg in a coat of solidified earth, you can
attack an opponent while being protected from direct contact with them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 17<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
So long as this technique is maintained, your taijutsu attacks are
enhanced. You suffer no 'on-contact' effects (such as damage from
punching a foe covered in spikes) from performing unarmed attacks.
Additionally, unarmed parries cannot be used against your attacks.<br>

A dragon-like head of rock, mud, and dirt rises up from the gound, its

impressive as some techniques, Doryuudan is incredibly demanding upon
its user--and incredibly devastating to its victims.<br>

### --( Iwa Renda no Jutsu - Rock Barrage Technique )--<br>
After performing the necessary seals, the user channels chakra into the
rocks and stone around them. Their chakra causes large rocks to shatter
into smaller ones, which are then launched as high-velocity projectiles
towards potentially dozens of targets.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 48<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 20d20*1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 7 * (ninjutsu damage bonus)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 26<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique may only be used in rocky terrain. You may hit up to
(ninjutsu damage bonus) targets.<br>
<br>
You may target the same person multiple times, up to one quarter of
your maximum. Every additional 'target' spent on them gives a +1 bonus
to Accuracy (against that target only) and increases the damage by 5d20.<br>

### --( Doton: Yomi Numa - Earth Release: Swamp of the Underworld )--<br>
This changes the surface of the ground across a broad area into a
viscous, muddy morass. While the amount of chakra required to perform
this technique can be prohibitive in most combat situations, this
technique, when properly used, can give incredible tactical control
over an area.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 150<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The swamp imposes a -12 immobilization penalty on anyone caught in it,
which, after all reductions and modifications, may not exceed -9.<br>
<br>
You may adjust the affected area within the limits of this jutsu's
dimensions. For example, you could leave an island of normal ground at
the center for yourself, or a narrow path for you and your allies to
run through, forming a chokepoint. This does allow you to shrink the
total affected area, if you wish.<br>
<br>
Alternately, you may use form the 'swamp' in the form of a line up to
200 yards long and 100 yards across, oriented in any fashion.<br>

### --( Doton: Sando no Jutsu - Earth Release: Mountain Earth Technique
)--<br>
The user creates two monolithic walls up from the ground, destroying
the environment for several hundred yards in either direction, and
sends them at one another.&nbsp; As they approach each other, their
momentum builds, starting off slow and ending with a collision that
removes the third dimension from anything unlucky enough to be caught
between them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 50d20*1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 80<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30, Delay 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 26<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique's damage is doubled for determining if it inflicts
wounds. If it does cause a wound, it also causes two wounds of the next
lower severity, three of the severity below that, and so forth.<br>
<br>
Thus, if it inflicted a Critical Wound, it would also inflict two
Severes, three Majors, and four Minors.<br>
<br>
You may reduce Sando's speed below its Delay.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Doton: Chidoukaku - Earth Release: Moving Earth Core )--<br>
The user lowers or raises the ground in the surrounding area at high
speed, creating giant depressions or spires. Despite how this might
seem, it's fairly harmless to the surrounding area. People, plants, and
buildings on the affected area will be largely undisturbed. The sides
of the hole or spire are quite sturdy, and it's not in danger of
collapsing on its own.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30+X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt (uh, yeah, good luck with
that)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 28<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This affects everything in a square of up to 50 yards on a side,
centered on its user. It moves the ground in that area X*(damage bonus)
yards straight up, or straight down.<br>
<br>
If you manage to use this as an interrupt, this will allow you to avoid
a technique if you move yourself out of its range.<br>

## Fuuton Ninjutsu<br>
### E-rank<br>
### --( Fuusajin no Jutsu - Dust Wind Technique )--<br>
You use a burst of wind to blow dust, dirt, or other loose particles up
into the air, producing an irritating cloud that briefly obscures the
visions of people caught inside of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 4 wide, 10 long, directly in front of you<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Anyone hit suffers -4 visibility for the next 10 IC.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Soujikaze no Jutsu - Cleansing Wind Technique )--<br>
The basic &amp;quot;manipulate the surrounding air to do what you
want&amp;quot; technique, leading into many more powerful
jutsu&nbsp; that operate on the same premise. It's still useful,
for a sufficiently resourceful ninja.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 7<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Radius: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 7<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This reduces any existing visibility penalties resulting from smoke,
mist, clouds of dust, or the like, by 4. Repeated use of this jutsu
will reduce them further, potentially eliminating them
entirely.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Fuuton: Kazekiri - Wind Release: Wind Cutter )--<br>
The user generates a narrow arc of wind and chakra, which is sent out
to cut things like ropes, lines, and people.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 11<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d4*5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique's damage is considered 50% higher for determining
whether or not it inflicts wounds.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Hineri Dangan - Wind Release: Twister Shot )--<br>
Holding their hand half-grasped, the user blows a constant stream of
wind into their hand which begins to spiral around in a ball or small
tornado shape. The tornado is then sent out toward the target as the
hand is opened. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d4*5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 11<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Shikisetsufuu Shou - Wind Release: Four Seasonal Winds
Palm )--<br>
In a fashion similar to how ninja knead chakra into their palms and
feet to stick to walls and ceilings, you gather wind-elemental chakra,
but project and hold it just beyond your body to supplement your
unarmed strikes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: This technique may not have its seal
speed removed with a fan<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Chakra Control 7<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
While this technique's upkeep is maintained, all your unarmed taijutsu
techniques are blocked as if they were fuuton jutsu (meaning, in most
cases, that blocking reduces the damage by only 25%, instead of 50%).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Hagitoru Aori no Jutsu - Tearing Gust Technique )--<br>
Generally performed with a fan as a matter of practicality, this
technique unleashes a burst of wind that will not only deflect
projectiles, but also strip them of any chakra they may be infused with.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 11<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is usable as an interrupt against any thrown weapon attack. Make
an Accuracy roll against your attacker's; success means you deflect
their attack harmlessly.<br>
<br>
However, even if you fail their attack has its damage reduced by 25%,
and any ninjutsu effects on it (such as Housenka) are removed.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Rakuyou Buyou - Falling Leaves Dance )--<br>
Using the wind, you kick up any light debris in the area (leaves in a
forest, sand in a desert, conveniently ubiquitous scraps of paper in a
town) to swirl around you just long enough for you to make a sneaky,
ninja-fast getaway.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You Hide, with a +5 bonus.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton Nagare - Wind Release Stream )--<br>
By blowing air from your mouth, you can change direction in mid-air.
This allows you to control where you land when falling (avoiding the
sharp rocks when you jump off a waterfall, that kind of thing) and may
be useful for avoiding mid-air hazards.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 11<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
As described, you can control your direction in mid-air. This can also
be used when falling from any height, to slow yourself sufficiently to
avoid being harmed by the impact from hitting the ground.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Taikyaku Haretsu - Wind Release: Bursting
Retreat&nbsp; )--<br>
You take in a deep breath, then exhale a mixture of air and chakra with
enough speed and force to augment a backwards leap, allowing you to
hastily escape... well, whatever manner of unpleasantness you felt the
need to get away from.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 8+X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When attempting to dodge an AoE, you normally suffer a penalty to dodge
if you are unable to move fast enough. This technique is used alongside
a Dodge interrupt (increasing its Speed accordingly), and removes X*2
points of the penalty.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Kamaitachi no Jutsu - Sickle Wind Technique )--<br>
This technique allows you to create and manipulate many small air
currents and vacuum pockets in the form of a whirling gale, which is
directed at an opponent before it dissipates. This produces injuries
that resemble what one would expect to see from dozens of blades.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 3d8*5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 18<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique's damage is considered 50% higher for the purpose of
causing wounds.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Shinkuuha - Wind Release: Vacuum Wave )--<br>
The user takes in a deep breath an spins while exhaling, forming
several rotating blades of wind that cover a substantial area around
them, slicing through multiple foes at once while leaving allies
unharmed<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 21<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d6*5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 20 yard radius, centered around the user<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique may differentiate between enemies and allies within its
area of effect. It ignores armor, and its damage is considered 25%
higher for the purpose of causing wounds.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Daitoppa - Wind Release: Great Breakthrough )--<br>
A relatively simple technique which creates a sudden gust of wind. Its
actual force varies wildly based upon the strength of the user. A
superior shinobi will produce alarmingly destructive results, while a
weaker one would be better off finding other methods to attack.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d4*5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 15, +(damage bonus)*2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This uses double the user's normal ninjutsu damage bonus, and inflicts
Blunt wounds. It also knocks the victim back (user's damage bonus)*3
yards.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Reppuushou - Wind Release: Violent Wind Palm )--<br>
After finishing the seals, the user claps their palms together and
compresses the air in front of them, transforming it into a powerful
gale with enough force to knock over a human or redirect projectile
weapons.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This can be used as an attack, as an interrupt, or in combination with
a multi-throw.<br>
<br>
As an attack, it does 2d6*5 damage and, if it hits, knocks an enemy
prone as if they'd been hit by the E-rank Taijutsu Trip, using your
Chakra Control +5 in place of your Athletics.<br>
<br>
As an interrupt, it can be used in response to a thrown weapon attack.
Make an Accuracy roll against the opponent's Accuracy. If you succeed
you redirect their attack at them, using its original accuracy, adding
2d4*5 plus this technique's damage bonus times speed to their attack's
normal damage. Wounds inflicted are based on the thrown attack.<br>
<br>
In combination with a multi-throw, this adds its Speed and modified
Seal Speed to the total Speed (not factored into damage bonus
calculation) of the multi-throw. The attack uses the combined range of
the throw and jutsu to determine its maximum range, and adds 2d6*5,
plus (this technique's Speed)*(ninjutsu damage bonus), to the
multi-throw's damage. Wounds inflicted are based on the thrown attack.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kazekame Kaigara no Jutsu - Wind Turtle's Shell Technique )--<br>
The technique creates a rotating dome of wind around the user,
chakra-infused air moving quickly enough to blur the image of the
person inside, and deflect many incoming attacks. However, the
technique is a far cry from being a true absolute defense.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may be used against ranged offensive ninjutsu which use
projectiles (such as Clay Bullet, but not Earthen Skewer), ranged
taijutsu attacks. or area-of-effect ninjutsu. If used against a
technique of C-rank or below, its Chakra cost is 14. Each rank above C
increases Wind Turtle Shell's Chakra cost by 6.<br>
<br>
Make an Accuracy roll against the attack. If you succeed, the attack is
avoided as if you parried it. Against Raiton and ranged taijutsu
attacks, you receive a bonus to your Accuracy roll equal to your
Ninjutsu Damage Bonus. Against non-Katon 'projectile'-based ninjutsu,
your bonus is instead +4. For Katon and area-of-effect ninjutsu, you
receive no bonus.<br>
<br>
This has improved effectiveness against Raiton and ranged taijutsu:
Even if they hit, the effect of partial defense is doubled (the attack
deals only 10% damage per point it hits by).<br>
<br>
However, it's vulnerable to Katon. If a Katon technique bypasses Wind
Turtle's Shell you receive no benefit from partial defense, and the
technique has its damage (against you) increased by 25%.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Tobu Choyaku no Jutsu - Vaulting Leap Technique )--<br>
After performing the seals for this jutsu you amass chakra in your
feet, then expel it to generate a powerful burst of wind while kicking
off the ground with a power leap. To the inexperienced, the results
look almost like flight.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 0 + 10 * Y<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 14 + X/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: A fan may not replace this technique's
seal speed.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10 + X * 2, Delay X * 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you activate this technique you can jump (STR /10 - Y *
2)*(ninjutsu damage bonus) yards vertically, or half that distance
horizontally.<br>
<br>
Alternately, you may choose to 'charge' your jump, gathering enough
chakra at your feet to launch yourself a prodigious distance. This
changes the distance moved to (X + STR / 10 - Y * 2)*(ninjutsu damage
bonus). If X is 5 or greater, the horizontal leap distance is not
halved. X has a maximum value of 10.<br>
<br>
If you are suffering from an Immobilization penalty, the distance
you're able to travel with Vaulting Leap is reduced by 5% per point of
Immobilization.<br>
<br>
This technique's Y value starts at 0. Every time you use Vaulting Leap,
it's increased by 1. After you go 50 IC without using Vaulting Leap,
it's reset to 0.<br>
&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Daikamaitachi no Jutsu - Great Sickle Wind Technique )--<br>
The user of this technique releases a powerful burst of wind, chakra
concentrating the air into several layered air streams. This creates
pockets of both vacuums and high-speed air which have enough focused
force behind them to cut down trees.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 28<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d8*6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 24<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This can be used as a normal action (as an attack), or an Interrupt (as
a defensive against a ranged taijutsu attack). As an Interrupt, make an
Accuracy roll against your opponent's Accuracy, adding your ninjutsu
damage bonus; if successful, you deflect their projectiles harmlessly.<br>
<br>
As an attack, it knocks its victim back (ninjutsu damage bonus) yards;
the distance knocked back is reduced by partial defense.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shinkuu Enzan - Decapitating Vacuum Disc )--<br>
As devastating as it is impractical, this technique earned its name for
a reason. After forming the many, many handseals involved, you draw a
shuriken (or one of its larger brethren) and use it to center a disc of
wind chakra. When you throw the weapon, its rotation is passed onto the
chakra, forming a several-foot-wide blade rotating at incredible speed.<br>
<br>
Great for spars and parties!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 42<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Weapon's damage, +(ninjutsu damage
bonus) dice<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: As thrown weapon, +(ninjutsu damage
bonus)*2 yards<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16 + (weapon's Speed)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 40<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Choose a type of shuriken to use with this technique; you may not
multi-throw with Shinkuu Enzan. Add this technique's Speed to the
normal Speed of your thrown weapon attack. This is the Speed of Shinkuu
Enzan (both to use it, and for damage calculations). Add your physical
and ninjutsu damage bonuses together; this is your damage bonus for
Shinkuu Enzan. For calculating wounds, consider Shinkuu Enzan's damage
to be 100% higher. Shinkuu Enzan always deals slashing wounds.<br>
<br>
Although this technique uses a thrown weapon as part of it, it is a
Fuuton ninjutsu technique, not a thrown weapon technique; Weapon Focus
and similar benefits (such as a Fuuma Shuriken's increased damage based
on how much it hits by) do not apply to Shinkuu Enzan, nor do defenses
specifically targeting thrown weapons.<br>
<br>
You may not use a fan to replace Shinkuu Enzan's Seal Speed.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Shinkuugyoku - Wind Release: Vacuum Sphere )--<br>
The user exhales their breath as several small blasts of wind chakra,
each not much larger than a marble but traveling at extreme speeds and
possessing incredible penetrating power. Their small size can make them
difficult to land a strong blow with, which is compensated for by
dispersing them over a significant range.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 38<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 6d8*8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: A fan may not be used to remove this
technique's Seal Speed.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 18<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Shinkuugyoku targets everything in a line 10 yards wide, between you
and its maximum range. You may divide the width by any whole number
between 1 and 5 to multiply the length by half that much. (For example,
you could reduce it to 10/5 = 2 yards wide, and increase its range to
30*2.5 = 75). The Improved Area ability provides only half its normal
benefit to Shinkuugyoku.<br>
<br>
The effects of partial defense a doubled against this technique: for
every point it hits by, it deals only 10% of its full damage. However,
to determine wounds inflicted Shinkuugyoku's damage is 100% higher.
Shinkuugyoku inflicts Piercing wounds.<br>
<br>
If someone Takes the Hit for Shinkuugyoku, whoever they were defending
will still take 75% damage, so long as the defender received a Major or
greater wound.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Shinkuu Renpa - Wind Release: Vacuum Serial Waves )--<br>
This technique's user takes a deep breath in, and then exhales several
blades of high-sped, chakra-infused wind at varying angles. This
technique's power can vary greatly depending on the amount of chakra
put into the formation of those wind blades, the number created, and
how the user chooses to focus them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20 + 5 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (X *2)d10*7<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12 + X * 2<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
X may not exceed 5.<br>
<br>
Against ninjutsu-based defenses, Shinkuu Renpa is considered one rank
higher, or to deal twice as much damage, as applicable. (For example, a
200 damage Shinkuu Renpa against a 100 damage wall would destroy the
wall and still deal 150 damage to whatever was behind it).<br>
<br>
You may target up to X people with Shinkuu Renpa as a single action.
While the base damage remains the same no matter how many targets you
have, your (ninjutsu damage bonus)*(Shinkuu Renpa's Speed) is divided
by the number of targets.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Fuujin Kokyuu - Wind Release: Wind God's Breath )--<br>
You unleash a wave of chakra converted into gale-force winds, knocking
away everyone and everything around you. So long as the winds remain,
approaching you is exceedingly difficult. At the same time, those winds
will whip any nearby fires into a raging fury.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 32<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Self<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Radius: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Every IC, everyone in the technique's radius is pushed 1 yard away from
you, towards its edge. All Raiton and ranged taijutsu attacks within
this area have their damage reduced by 25%. However, all Fuuton has +3
Accuracy, and all Katon does +15% damage. These effects apply to any
jutsu originating inside, passing through or targeting someone within
the area.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Ama no Yachimata - Wind Release: Crossroads of Heaven
)--<br>
One of the more reliable defensive measure Fuuton users are capable of
deploying, this creates a sphere of whipping winds around them. Aside
from dramatically tossing their hair, causing loose clothes to flap
about, and knocking up loose terrain, this makes a sufficiently skilled
user virtually impervious to most long-range assaults.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 26<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Any ranged taijutsu and Raiton attacks against you with Accuracy less
than (your Accuracy +5) are automatically parried, as are any
projectile-based ninjutsu techniques with an Accuracy less than (your
Accuracy). You may not be grappled while this technique is active.<br>
<br>
This technique uses your base Accuracy for an B-rank Fuuton, unmodified
by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from
Fatigue do apply. Because it is considered to be the technique parrying
incoming attacks, and not you, you cannot modify its accuracy further
(such as with Willpower or AP).<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Fuuton: Higashikaze no Me - Wind Release: Eye of the East Wind
)--<br>
An advanced surveillance technique that, ultimately, falls far short of
the efficacy its designers had hoped for. Once activated, it allows the
users to view air currents, and, for lack of a better term,
'highlights' inconsistent ones--it's something like visual sonar.<br>
<br>
The idea behind the technique was that this would let its user pinpoint
enemies by being able to find their breathing. It's not nearly that
effective in practice, but does offer some benefits to those willing to
adjust to the altered vision it causes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 22<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When performing a Search (in Combat -&amp;gt; Stealth) or Observe
(Ninjutsu -&amp;gt; Bunshin) action, you may use your Chakra
Control skill ranks in place of your Awareness skill ranks, and receive
a bonus of (ninjutsu damage bonus)/3 either way.<br>
<br>
Additionally, when targeted by a Surprise or Sneak Attack, you may make
an Awareness roll (receiving the benefits of this technique's effects)
against a Stealth roll from your opponent; if your result is higher,
their attack is not considered a Surprise Attack or Sneak
Attack.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Kaze no Yaiba - Blade of Wind )--<br>
A rarely-used technique, not because it isn't powerful but because it
doesn't appeal to the sorts of shinobi able to learn it. It's a
high-powered, taxing, close-ranged wind release technique; most shinobi
who prefer close combat will opt for weapons or other elements, and
most wind release users prefer to keep their distance. It has seen some
limited popular of Sunagakure's ANBU.<br>
<br>
The user emits chakra from their fingertips, forming a virtually
invisible &amp;quot;sword&amp;quot; of intense, high-speed
winds, which lasts just long enough to make a single attack with. This
technique leaves very distinctive wounds, deep slashes with hundreds of
miniscule tears at the edges.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30, +20 if it hits<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d8*10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Melee<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 22<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique's damage cannot be blocked, and the effectiveness of an
opponent's damage reduction (if any) is halved. If this technique hits,
it may be used consecutively (no other non-Interrupt actions are taken
between uses). If you do so, its Seal Speed is removed, and its Chakra
cost is reduced to 30 whether or not it hits. However, each attack
(including ones that miss) increases its Upkeep by 3. Once you release
this Upkeep, the blade dissipates.<br>
<br>
Kaze no Yaiba uses only half your actual ninjutsu damage bonus to
determine the damage it deals. For determining wounds, its damage is
considered 50% higher.<br>
<br>

### --( Renkuudan - Compressed Air Blast )--<br>
A technique originated in Sand, supposedly derived from what was
alleged to be a power wielded by a 'monster' that terrorized that
country more than a century and a half ago. The user draws in a deep
breath and begins pouring chakra into the air in their lungs,
thickening it until it reaches an almost-liquid consistency before
ejecting it into a high-power blast of air.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40 + X / 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (2 + X / 2)d12*5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: + X / 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 30 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10 + X, Delay X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
After completing this technique's seals you may use it immediately (as
Speed 10, and Delay 0), or begin 'charging' it.<br>
<br>
X is the number of IC spent charging Renkuudan. Unlike most
variable-speed techniques, you do not need to declare how long you
intend to do this. For example, say you finished the handseals on IC
100. You would then be able to declare you were charging Renkuudan,
without specifying when you intended to stop. On IC 120, an enemy might
begin running towards you; at this point you could stop charging and
fire your technique, with X = 20. X can never exceed 50.<br>
<br>
Renkuudan inflicts Blunt wounds, and the severity of its wounds are
reduced by one category (major to minor, minor to no wound, and so on).
Renkuudan uses double your normal ninjutsu damage bonus for determining
its damage dealt.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Okamaitachi no Jutsu - Scything Wind Technique )--<br>
Almost always used with a fan, this technique creates a vast number of
heavy air currents and vacuum pockets, varying greatly in speed, width,
and angle, with their integrity maintained by chakra. Where they
intersect, the crossing currents tear apart anything unfortunate enough
to be in their way.<br>
<br>
As effective as this technique is, slicing and smashing anything short
of fortified stonework, it can be somewhat unreliable, as there's an
element of chance about just how many different ways a victim will be
shredded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 36<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d10*10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 42<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may target any number of people in front of you, so long as they
are all within range, and for the purposes of evading is considered to
have an Area equal to its Range. Scything Wind's damage is considered
25% higher for the purposes of inflicting wounds.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Shinkuu Taigyoku - Wind Release: Vacuum Great Sphere )--<br>
If the Vacuum Sphere technique can be considered a spray of wind-chakra
bullets (not that ninja actually know what such things are!), then the
Great Vacuum Sphere is a gigantic wind-chakra cannon ball.<br>
<br>
In terms that ninja actually do understand, this creates a large
sphere-shaped vacuum, which is then launched forwards. Anyone who comes
in contact with the vacuum is sucked inside, and then either slammed
against either the first solid object it encounters or just hit by what
amounts to a wall of high-velocity air from every direction as the
chakra in the technique dissipates and the technique collapses on them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 46<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d6*10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 28<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
In addition to targeting anyone in its area, anyone between the user
and its eventual destination is also a target. Shinkuu Taigyoku is
unblockable, and enemies do not receive the benefit of partial defense
against it. Anyone hit is knocked back to the far end of its range.<br>
<br>
Shinkuu Taigyoku inflicts Blunt wounds, and the severity of any wounds
it inflicts is increased by one category (minor to major, severe to
critical, and so forth).<br>
<br>

### --( Fuuton: Taifuu no Me - Wind Release: Eye of the Storm )--<br>
A powerful wind technique, this emanates an incredibly powerful wind,
starting about a foot away from you and pushing away in all directions.
Though not directly harmful itself, it's incredibly difficult to fight
through, and will only grow more so as each wind jutsu you perform
strengthens the storm.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6 + (X)/100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 24<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The tornado provides a Damage Reduction of (your ninjutsu damage
bonus)*10. Any time you use a Fuuton jutsu, this DR is increased by
(the technique's Speed) * (your damage bonus, -2 for each rank the
technique is below A). This DR doesn't apply to Katon, and is
considered 50% higher against Raiton. Non-projectile ranged attacks
(such as Retsudotensho) only have their damage reduced by half the
normal amount.<br>
<br>
X is the current amount of DR this technique is granting you--its
Upkeep steadily increases as its power does. Its primary downside,
however, is the difficulty in dragging a raging tornado along: so long
as it's maintained, the user's movement speed is reduced by 10% for
every 100 DR, to a minimum of 0%.<br>
<br>
ile ranged attacks (such as Retsudotensho) only have their damage
reduced by half the normal amount.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the surge of wind each time this tornado is empowered
pushes enemies (along with anyone and everything else) away from you.
Anyone within (your ninjutsu damage bonus) yards is knocked back (1 per
rank of the jutsu; 1 for E, 5 for A, etc.) * (your ninjutsu damage
bonus)/2 yards.<br>
<br>
So long as this technique's maintained, it's impossible to grapple you
You may choose to end it at will, or when making any Fuuton attack
(whose Chakra roll will still be penalized by Taifuu no Me's upkeep),
adding your total amassed damage reduction to that technique's damage.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuton: Kitakaze - Wind Release: The North Wind )--<br>
The north wind wind cleanses the world of its impurities and soothes
the raging elements. Once its handseals are completed, a calm but
strong wind blows in from the north.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
All environmental effects caused by ninjutsu (such as Yomi Numa, or
Four Pillar Bind) end immediately, and no such techniques may be
activated for double the user's ninjutsu damage bonus worth of IC;
however, this cannot end or disperse B- or A-rank Katon techniques. Any
Ignite status effects have their severity halved (round down), and any
Immobilization with set durations (meaning, ones that fade by a certain
amount every so-many IC) are removed, as is any Paralysis that was
originally caused by a Raiton technique.<br>
<br>
This technique can only be used outside.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
# Katon Ninjutsu<br>
## E-rank<br>
### --( Hinotama no Jutsu - Fireball Technique )--<br>
This jutsu is so weak it's considered a training exercise among academy
students who're quick to grasp the basics of katon jutsu. After
performing the handseals the user focuses chakra in their hand and
projects it into a fist-sized ball of fire, which they can then shoot
at a target.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d6.extra(4)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Asayake no Jutsu - Morning Glow Technique )--<br>
In addition to being good practice for chakra control, many fire-using
ninja find it useful when left without supplies. It creates a small,
warm ball of fire that hovers around its user's palm, over their
fingertips, or so forth. This ball is not hot enough to ignite, well,
anything, but it's particularly bright for its size.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The orb sheds light equivalent to a small oil lamp. This reduces
darkness-based visibilty effects by 3.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Enmaku no Jutsu - Smokescreen Technique )--<br>
A low-level technique which sees some use even by more experienced
ninja, in certain situations. It causes a Katon jutsu to release a
prodigious amount of smoke before it burns out, reducing visibility
over an area.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: +3, +1 per rank above E<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: +4<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique is used in combination with a damage-dealing Katon
jutsu, increasing its Seal Speed and Chakra cost accordingly. The
technique has a radius of 5 yards, +5 yards per rank above E.<br>
<br>
Within this area, the smoke imposes a -3 visibility penalty, +1 per
rank the jutsu Enmaku was used with is above E.<br>
<br>
This technique can also be used on its own, using a person suffering
from the Ignite status as its source; in this case it's Chakra 6, Speed
5, and Seal Speed 5. Every 5 points of Ignite is equivalent to one
jutsu rank (so &amp;quot;rank D&amp;quot;, meaning -4
visibility, at Ignite 10).<br>
<br>
______________________&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Katon: Houenka - Fire Release: Flame Flower )--<br>
After completing the handseals, the user creates three balls of
fire-elemented chakra: one in each palm, and one in their mouth, all
three of which can be fired separately or focused on a single target.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 13<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d6.extra(6), Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 7<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique hits up to three separate targets, and has a +2 bonus to
accuracy. For each fireball beyond the first directed at the same
target, the damage they take is increased by 2d6, and the technique has
+1 accuracy.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Katon: Shitai Entou - Fire Release: Flame Tongue )--<br>
Originally thought to be a technique that required a prolonged diet of
special, possibly chakra-enhanced chemicals, this was later discovered
to be actually a fairly simple Katon jutsu. The user breathes out a
thick, nearly solid stream of fire from their mouth--typically at
another person, whom they would like to injure.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 10d8.extra(7)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Burns 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Enkounebai no Jutsu - Sticky Fire Technique )--<br>
You spit out a mass of chakra-infused saliva; it's clear, odorless,
extremely sticky, very flammable, and kind of gross to get hit by.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 7<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Your opponent is covered in the flammable saliva. If they are hit by a
Katon technique, the saliva ignites, applying an Ignite 5 effect to the
unfortunate victim. The severity of this effect is increased by 2 for
each rank the jutsu is above E (7 for a D-rank jutsu, 9 for a C-rank,
and so forth).<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Nenshou Yari no Jutsu - Burning Spear Technique )--<br>
This jutsu creates a polearm out of pure flame, which the user can hold
unharmed (and without lighting their clothes on fire). Konoha once
tried to have a treaty passed to ban the use of this technique, though
nobody else quite understands what all the fuss is about.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You acquire a naginata or yari made out of fire. It uses your ninjutsu
rather than physical damage bonus. This weapon persists until you let
go of it. Whenever someone is struck by your weapon they must pass a
status roll or suffer burns equal to half its number of rolled dice.<br>
<br>
You may form handseals while holding this weapon, as it is intangible.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Katon: Houyoku - Fire Release: Phoenix Wings )--<br>
This technique wreathes part of your body--generally a forearm and
hand, but it can vary depending on the needs of the technique--with
chakra-based flames! It's quite flashy, and could be considered
low-grade nintaijutsu, as it then combined those flames with a physical
attack of your choice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 5<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
After completing the seals, you perform any non-grapple unarmed
taijutsu attack. The technique uses your ninjutsu, rather than physical
damage bonus, though ignores alterations to the damage bonus (such as
doubling, halving, or removing it). If the opponent fails a status roll
after being hit by this technique, it inflicts Burns 4.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Ryuuseiu no Jutsu - Meteor Shower Technique )--<br>
The user gathers intense fire chakra in their palms or fingertips
before throwing several weapons which ignite in mid-air. Aside from
being painful, being hit by flaming bits of metal carries other risks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 9, +1 per weapon thrown<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As multi-throw<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: As multi-throw<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As multi-throw<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 7<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If the attack hits, make a status roll (Chakra Control vs. the
defender's Resistance). If the defender fails, they suffer an Ignite
with a severity equal to however many weapons hit.<br>
<br>
The weapons used in this technique are ruined, and cannot be retrieved
or reused.<br>
<br>
______________________&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Housenka no Jutsu - Phoenix Sage Fire Technique )--<br>
After performing the handseals, the user exhales a cluster of small
fireballs, each concealing one or more shuriken.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 11, +1 per 2 speed of the multi-throw<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As multi-throw<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: +1d6 per weapon thrown<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: As multi-throw<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As multi-throw<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: The speed of the multi-throw.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique benefits from your ninjutsu damage bonus, on top of the
normal multi-throw damage bonus. Projectiles used in this technique are
rendered unusable afterwards by the intense heat.<br>
<br>
This jutsu adds Burns equal to half the number of weapons thrown.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Goukyaku no Jutsu - Grand Fireball Technique )--<br>
Generations ago, this technique was passed down from father to son
within the Uchiha clan as an informal, but sometimes very serious, rite
of passage. As time passed its use spread first to other Konoha ninja,
and then much further.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 12d12.extra(9)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Radius: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If the victim fails a status roll this inflicts Burns 6.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Ryuuka no Jutsu - Dragon Fire Technique )--<br>
This jutsu is painfully slow and inaccurate, making its usefulness
situational at best. Most users of the technique find some way to bind
or disable their opponents before trying to attack with it. On the
other hand, if it manages to connect it can be astonishing devastating.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 8d20.extra(11)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Burns 8, Ignite 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique benefits from double the user's ninjutsu damage bonus.
If the opponent fails a status roll, the severity of the Burns and
Ignite are both doubled.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Kasumi Enbu no Jutsu - Mist Blaze Dance Technique )--<br>
Once you perform the handseals, this jutsu allows you to exhale a
slightly translucent cloud of potentially flammable gas.&nbsp; Even
so much as a spark will spell trouble for anyone unfortunate enough to
be within it. As an added effect, the glass is ever-so-slightly toxic.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 6d10.open(6)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Radius: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique initially does no damage. However, it detonates and does
the listed damage, across the listed area, if a Katon jutsu contacts
its area, or if a person with an Ignite status of 5 or higher is
present. This explosion cannot be dodged (though the effect which
triggered it, if an attack, can still be dodged or otherwise defended
against normally).<br>
<br>
The gas is also particularly thick, and not particularly breathable.
Every 10 IC that someone spends in the cloud adds a Suffocation 1
status to them.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Yoen no Jutsu - Ember-Burning Technique )--<br>
One of the few katon jutsu which lacks offensive applications, this
technique's rank comes from the precision necessary to perform it
without lighting oneself on fire. It literally burns dirt, grime,
sweat, and contaminants from the target's clothes and body (without,
notably, causing either to go up in flames themselves). It can also be
used to sterilize (or, if necessary, cauterize) wounds by tracing them
with one's fingertips.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Removes all foreign particles and bodies (bugs, chemicals) from the
user's clothes and body, stops any ongoing bleeding, and evaporates any
liquids covering them (exception: this will ignite the D-rank Sticky
Fire Technique). It can even remove recently spilled, not-yet-dried
liquids (including blood!) from clothing. It will not, however, cure
poison.<br>
<br>
This provides a -10 penalty on any attempts to track the user by scent
(i.e. Survival rolls), but only a -5 penalty to find them (i.e.
Awareness vs. Stealth) via scent because while their own odor is
eliminated, this jutsu leaves a faint scent of smoke. In fact, a
difficulty 30 Research roll can identify the use of this technique at,
say, a crime scene.<br>
<br>
If used to treat an injury (external injuries which have left open
wounds only), this accelerates the recipient's healing time by 25%, but
does not stack with the reduction from medical treatment (doctors can
do much better than this improvised first aid).<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Ikari o Moe no Jutsu - Blazing Fury Technique )--<br>
A very, very popular technique among hand-to-hand combatants, whose
opinions of it range from &amp;quot;pretty cool&amp;quot; to
&amp;quot;totally awesome&amp;quot;, this wreathes their hands,
and sometimes feet, elbow, and knees, in a faint reddish glow of
chakra. When they strike, that chakra ignites on impact, resulting in a
burst of flame being delivered to their unfortunate foe. It's quite
flashy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique alters the dice of any unarmed attacks you make,
applying to Unarmed taijutsu, Combo taijutsu, and basic unarmed
attacks. Its damage dice become .extra(3) for d4s, .extra(5) for d6s,
.extra(6) for d8s, .extra(7) for d10s, .extra(9) for d12s, and
.extra(15) for d20s. It does not apply to Grapple taijutsu.<br>
<br>
For example, an attack which would normally deal 8d12 damage would be
changed to deal 8d12.extra(9) damage under the effects of Blazing Fury.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if an attack augmented by Blazing Fury inflicts wounds of
any sort, it also causes an Energy wound of one category lower, to a
minimum of minor (a punch that inflicted a Minor Blunt wound would also
inflict a Minor Energy wound).&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Katon: Karyuu Endan - Fire Release: Fire Dragon Flame Bullet )--<br>
The shinobi gathers chakra in their mouth, before converting it to fire
and shooting it out. The flame shoots out in three sections, each one
taking on the appearance of a serpentine dragon which explodes on
impact with its own target.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 36<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 22d20.extra(11)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Ignite 7, Burns 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 22<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique may target up to three separate people. You may not
direct these 'extra' attacks at the same person for added damage.<br>
<br>
If the victim of this technique fails a status roll, the status effects
are doubled.<br>

### --( Gouryuuka no Jutsu - Great Dragon Fire Technique )--<br>
The user of this technique compresses a large amount of chakra in their
body, and exhales it as a single, massive burst of fire in the shape of
a dragon's head. Due to this technique's nature, enough of the chakra
used in it is retained briefly in the user's body to swiftly prepare a
second blast.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 32<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 15d20.extra(11)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If this was the last jutsu you performed, its Chakra cost is reduced by
4 and its Seal Speed by 2, and it gains +2 Accuracy. These bonuses
stack, bringing it as low as Chakra 16 and Seal Speed 10, and giving up
to +8 Accuracy.<br>

### --( Katon: Joushou Ootori - Fire Release: Rising Phoenix Blast )--<br>
The user gathers chakra around them--the 'rising phoenix' actually
refers to the visible heat ripples and wisps of flame rising around the
ninja performing it-- and unleashes a stream of dark, searingly hot
fire at their opponents. The flames of this technique are hot enough to
disintegrate most incoming attacks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 10d20.open(16)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When used as an Interrupt, Rising Phoenix Blast's damage becomes
10d20.open(11) and it receives double your ninjutsu damage bonus. It
functions differently if when used against a melee attack, or ranged
ninjutsu attack. It may Interrupt attacks so long as its Speed is equal
to or less than theirs (rather than needing to be equal to or less than
half the original attack's Speed).<br>
<br>
Against a melee action: The user may choose to call off their attack,
or press on regardless of the danger. If they do not cancel their
attack, they take Rising Phoenix Blast's full damage, without any
defense. However, you are also hit by their attack automatically, and
cannot defend against it.<br>
If they choose to defend themselves, their attack is cancelled; they do
not pay any Chakra or Stamina costs, and it's considered half its
actual speed for determining when their next action comes; any AP or
other effects spent on it, however, are not regained. They then defend
against Rising Phoenix Blast as a surprise attack, but have a +3 bonus
to any d20 rolls made as part of their defense.<br>
<br>
Against a ranged ninjutsu attack: This can only be used against
targeted, damage-dealing ninjutsu aimed at you, or any damage-dealing
Fuuton ninjutsu which would hit you. Compare the damage of the two
techniques; if the damage of theirs is higher, subtract Rising Phoenix
Blast's damage from that technique's damage; that is how much you take.
If your technique's damage is higher, it destroys the opponent's
technique, protecting you from it, and your enemy must then defend
against your Rising Phoenix Blast (which does its full damage normally).<br>
<br>
Rising Phoenix Blast's damage is raised by 50% if it interrupts (or is
interrupted by) a Wind Release technique, and lowered by 50% when
interrupting Water Release techniques.<br>
<br>

### --( Akuchori Nabe - Devil's Cooking Pot )--<br>
This technique is known for two things. The first is the distinctive,
raspy sound made when the user exhales the dark gray cloud of smoke
produced by this technique, rather like a death rattle. The second is
being wantonly destructive. Due to the composition of the cloud's
chakra, it ignites at the outside first, and implodes upon itself,
creating a pyroclastic pressure-cooker effect.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 28<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Any Katon jutsu of C-rank or higher will be sufficient to ignite the
cloud. This increases that technique's damage by 25% and changes it
dice from .extra() to .open(), and everyone within the cloud's area
must defend against it.<br>
<br>
If the technique also has an area of effect, add half of the lower AoE
(Akuchori Nabe's or that of the technique which detonated it) to the
full higher one; this is the area for the new, combined technique.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Jikoku Kasou no Jutsu - Instant Cremation Technique )--<br>
Arguably the most stylish jutsu in existence, after performing the
requisite handseals the user keeps their hands charged with chakra
(though they do not glow, or burn). From that point on, all they have
to do is point at a target and focus for a few seconds, and a location
will erupt in flames.<br>
<br>
While this does make it somewhat difficult to evade, there are several
telltale signs (aside from the, you know, pointing). The area heats up
rapidly, and there's a low, rising hum near the point where the flash
of fire is imminent, as the chakra being directed there builds and
prepares to ignite.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d20.open(20 - X)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Ignite X/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
After using Instant Cremation, you gain a special Upkeep.<br>
<br>
Special Upkeep: As a normal Upkeep, applies a penalty of its value to
all Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls; you may end it as a Speed 0
action, or immediately after using Instant Cremation. However, it does
not have a limit on how high it may go, and does not interact with
Uniques or Wounds which affect normal Upkeeps.<br>
<br>
Your special Upkeep has a value of X. X increases by 2 each time you
use Instant Cremation. So long as X is 2 or greater, Instant
Cremation's does not require handseals.<br>
<br>
Thus, if you had used Instant Cremation three times, you would have an
Upkeep 6, and your next use of it would deal 4d20.open(12) damage.
Regardless of how high X goes, Instant Cremation may not deal more than
4d20.open(4) damage.<br>
<br>
If you end the Upkeep, and then use Instant Cremation again, the Upkeep
will begin at 0.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Enjoukon no Jutsu - Blazing Soul Technique )--<br>
All ninja learn how to convert their chakra into one of the five basic
elemental natures; doing so is how they perform elemental
ninjutsu.&nbsp; This dangerous, advanced technique takes that to
its (il)logical conclusion. The user converts a majority of their
chakra to fire-elemental.<br>
<br>
This offers the obvious advantage of drastically increasing the
efficiency of any jutsu using that chakra--however, doing so is puts a
significant strain upon one's chakra circulatory system, impeding its
normal functioning.<br>
<br>
When this technique is maintained, a person's skin is notably hot to
the touch.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 25 Chakra Control<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
So long as Enjoukon is maintained, the Chakra costs of all your Katon
jutsu are reduced by 5, and their damage is increased by 15%. When your
Chakra Exhaustion penalty increases from using a Katon technique, it
increases by 1 point less than normal (to a minimum of 0). However, the
chakra costs for all your non-Katon elemental ninjutsu are increased by
5.<br>
<br>
Even after this technique ends, its effects persist for the next 20 IC
as your chakra gradually returns to normal.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Katon: Karyuudan - Fire Release: Fire Dragon Bullet )--<br>
Generally considered to be the pinnacle of how destructive a technique
can be without rendering it useless in a majority of situations, the
user forms a mass of fire in the vague shape of a dragon's head in
front of them, and then fires a volley of blazing projectiles at their
unfortunate target of choice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 60d20.extra(16)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique inflicts Burns of (damage dealt)/50. You may target up
to three people with this technique, using the same Accuracy for each.
You can not target the same person repeatedly to enhance the
technique's effect.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Insei Reisai no Jutsu - Meteor Carnival Technique )--<br>
The go-to jutsu for dispatching swaths of enemies as quickly as
possible, for those who are able to perform it and don't mind ruining
the scenery. Compared to other wide-area techniques, it has the
advantage of, for the most part, being able to avoid hitting one's
allies indiscriminately.<br>
<br>
The user launches an incandescent globe of fire into the sky, where it
remains stationary and periodically launches smaller, roughly
pumpkin-sized exploding fireballs across the battlefield; on impact,
they explode!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 24d20.extra(16)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 150<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 35<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
A volley of fireballs falls upon the battlefield on the IC in which you
use this technique, and every 20 IC afterwards so long as you maintain
its Upkeep.<br>
<br>
This technique uses your base Accuracy for an A-rank Katon, unmodified
by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from
Fatigue do apply. The ninjutsu damage bonus is equal to yours at the
time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the
technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with
Willpower or AP).<br>
<br>
Each volley may target up to (ninjutsu damage bonus) individuals. Each
targeted individual has a fireball fall on them, and detonate with an
Area of (injutsu damage bonus). Each fireball (including the initial
one) is considered a Speed 10 attack, and receives only half your
ninjutsu damage bonus.<br>
<br>
A single individual may only take damage once per volley; if you
targeted four fireballs at each of four people who were standing next
to each other, they would only need to make one defense and would, at
most, take damage one time.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Katon: Ryuujin Bakuha - Fire Release: Dragon King Blast )--<br>
The pinnacle of wide-area indiscriminate destruction. The user exhales
a cloud of not-quite-invisible vapor with a metallic taste, which
rapidly expands. Once they've finished, they channel just a small bit
of chakra into it, turning the gas from inert to violently reactive and
engulfing the area in a fireball which has no peer. The user is
protected from this explosion; their friends, however, are not.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 40d20.open(11)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Effects: Burns 15, Ignite 20, Stun 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: Radius of (Damage Bonus)*10 yards.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30, Delay 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 22<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Every initiative count in the delay, this technique gains 5% of its
damage, radius, and effects. The use of any Katon jutsu of C-rank or
above (or the presence of any person suffering from an Ignite status of
10 or greater) in this area will detonate it prematurely.<br>
<br>
If an effect is used which would disperse the gas cloud (such as the
A-rank Fuuton: Kitakaze) during the Delay period, its damage, range,
and effects all reset to 0%; and can be built back up by continuing it.<br>
<br>
You may choose to detonate this when you finish it (in which case you
will probably be in the area of effect; however, you take only half
damage from your own Ryuujin Bakuha), or not. If not, it'll remain
until detonated by the presence of someone with an Ignite 10, or a
Katon jutsu of C-rank or above.<br>
<br>
Ryuujin Bakuha inflicts an Energy wound, and two Blunt wounds of the
same severity. If it's used in a confined space (such as indoors, or in
a cave) it does an additional 10d20.open(16) damage, and its effects
are raised to Burns 25, Ignite 25, and Stun 20.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Sunde Bakudan - Living Bomb )--<br>
A technique invented in the middle of the Third Shinobi World War--and,
as the horrors from that era go, it's only slightly atrocious.<br>
<br>
The user molds a mass of volatile fire-elemental chakra and, rather
than forming it into a jutsu, injects it directly into a foe. The
chakra will last a few minutes at most, before surging through their
chakra coils violently and turning them into the catalyst for a
powerful explosion.<br>
<br>
It saw extensive use for taking out medics who'd rush to the
battlefield to retrieve injured comrades, only to be killed or wounded
in the ensuing explosion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35, raised to 50 if it hits<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 25d20.open(11)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Whoever you hit with this technique becomes a living bomb! When you
place this technique, you also set a timer, between 1 and (your Chakra
Control skill ranks)*5 IC. At that point, they will detonate. The
initial attack itself does not deal damage.<br>
<br>
You may also perform a Speed 5, Seal Speed 20 action to detonate
someone immediately.<br>
<br>
When a person is detonated, they make a Chakra 30 roll; whether they
pass or fail has no effect on the technique, though as normal they
might advance in Fatigue.<br>
<br>
The explosion itself is Area 25. The bomb themselves may not defend
against it, though anyone else can. The technique's damage is
considered 25% higher for the purposes of wounding the bomb.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Maru o Moyashi no Jutsu - Burning Circle Technique )--<br>
Popular among bounty-hunting ninja, this technique creates a circular
wall of flame surrounding an area. While it's by no means impregnable,
attempting to charge through a virtually-solid sheet of chakra-fueled
fire tends to have the expected result. It's useful both for ensuring
an opponent won't run away (or making them pay for trying to do so),
and for keeping an adversary isolated from the battle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 40d20.extra(6)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Radius: Up to (ninjutsu damage bonus) * 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 26<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This creates a circular wall of flame centered on a location within
range, with the listed radius. The wall itself is 1 yard thick, and
(ninjutsu damage bonus) * 3 yards tall.<br>
<br>
Anyone who crosses the wall takes the listed damage, as well as an
Ignite equal to the user's ninjutsu damage bonus, and a Burn equal to
twice the user's ninjutsu damage bonus. It uses the Speed it was
performed at to determine the damage from its user's ninjutsu damage
bonus. As it does not constitute an attack at that point, defensive
Interrupts can't be used to mitigate it.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
# Raiton Jutsu<br>
## E-rank<br>
### --( Rashinban no Jutsu - Compass Technique )--<br>
It's about what it sounds like. The user channels lightning-elemental
chakra into a needle, or kunai, or similar-sized and -shaped object,
which will then, when laid flat (sometimes requiring a few taps to help
it along) point towards magnetic north.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Allows a single kunai or senbon to be used as a compass for 6 hours or
until used in an attack. It's not quite perfect, but it's good enough
for most uses.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
### --( Shougeki Heki - Shocking Burst )--<br>
Holding a hand out there is a pulse of electricity. This isn't nearly
enough to kill anyone, but it definitely hurts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts Paralyze 1 for 20 IC. It can target either a single
person, or everyone within the range. If the latter, it does not
penalize dodges as a regular area of effect technique would.<br>
<br>
Shocking Burst's Speed may not be reduced below 4.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Shuurai - Lightning Strike )--<br>
You focus energy to the tips of your fingers on either hand, then point
at an opponent, releasing a reasonably sized bolt of electricity. This
is nothing like real lightning, but it looks similar!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d6*3d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts Paralysis 1 for 20 IC if its target fails a status roll.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Juude - Electric Charge )--<br>
Rubbing your hands together you create a large electrical charge, which
only needs the slightest touch to be delivered, and will temporarily
energize the opponent with an amount of lightning-elemented chakra.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Melee<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6 <br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This 'charges' an opponent, and gives the next ranged Raiton technique
used against them an Accuracy bonus of +1, plus the severity of any
Paralysis they have. Thus, when using Raiton against someone with Juude
and Paralysis 3 you'd have a +4 Accuracy bonus.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Jinrai no Jutsu - Thunderclap Technique )--<br>
The user puts both hands together, forming a miniature thunder bolt
between his hands, splitting the air and forming an extremely loud
BANG, which is rather startling when your a few inches from it, and not
expecting it. It has the added benefits of temporarily deafening the
opponent.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10 radius around user<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The Stun's severity is doubled if its victims fail a status roll.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shinkei Attou no Jutsu - Nerve Overloading Technique )--<br>
You send a 'spark' of chakra into an enemy, stimulating any electrical
chakra already in their system and sending them into several seconds of
agonizing convulsions. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This has +3 Accuracy per level of Paralysis on the target. It ends all
Raiton-induced Paralysis effects on them, and inflicts them with a Stun
equal to 5 per severity of the highest Paralysis removed. Thus, someone
suffering from Paralysis 4 would be Stunned for 20 IC.<br>
<br>
\page<br>

<br>
### --( Kyousou Ikazuchi no Jutsu - Racing Thunder Technique )--<br>
By pumping your legs full of lightning chakra, you raise your muscle's
response time, and their power as well. Unfortunately, this is all
focused in just your legs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Your AGI is treated as 25% higher for the purposes of movement.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you may choose to declare a Speed X move action, where X
may be up to your bonus to Stamina rolls. Unlike normal movement (which
is handled on an IC-by-IC basis), the movement for this action is
resolved immediately. However, moving this way has a Stamina cost equal
to the number of yards you travel. You may not reduce this action's
Speed by spending AP.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kaminari no Yaiba - Lightning Blade )--<br>
With a quick burst of lightning natured chakra, you force it through a
metallic weapon and into your enemy, usually during some sort of
attack. This is a burst of energy, rather than a proper chakra flow
technique.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: As Weapon<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As Weapon+5<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This ignores half of any opponent's damage reduction (if any). This
attack counts as a taijutsu attack with your NDB in place of your PDB,
and causes the attack to be treated as a melee-ranged Raiton technique
(for determining the efficacy of jutsu-based defenses and the like).<br>
<br>
If this is parried by a metal weapon, or unarmed (if the person has an
ability to let them do so), the attack still inflicts 20% damage. If
blocked, the blocking has its effect reduced by 10% (from 50% to 40%,
and so forth).<br>
<br>
To use this with a ranged weapon, you need 1 yard of ninja wire
attached to the weapon (which it can be assumed you did in preparation,
or as you perform the technique). For multi-throws, this can rapidly
become an awful lot of wire.<br>
<br>
______________________&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Raikyuu - Lightning Ball )--<br>
Charging up electricity between two weapons, you harness it into a ball
and then fire it at your enemies, the ball exploding out once it makes
contact with anything.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 22<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts Paralysis 2 for 20 IC, and requires you to have a metal
weapon in each hand. This also hits anyone within 3 yards of the target.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kanden Satsujin - Electric Murder )--<br>
You hold out your palms toward the enemy and discharge huge amounts of
lightning chakra, searing the flesh of your enemy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 17<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 30d2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If this technique is the last attack you used, and you haven't
performed any handseals since the last time you used it, its does not
require handseals.<br>
<br>
When used consecutively, add half the damage of all previous
consecutive uses for the purpose of determining wounds. For example,
say you dealt 60, then 40, then 50 damage with it. This would deal a
total of ( 60 + 50 + 40 ) 150 damage. Each consecutive use also
increases its Chakra cost by 1.<br>
<br>
For determining if you wounded your opponent, the first technique would
be treated as 60 damage, the second as (40 + 60/2) 70, and the third as
(50 + 60/2 + 40/2) 100.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kangekiha - Wave of Inspiration )--<br>
Focusing a great amount of lightning chakra into their hands, the user
then places them on or near something that will conduct the attack into
their opponent. Be it something metal, something wet, or whatever, as
long as there is a conductive material, there will be a target who is
hit!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d8*5d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If this is used on a conductive surface (such as a metal pipe, or the
surface of a lake) that your opponent is in contact with, its Accuracy
penalty is removed and your damage bonus is doubled.<br>
<br>
If someone was hit by a Suiton ninjutsu in the past 15 IC, this
technique's Accuracy penalty is reduced to -2, but your damage bonus is
not increased.<br>
<br>
For every point of Paralysis a target is suffering from, the Accuracy
penalty is reduced by 2; however, if this hits their Paralysis status
is ended.<br>
\page<br>

<br>
### --( Taiyouken - Solar Flare )--<br>
Blinds opponents who don't know to close their eyes. Not affected by
doujutsu which bypass visibility penalties, and may in fact temporarily
shut them down.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts a -8 visibility penalty on anyone in range. Used as an
Interrupt, there is a chance the sudden flash of light will cause an
opponent to miss entirely; treat your defense as if you'd rolled a 5 on
a dodge attempt, and if this would allow you to dodge with their
visibility penalty, then they simply miss.<br>
<br>
This negates the effects of any active doujutsu on its victims until
its penalty has faded to -4.<br>
<br>
When you use this technique, you and anyone in range make an opposed
Initiative roll, with the victims getting a +5 bonus for each previous
time this technique has been used in that combat. If you beat their
roll, they're blinded; if not, they managed to close their eyes in time.<br>
<br>
The penalty fades at the rate of 1 per 5 IC.<br>
<br>

### --( Chuubu Gaki no Jutsu - Ghoul Paralysis Technique )--<br>
After making contact with an enemy, you send a powerful pulse of
electricity through their body, momentarily overstimulating their
nervous system. For several seconds afterwards, the recipient of the
shock will find their body sluggish and poorly responsive.<br>
<br>
While not actual harmful, this is exceptionally painful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts Paralysis 2 for 20 IC, raised to Paralysis 4 for 40 IC if
the victim fails a status roll.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Raiton: Fukushuu Kaminarikami - Lightning Release: Avenging
Lightning God )--<br>
You divert your chakra to surge across your skin, building up something
akin to a strong static charge. Unlike actual static electricity, this
is incredibly dangerous.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 18 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d6*2d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: This technique receives only half your
damage bonus.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Any time you are struck by an unarmed melee attack or metallic melee
weapon, this technique 'discharges'. Your attack deals its damage as a
result of their attack, and you must make its Chakra roll again.<br>
<br>
Avenging Lightning God's damage is increased by 10% for every 1 point
of Paralyze the attacker is afflicted by. Additionally, anyone damaged
by this move is afflicted by a Paralyze 1 status for 40 IC. If they hit
you again while still suffering from it, its severity is raised by 1.<br>
<br>
______________________&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Raijuu Hashiri no Jutsu - Lightning Beast Running Technique )--<br>
Charging both your hands with a powerful electric current, you slam
them together and expel a creature made of pure lightning, in whatever
form you choose (one of a realistic, quadripedal animal). The beast
then runs at your enemy, connected to your hands by a lightning 'leash'
that allows you to redirect the attack if an enemy defends against it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d10*3d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Paralysis 2 for 30 IC<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
After seeing the result of your opponent's defense, you may choose to
make them reroll it. If you do this, they keep the second result (even
if it's better). If you use this option, Raijuu Hashiri's damage is
halved for the purpose of determining wounds, and its Paralysis status
is removed.<br>
<br>
You may also use the redirect to send the beast after a different
target; it still suffers the usual reductions this way.<br>
\page<br>

<br>
### --( Raiton Bunshin no Jutsu - Lightning Release Clone Technique )--<br>
This technique creates a power, not-quite-fully independent copy of
yourself. They're capable of bringing substantial force to bear in
combat, but lack enough physical cohesion to survive being hit in
combat. Of course, striking a ball of animated lightning tends to be
bad for one's health.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15, +5 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 100*1d3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Melee <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Paralysis 4 for 30 IC<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8, +4 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12, +4 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can create up to two clones. These function like regular bunshin,
but may take the actions listed below. Additionally, anyone who
destroys a Lightning Clone with a melee attacks takes this technique's
damage automatically. Lightning Clones are all at Fatigue 0; if they
ever reach Fatigue 1, they are destroyed.<br>
<br>
[X AP] Move: Your clones can move, where X is the Speed of the Move
action.<br>
<br>
[4 AP] Basic Unarmed: A basic unarmed attack, using your attributes.<br>
<br>
[X AP] Basic Weapon: You may transfer any number of weapons to your
Raiton Bunshin when you create them. They may attack with those
weapons, using your abilities. X is half the Speed of the attack.<br>
<br>
[X AP] Multi-Throw: Should be self-explanatory. X is half the Speed of
the multi-throw.<br>
<br>
[X AP] Raiton Ninjutsu: The clone must first perform the handseals, at
the regular speed, costing AP equal to half the technique's modified
Seal Speed. It then costs X AP, where X is half the technique's Speed.
They cannot, however, use Raiton Bunshin.<br>
<br>
<br>
When Lightning Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be
Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the
Hold Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for
dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by
one category.<br>
<br>
Lightning Clones use your base Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion bonuses,
as if they were a Fatigue 0 version of you without any temporary
benefits (such as having eaten a Soldier Pill before creating them). If
a clone fails a Fatigue roll, it vanishes just as if it had been struck.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Gian - False Darkness )--<br>
After completing the handseals the user forms a large, spear-shaped
bolt of lightning which can be directed at distant targets. One of this
technique's advantages is its ability to be used in rapid succession,
allowing for rapid long-range bombardment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 75*1d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 35<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Once the technique's seals have been completed, you may repeatedly use
Gian at Seal Speed 0 as long as you take no other ninjutsu or
non-Interrupt actions. Thus, you could dodge, but not punch, and not
used a ninjutsu-based defense.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Raiton: Shichuu Shibari - Lightning Release: Four Pillar Bind
)--<br>
Four pillars of rock, each about twenty feet tall, are summoned around
an enemy (don't ask how that works for a lightning jutsu). Lightning
arcs between the pillars, flooding the area with electricity. While the
damage done by this technique is fairly mild, it can easily immobilize
someone within the area.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d8*3d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA /2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 25 x 25 square<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Paraylsis 5, Immobilize 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique inflicts its statuses on anyone other than the user who
is within its area. They do not end until the victim has managed to
leave. This technique lasts for 60 IC, or until you end the Upkeep,
whichever comes sooner.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Tesura Karui - Tesla Minor )--<br>
This generates a semi-stable mass of lightning chakra which you can
physically throw. It'll 'stick' to the first surface it comes into
contact with (people are not surfaces). Once placed the ball is
stationary, a bright and crackling hemisphere of chakra. Anyone
unfortunate enough to wander into range will receive a face-full of
electricity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Paralysis 2, for 30 IC<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This creates a ball of energy within range on some surface. When it's
created, and every 25 IC afterwards, the ball emits bolts of lightning
at everyone within CHA /2 yards. Each bolt of a lightning is a separate
attack.<br>
<br>
The ball has 10 'charges'; it can attack 10 times, and then it expires.
It will not attack you, and you can specify up to (Chakra Control)/10
other people who it will ignore. The ball can be attacked, and is
destroyed if it takes 100 damage. Melee attacks against it cause it to
discharge against the attacker.<br>
<br>
This technique uses your base Accuracy for an B-rank Raiton, unmodified
by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from
Fatigue do apply. The ninjutsu damage bonus is equal to yours at the
time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the
technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with
Willpower or AP).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Hiyaku Raikoui - Chain Lightning )--<br>
You hold out your fingers and fire a focused bolt of lightning which
then, after striking the target, goes to find a new target, then
another, amplifying itself each time it passes through someone's chakra
circulatory system.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 7d6*1d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 18<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This has an Accuracy bonus equal to the severity of Paralysis its
target is suffering from, +1 for every previous target it's hit. After
hitting one person it can then 'jump' to any other target within half
the original range from its most recent victim, doing 10% more damage
for each target previously hit.<br>
<br>
Anyone struck by this technique has their Paralysis status raised by 1,
and its duration increased by 5 iC. A person can only be hit by a
single use of this technique once.<br>
<br>
The maximum number of targets a single activation of Chain Lightnin can
hit is equal to your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus.<br>
<br>
______________________&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Kouken Rairyuu - Guardian Lightning Dragon )--<br>
Harnessing a great amount of chakra, you create a field of lightning
that swirls around you and coalesces into the crackling outline of an
electric dragon. From there you can keep it at the ready, or attack an
unfortunate foe immediately.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 54<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d8*6d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 80<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Paralysis 3 for 30 IC<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 26<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you use this technique, you may choose to lower its Chakra cost by
10. If you do so, rather than launching at your opponents the lightning
dragon takes shape coiling around you.<br>
<br>
It will automatically attack the first person to move within 10 yards
of you (it will not, however, trigger this effect if you move closer to
them), with +4 Accuracy. If they fail a status roll, its Paralysis
effect will also be double.<br>
<br>
You may also launch the dragon at any time while it's still around, as
a Chakra 35, Speed 14 action, using 14 rather than 26 as its base speed.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Tenchu - Wrath of Heaven )--<br>
This technique earns its name. As the handseals are completed
electricity will begin to arc along the user's body and wisps of dark
smoke will rise from them, a result of the overwhelming, uncontainable
amounts of chakra this jutsu requires.<br>
<br>
That chakra is converted directly into electricity and released in a
blast every bit as devastatingly powerful as a genuine bolt of
lightning.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 70<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d8*5d6*2d4.takeHighest(1)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Paralysis 5 for 50 IC<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 50<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This hits everything in a line ten yards across (its area), and up to
one hundred yards long (i.e. anything between the user and the max
range). The effectiveness of partial defense is doubled against this
technique: for every 1 point it hits by, it deals 10% damage.<br>
<br>
After rolling damage for Tenchu, you may spend a point of Willpower to
reroll it and take the higher of the two results. This may only be done
once per attack, and only if you did not spend Willpower to improve
Tecnhu's Accuracy.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Juurokuchuu Shibari - Sixteen Pillar Bind )--<br>
Just as the four pillar bind, this surrounds the area, though this time
it's a bit more solid. After creating a large, oven-like structure it
then electrocutes the entire area inside, frying the contents and
hopefully making it hard for them to escape.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 58<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d12*3d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 120<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 35 <br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is a 25 x 25 AoE, inside a 50 x 50, inside a 75 x 75, inside a 100
x 100; thus, it's 25 yards from the edge of one layer to the next. For
each layer a person is inside they suffer -2 Immobilize and 1 Paralyze.<br>
<br>
Juurokuchuu Shibari receives only half your ninjutsu damage bonus.<br>
<br>
Thus, someone at the center would be at -8 Immobilize and Paralyze 4,
until they managed to run 25 yards; then they'd be at -6 Immobilize and
Paralyze 3, and so forth.<br>
<br>
This lasts so long as you maintain its upkeep. You are immune to its
effects.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Tesura Shousa - Tesla Major )--<br>
Filling both of your arms with an intense and energetic lightning
chakra, you throw it out onto a surface. This time, instead of a small
ball being produced as in Tesla Minor there is a great spire of
electricity that stays in place, pulsating with energy. These usually
tower over a battlefield and electrocute anything that comes within
range.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 500<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30 <br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The creates a vertical spire of energy on an appropriate surface, CHA/4
yards tall.<br>
<br>
When created, and every 20 IC afterwards, this shocks anyone except you
within (CHA)*3/4 yards. You may designate up to (Chakra Control)/5
other people who will not be targeted by the spire. This attack
receives an Accuracy bonus equal to the severity of the Paralysis
status on its target(s) (meaning that different people may have to
defend against different accuracies).<br>
<br>
The spire has an unlimited number of charges, and 1000 HP. It takes
double damage from Fuuton, half from Doton, and if struck by a
melee-range attack it immediately discharges against the attacker.<br>
<br>
You may 'store' uses of Tesla Minor in the spire, up to a maximum of
CHA/20. These will all discharge at the same time as the spire, gaining
its range but keeping their own damage. For each simultaneous Tesla
strike from the spire (be it a Minor or Major) that strikes someone,
they suffer a Paralysis 1; if the spire and three Minors inside of it
all hit somebody, that person would suffer a Paralysis 4. This lasts
for 10 IC per severity of the Paralysis.<br>
<br>
This technique uses your base Accuracy for an A-rank Katon, unmodified
by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from
Fatigue do apply. The ninjutsu damage bonus is equal to yours at the
time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the
technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with
Willpower or AP).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Raitama - Ball Lightning )--<br>
Upon completion of the handseals the user forms a ball of raw,
condensed lightning chakra between their palms, then encases it in a
more stable 'shell' made from hundreds of interwoven chakra strands,
creating a mesh-like barrier that prevents the inner chakra from
dissipating.<br>
<br>
After that, they can either leave the resulting ball of chakra hovering
where it was made or hide it inside some appropriately sized physical
object, typically the ground, where it will lie in wait until someone
comes close enough to trigger the mine. When they do, it seeks them out
and detonates on contact.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 300<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The mine must be placed within melee range. The technique's actual
range can, if you wish, be set lower than 60. Whenever someone other
than you enters this range, they immediately become the target of a
Sneak Attack from this jutsu; the ball of lightning soars towards them
without warning.<br>
<br>
This can be left sitting in the opponent (as an effective deterrent),
or submerged into any available surface (the floor, the walls). If you
are within the maximum range (even if you reduced the attack range),
you can prevent the ball from activating by concentrating on it (though
you'd typically need line of sight to know if this is necessary).<br>
<br>
If this is hidden inside some object, it cannot be detected without the
use of a chakra-detecting doujutsu (such as Byakugan).<br>
\page_____________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shimeshi Ryouiki - Dampening Field )--<br>
Concentrating your chakra, you project an invisible, wide-area dome of
chakra. Maintaining its stability requires you to stay practically
immobile at its center, but the effects are virtually impossible to
circumvent without finding the originator.<br>
<br>
Anyone who enters the field will instantly notice its presence--their
hair will start to stand on end, and most objects will begin building a
static charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Self<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: CHA *10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 50<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can move up to four yards from your original location while
maintaining this technique; moving (or being forcibly moved) any
further causes it to end.<br>
<br>
Within the field, all chakra-based sensing (such as Byakugan's vision,
chakra-sensory ninja, and the Yurokensei technique) has a -20 penalty.
Electronic and electrical devices in this area are useless. The
dampening also interferes with other lightning-based chakra, reducing
the damage of all Raiton in its range to 80%.<br>
<br>
Finally, the large amounts of ambient lightning chakra interferes with
earth-based chakra. Doton techniques in this area have their damage
reduced by 25%, and their Chakra costs and Upkeeps (if relevant)
increased by 4.<br>
<br>

# Suiton Ninjutsu<br>
## E-rank<br>
### --( Suisaishuu no Jutsu - Water-Gathering Technique )--<br>
No matter its advantages, it can't be denied that water suffers from
one potentially crippling flaw: water is, in most environments, not
widely available in the quantities needed for prolonged used of suiton
jutsu.<br>
<br>
This technique partially circumvents that problem by gathering water
scattered around the battlefield and using it as part of a technique.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: +4<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is used to supplement a technique which uses water, and increases
that technique's Seal Speed by 4 and Chakra cost by 5. You may use any
water that's previously been used in the battle to fuel your technique.<br>
<br>
For example, you and your opponent both enter battle with a 4 gallon
gourd. Your opponent begins by using a water ninjutsu which requires 4
gallons of water. You then use an 8-gallon technique of your own,
combined with Suisaishuu, to use the (previously-expended) 4 gallons
and your own 4 gallons.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Mizudama no Jutsu - Water Sphere Technique )--<br>
The user gathers the water used in this technique in front of them as
they perform the handseals, and then directs it at an opponent as a
high-speed projectile.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 7<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 2 gallons of water<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Mizuhane - Water Splash )--<br>
You strike the ground with your foot, and cause a spray of water to
splash up between you and an attacker. It's not terribly practical, but
it does provide about a quarter-second of a distraction.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 4 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is used alongside a Dodge action, and provides it with a +3 bonus.
It may be used with ambient (&amp;quot;already spent&amp;quot;)
water, without needing to gather it via Water Gathering Technique.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>

You use Splash!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5<br>

Nothing happens!<br>
<br>
______________________&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Suiton: Teppoudama - Water Release: Liquid Bullet )--<br>
The user kneads chakra and converts it into water inside their stomach,
then spits it out in the form of a dense, chakra-propelled ball. Its
greatest boon to suiton users is that it can be used in an area without
any preexisting water.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 6d8+15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 9<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This adds 3 gallons of water to the battlefield every time it's used.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Takigakure Ryu, Mizukiri no Yaiba - Hidden Waterfall Style,
Water-Cutting Blade )--<br>
Originally developed by the Hidden Waterfall village, this technique
has since spread into wider use. The first half of the name is
generally dropped, though some choose to keep it out of respect. The
jutsu creates a blade out of water, kept as strong as most metals by
the chakra infusing it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 4 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You acquire a sword, with the appropriate attributes for any of the
ones in the Equipment chapter. Attacks with this sword use your
physical or ninjutsu damage bonus, whichever you prefer. The water used
in this technique cannot be reused (via Suisaishuu no Jutsu) so long as
the sword is maintained. This sword lasts until you let go of it.<br>
<br>
You may perform handseals while holding this sword, but doing so
increases the Seal Speed by 6, unless you can form seals one-handed.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kirigakure no Jutsu - Hidden Mist Technique )--<br>
This technique was once a specialty of the village it's named after,
but has since fallen into wider use. The user diffuses a large quantity
of water into the air, mixing their chakra with it to create a thick,
oppressive mist.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 50 yard radius<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 20 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This imposes a -8 visibility penalty to everyone in the area. After you
stop paying the upkeep, the mist's penalty fades at a rate of 1 per 10
IC.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suiton: Namerakana Amamizu - Water Release: Rainwater Slick )--<br>
The user splashes a small area with water, infusing it with their
chakra. This layer of chakra causes the water to support a person's
weight for just long enough that when it gives out, they'll risk
slipping and falling embarrassingly. Anything coated in this is,
similarly, hard to hold on to.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 9<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Make a Chakra Control roll when you first lay down this technique, with
a +5 bonus.<br>
<br>
Anyone who moves while in this area must make an Athletics check
against that number or be tripped (as per the E-rank Taijutsu move).
Alternately, they may move at half speed and bypass that. Someone able
to walk on water can move at only three-quarters speed, and still not
risk tripping.<br>

### --( Mizutamari no Jutsu - Pool of Water Technique )--<br>
A moderately advanced technique is the appropriately named
water-walking technique; molding chakra below one's feet to 'stand' on
patches of water without any actual expenditure of energy, and, once
it's perfected, only minimal concentration. This technique builds upon
that concept, creating a 'cushion' of static, almost-solid water
beneath each foo that the ninja stands on to avoid direct contact with
the ground.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 2 gallons of water, 8 Chakra Control<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The water used in this technique is considered part of its upkeep; that
is, it can't be altered, reused, or stolen by other people, or
yourself, while this technique is maintained (due to your chakra in
it!).<br>
<br>
You reduce any immobilization penalties due to the condition of the
ground you're crossing by 4, and ignore any other mechanical effects
(such as damage for walking across caltrops) if they're C-rank or
lower; if they're B-rank above, you instead halve them. This does mean
that you are not directly in contact with the ground (for the purposes
of, say, the Doton jutsu Shindou and Yurokensei).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Gyoushuu no Tebukuro - Gloves of Cohesion )--<br>
You mold chakra around your palms to maintain a thick film of water
around them, similar to how it's possible for a ninja with excellent
chakra control to stand on walls, or, well, water. This uses an
extension of that sort of chakra control, using the water film as a
medium to latch on to other people.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 1 gallon of water, 10 Chakra Control<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This gives you a +4 bonus to all grapple checks you make, for any
purpose other than escaping a grapple. This technique can be used
without handseals, though doing this changes it to Speed 10.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Mekkyaku - Extinguishment )--<br>
It was recently discovered that covering oneself in water is a highly
effective countermeasure to being on fire! Thus, this technique: An
alternative to the ever-popular &amp;quot;stop, drop, and
roll&amp;quot;, the ninja drenches themselves or a nearby object in
water.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: X gallons of water, X Chakra control<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This reduces any Ignite penalties you are suffering from by X/2. You
have control over the water used in this technique for the next (Chakra
Control)*2 IC, as if you'd carried it into battle with you via a gourd
or something similar, or until you use it in a
jutsu.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
\page<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Suiton: Suikoudan - Water Release: Water Shark Blast )--<br>
After creating the handseals, you launch water in projectile form at an
opponent. Some ninja like to etch the outline of a shark's head into
the end of this projectile; others, who believe that being a ninja is
very serious business, prefer to omit that part of the technique.
Experienced users can even use this to allow themselves to fly quickly
through the water, while protecting themselves with the might of the
tearing shark.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 8d12+45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 13<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 8 gallons of water <br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique travels in a line from you to its target (or its maximum
range). You may move to any location along that line as part of this
technique, unhindered by anything which would normally prevent you from
moving.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suiton: Mizurappa - Water Release: Violent Water Wave )--<br>
Inhaling a large amount of air and performing the necessary seals, the
user will expel a copious amount of water from his/her mouth.&nbsp;
The wave of water produced will slam against it's opponent and can then
be utilized for other techniques.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 6d10+30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique adds 5 gallons of water to the battlefield every time
it's used.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### ### ### --( Suiton: Suiben - Water Release: Water Whip )--<br>
This creates, as its name suggests, a whip made from water which is
held together by chakra. Aside from being a fairly useful weapon, it
can prove useful for binding enemies, as the user can direct its
motions with their chakra.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6 to create<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 11<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 6 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may attack with the whip, which is a Speed 10 action, Range 8,
Damage 6d10, Chakra 12 and uses the higher of your physical or ninjutsu
damage bonus. You must keep one hand on the whip at all times, or it
will break apart into so much water.<br>
<br>
As a separate Speed 10 action, you may use the whip to grab hold of
someone, as per the E-rank Grapple technique. You use your CHA rather
than your STR for grapple checks using the whip. Your opponent is
considered to be 'grappling' the whip. Although they cannot attack it
directly, the whip has (your CHA)/2 HP, and can be attacked (or suffer
from being struck by an AoE) by outside sources. The whip being
destroyed ends the grapple. Your whip cannot be attacked if it is not
being used to grapple someone. The victim cannot shift this grapple,
only break it.<br>
<br>
You can then proceed to perform any valid Grapple techniques which you
know, of C-rank or below, using your CHA in place of your STR. This is
accomplished by using your chakra to reshape the whip. The following
techniques may not be used by the whip: Headbutt, Suplex, Pressure
Point.<br>
<br>
You may still perform handseals while holding the whip, but it
increases their seal speed by 8 unless you have the ability to perform
handseals one-handed.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you may direct Raiton techniques through the whip. This
may be done with techniques of E- and D-rank. It may done with a C-rank
technique, but doing so destroys the whip in the process. These
techniques cannot miss.<br>
<br>

### ### --( Suiton: Mizuame Nabara - Water Release: Syrup Capture Field
)--<br>
The user converts chakra into water, and infuses it with enough chakra
to alter its composition, making it extremely viscous. They then spit
it out in a stream of sticky, highly adhesive liquid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 5 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This covers a circular area, and its cost may be increased to widen
that area's radius. If a person has the ability to walk on water, they
may cross this area without difficulty.<br>
<br>
However, if someone is forced into it (such as by being pushed back by
certain jutsu), or is already in the area (i.e. it's targeting them and
they fail to dodge), they are stuck in the syrup. Anyone in the area
suffers a -4 immobilization penalty, and additionally has their
movement speed halved.<br>
<br>
This jutsu's effects persist even after the upkeep stops being paid.
However, so long as the upkeep is maintained, the user may control the
syrup enough to have it try to 'grab' anyone using water-walking to
cross it unaffected; if the attack hits, the person is stuck in the
syrup as if they weren't using water-walking.&nbsp; This is a Speed
6 action, with a Chakra cost of 10.<br>
<br>
Due to the alterations to this water to make it highly viscous, it
cannot be used later to fuel other suiton techniques.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Mizu Souzou no Jutsu - Water Creation Technique )--<br>
You convert raw chakra into pure water. This technique is popular among
serious users of suiton techniques, as it lets them avoid picking and
choosing their battles so carefully, and allows them to eschew the
practice of carrying around large gourds of water (which, in addition
to giving away their specialty, are unpleasantly heavy).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5 + 2 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: X<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You create X gallons of water. This may be used alongside a technique,
in which case its speed is 0, and its cost and seal speed are added to
that technique's, and it contributes directly to that techniques
gallons requirement. It may also be used alone, in which case the
created water is deposited on the battlefield (and must be gathered via
a method such as Suisaishuu).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Mizu Bunshin no Jutsu - Water Clone Technique )--<br>
An advanced form of the standard Bunshin no Jutsu, this creates clones
out of water. Since they're solid (well, relatively) these clones can
be used to perform tasks the user is unable or unwilling to do for
themselves. While they're weaker than their user, they can still prove
dangerous in combat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10, +3 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6, +1 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4, +2 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 4 gallons per clone<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
These function like normal clones, but you may direct them to take
actions by spending your AP. They may use basic unarmed attacks, or
basic weapon attacks (weapons can be added to clones when they're
created for 1 gallon per 5 dice of weaponry). These clones use your
regular attributes, but use your ninjutsu damage bonus as their
physical damage bonus. A water clone which takes damage from any source
is destroyed.<br>
<br>
[1 AP] Dodge, or Parry.<br>
<br>
[Variable AP] Move: The clone may move around the battlefield. This
costs 1 AP per 2 IC it spends moving.<br>
<br>
[Variable AP] The clone may make any basic unarmed or weapon attack, by
paying 1 AP per 2 Speed of that action.<br>
<br>
[10 AP] The clone can use itself to create a water prison (as per
Suiton: Suirou no Jutsu). This is considered a Speed 14 action, and you
must pay the Chakra cost. These water prisons require no additional
water; the clone remains present, but can take no other non-defensive
actions, while maintaining them. They last for 5 + (your Chakra Control
ranks) IC, after which the clone expires and the prison ends; if you go
to the prison you can take it over, and from then on must keep one hand
in contact with it as per the normal rules for that technique. When the
prison ends, the clone is destroyed.<br>
<br>
<br>
When Water Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be
Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the
Hold Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for
dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by
one category.<br>
<br>
Water Clones use your base Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion bonuses, as if
they were a Fatigue 0 version of you without any temporary benefits
(such as having eaten a Soldier Pill before creating them). If a clone
fails a Fatigue roll, it vanishes just as if it had been struck.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Mizugakure no Jutsu - Hidden in Water Technique )--<br>
The user sinks into a shallow pool of water, much too little to
actually fit a person (it's ninja magic, don't ask questions), where
they'll be able to easily lie in wait for a target to pass by, or spy
on someone who might be near.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Performing this jutsu requires a sizable puddle (at least two gallons
worth if you're pouring out the water, though if there was recent
rainfall, it's assumed you can find such a puddle without much
difficulty). If at least 50 gallons of water have been used in a fight,
it's assumed there's enough water around somewhere to use this.<br>
<br>
You can hide (assuming you meet one of the normal three requirements
for hiding), and immediately enter Stealth 3 when hidden. If an
opponent does not have a reason to suspect you're there (i.e. this
isn't being done in-combat) you have a +5 Stealth bonus. You have
awareness equivalent to being able to look out of the pool as if it's a
window.<br>
<br>
The puddle being destroyed or evaporated, or washed away in more water,
results in you being harmlessly ejected.<br>
<br>
Notably, this can only be used in puddles; anything more than a few
inches deep probably doesn't qualify. If it's an actual pond, or lake,
or the like, it's not a valid target.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suiton: Suirou no Jutsu - Water Release: Water Prison Technique
)--<br>
The user gathers the chakra around their hand, and forms the required
water into a sphere which encloses its victim. Due to the density of
the chakra used in this technique, the water is stronger than steel. It
is not, however, airtight.<br>
<br>
Yeah, don't ask how that works. We don't know either.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 12 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects: <br>
If this jutsu strikes, the victim is trapped inside a sphere of water.
People inside cannot take actions, but they also cannot be affected by
anything outside the prison; yes, that's right, the water can even stop
giant swords. It makes sense, honestly, we promise, somehow.<br>
<br>
Anyone with a Chakra Control skill of 5 or above is able to mold the
chakra around them to allow themselves to siphon air through the
prison, meaning they can still talk and breathe. Anything with less,
however, adds a Suffocation 1 status every 10 IC.<br>
<br>
To maintain the water prison, you must keep one hand on it. Dodging
requires you to end the effect; if you take damage, you must make a
Chakra Control check against (damage taken)/10 or the prison ends.
Although you can't move, you can still take most other actions that are
possible one-handed while maintaining the prison's upkeep.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Umi no Tate no Jutsu - Ocean Shield Technique )--<br>
A derivative of a more advanced technique, this was created to help
teach up-and-coming suiton users the foundations of that jutsu, and
help keep them alive until they were skilled enough to learn it. It
creates a circular barrier of water around you, which surges up to
protect you from... well, whatever convinced you that you'd need to use
this technique.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 17<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 10 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Make an accuracy roll against an incoming attack, with a bonus of your
ninjutsu damage bonus. This technique's Accuracy bonus can't exceed its
final, modified Speed (not including any increases in Speed from the
Paralysis status).<br>
<br>
If you meet or exceed the attack's accuracy, you protect yourself from
it completely. This works against Katon up to B-rank, Doton up to
D-rank, and all other jutsu (including taijutsu) up to
C-rank.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Suiton: Suigadan - Water Release: Water Fang Bullet )--<br>
This move forms multiple pressurized, spiralling columns of water that
have a drill-like ability to pierce and destroy their target. As this
attack can originate from any body of water (rather than being shot
directly from the attacker), in the right environments this has a 360
degree range of attack, making it incredibly difficult to defend
against adequately.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 34<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 10d20+60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 22 gallons<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If there are at least 50 gallons of water on the battlefield (or one
is, say, over a lake, river, or other body of water), this technique is
automatically a Surprise Attack, and the water it uses does not have to
be gathered in advance. This technique inflicts Piercing wounds.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suiton: Suiryuudan - Water Release: Water Dragon Blast )--<br>
This technique shapes a large amount of water into a giant,
dragon-shaped projectile which seeks out and crashes into whoever you
direct it at. What it lacks for in complexity, it makes up for by being
a highly effective tool in any suiton-using shinobi's arsenal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 33<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 14d20+140<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 24 gallons of water<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Sution: Suijinheki - Water Release: Water Encampment Wall )--<br>
This defensive technique creates a wall of water around you, which
forms a violently churning defensive perimeter. When lacking water in
the environment to use, a talented shinobi can form it in their stomach
and spit it out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 26<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 16 gallons of water, or +8 chakra cost
without using water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If using Suijinheki as an interrupt: Make an accuracy roll against the
attack's accuracy, with a bonus equal to your ninjutsu damage bonus; if
you succeed, this stops the attack entirely. This technique's Accuracy
bonus can't exceed its final, modified Speed (not including any
increases in Speed from the Paralysis status).<br>
<br>
Once Suijinheki has been deployed, it lasts for your damage bonus in
initiative counts--it stops any other incoming attacks automatically,
without having to roll. You may also end it early, if you need to move
or attack through it.<br>
<br>
This technique protects you from any Katon up to A-rank, Doton up to
C-rank, and all other techniques (including taijutsu) up to B-rank.<br>
<br>
If you create the water used in Suijinheki (i.e. pay the +8 chakra
cost), then that water is added to the battlefield after its duration
expires.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suiton: Bakusui Shouha - Water Release: Exploding Water
Shockwave )--<br>
The user creates an enormous amount of water by spewing it from their
mouth, flooding the battlefield and potentially crushing foes in its
path. Best of all, they get to look awesome while doing it! The wave
rises up from beneath the user, and they can 'ride' it to its
destination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 10d12+80<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Cannot be dodged. Stun 8.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16, cannot be reduced below 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This adds 50+(ninjutsu damage bonus)*5 gallons of water to the
battlefield.&nbsp; When performing this technique, you may move up
to half its Area in yards, in any direction. The Area itself is
centered on where you start your movement.<br>
<br>
Anyone other than yourself within a yard radius equal to the number of
gallons takes damage from this technique.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Benzaiten no Jutsu - River Goddess Technique )--<br>
Named after the deity who supposedly watches over a major river, this
technique coats the user's body with a thin layer of chakra-infused
water. It offers no real protection from impacts or weapons, but can be
an effective supplement to one's defenses against heat and other
unpleasantness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 23<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 12 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
So long as this is maintained you cannot be affected by Ignite or Burn
statuses, and you take 25% less damage from Katon jutsu (applied after
other reductions). Activating it will end any ongoing Ignites
harmlessly, but will not cure Burns.<br>
<br>
You may use the water in this technique to fuel any Suiton jutsu you
use, though doing so ends its effect--but, does allow you to avoid
sufferings Benzaiten's Upkeep on that jutsu's Chakra roll.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suiton: Takitsubo no Jutsu: Water Release: Waterfall Basin
Technique )--<br>
This technique draws water up from underground, forming a geyser on the
surface. Aside from being useful for creating a spot to relax when
resting or camping out, and ensuring you'll always have a source of
clean (well... for a certain value of clean) water, it, like most
ninjutsu, has combat applications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 18<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This produces 2 gallon of water on the battlefield every 3 IC, for a
total of 50 gallons over 75 IC. It's certainly possible to have
multiple instances of this jutsu running simultaneously, from multiple
people, or the same person.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suiton: Suishi no Jutsu - Water Release: Water Drowning
Technique )--<br>
An advanced version of the ever-popular Water Prison Technique, this
remedies the greatest flaw in that technique: a lack of lethality. It
does... about what it says. In terms of appearances, it's almost
identical to a regular water prison.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 28<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 16 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This follows all normal rules for the Water Prison Technique, with the
following exceptions.<br>
<br>
The victim suffers from Suffocation 1 every 5 IC regardless of their
Chakra Control. By spending 1 Willpower, they are allowed a
1d20+CHA/10+(5 per Fatigue category) roll against your
1d20+CHA/10+(ninjutsu damage bonus). They also get one such check
whenever they advance a Fatigue category inside the prison, and when
you first strike them with it. Success means they break free.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Hijutsu: Kirisame - Secret Technique: Mist Rain )--<br>
This technique causes it to start raining over a small (well, for...
rain) area. This rain is chakra-infused, and will siphon away any
chakra which doesn't match its own (in other words, its creator's);
fallen rain evaporates rapidly, only to fall again, and shrouds the
area in a thick mist.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 32<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 120 yards<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 32 gallons of water, or +10 Chakra cost<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Any jutsu which is used inside the mist, or includes the mist as any
part of its area, acts as if its user's ninjutsu damage bonus is 0 for
any associated damage calculations. Additionally, being inside the mist
causes a -8 visibility penalty. You suffer only half the normal
visibility penalty from your own Mist Rain.<br>
<br>
The water used in this technique is returned to the battlefield after
you end its upkeep. If you created the water (i.e. paid the +10 Chakra
cost), then 32 gallons are added to the battlefield. Water that's part
of this technique can't be used for other purposes while it's ongoing.<br>
<br>
If you move, you may cause the mist to 'follow' you; it can move up to
half your ninjutsu damage bonus in yards per IC, so long as you remain
within it.<br>
<br>
If this mist has its visibility penalty reduced (such as by the E-rank
Fuuton, Cleansing Winds) then it regains 1 point of its penalty every 5
IC that pass. On the other hand, effects which remove it entirely (such
as the A-rank Fuuton, The North Wind) will, indeed, remove it. If Mist
Rain ends because you stop paying the Upkeep, it will remain for the
next 20 IC (as the rain finishes falling) before finally, truly ending.<br>
<br>
This technique may only be used outside.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Suiton: Suiryuuben - Water Release: Water Dragon Whip )--<br>
This jutsu creates a levitating orb of water which can project numerous
whips and tendrils of water. These tendrils can be guided to targets by
remote manipulation of the orb's chakra, even changing direction in
mid-trajectory to find their targets. On top of that, they're
sharp-tipped and more than capable of perforating opponents many times
over.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 10d10+75<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 40 + 5 * (ninjutsu damage bonus)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 200 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
So long as you maintain this technique, your pet giant levitating ball
of water will fight for you! It can take the following actions, by
spending your AP:<br>
<br>
[X AP] Move: Your pet water ball can fly around and stuff! It moves as
if it had taken a Speed (X)*5 action, using your CHA in place of its
AGI. It cannot (deliberately) move outside its max range. If it does
end up outside that range, it can take no actions other than moving
towards you.<br>
<br>
[5 AP] Attack: Your water ball attacks anyone within half this
technique's max range, doing the listed damage if it hits. It uses your
accuracy, with your CHA/10 in place of DEX/10. This does piercing
damage. You may target any number of people within range, increasing
the AP cost by 1 for each person after the first. This receives your
damage bonus as if it was a Speed 10 action. This does Piercing damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
This technique uses your base Accuracy for an A-rank Suiton, unmodified
by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from
Fatigue do apply. The ninjutsu damage bonus is equal to yours at the
time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the
technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with
Willpower or AP).<br>
<br>
<br>
This technique cannot be converted into an advanced chakra nature (such
as Mokuton).<br>

### --( Suiton: Daibakufu - Water Release: Great Waterfall )--<br>
This is one of the most powerful water ninjutsu in existence; once the
appropriate seals are formed, the user unleashes a devastating tidal
wave which tears across the battlefield like a scaled-down tsunami,
knocking aside people, trees, and small buildings in its path.<br>
<br>
Long ago, exceptionally skilled shinobi were able to fill their
impromptu waterfall with all manner of weapons, which were propelled
within the wave at incredible speeds. This had the effect of making it
an almost unavoidably deadly technique that would leave pools of blood
mixed in with the water. However, use of that aspect of the technique
was forbidden due to its unbelievable power, and as peace settled
across the lands the secret of how to do that was lost.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 52<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 24d20+300<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 80<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 20 wide, up to max range in length; may be
used as a smaller area if you wish<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 36<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 60 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
40 of the gallons used in this technique are removed from the
battlefield, scattered as a fine mist over the area; if the gallon
requirement is somehow removed, this technique's Chakra cost is
increased by 8.<br>
<br>
Blocking reduces this technique's Stun by half.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suiton: Daikoudan - Water Release: Great Shark Blast )--<br>
This creates an enormous shark out of water and sends it crashing
across the battlefield at whichever party has offended the user
sufficiently for them to feel the need to do so. Aside from impacting
its primary target, the shark is massive enough to cause significant
collateral damage.<br>
<br>
The technique's true secret, however, is its ability to absorb any
chakra it comes in contact with and use that energy to further empower
itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 44<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 15d20+200<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 26<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 40 gallons of water<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If used as an Interrupt, you may choose to reduce this technique's Seal
Speed by 10 and increase its Chakra cost by 10. Used as a normal
attack, it does full damage to a single target, and half damage to
everyone within its Area who doesn't defend against it.<br>
<br>
As an Interrupt, it can be used to counter any ranged ninjutsu attack.
Daikoudan may be used to Interrupt techniques so long as its Speed is
equal to or less than theirs. The two attacks collide, and their damage
is compared. For this comparison, treat Katon technqiues as dealing 25%
less damage, and Doton as dealing 25% more.<br>
<br>
If the incoming attack does more damage, you are hit by it, but it has
its damage reduced by half.<br>
<br>
If Daikoudan's damage is greater, it becomes an attack against the
opponent with +5 Accuracy, along with any Accuracy bonuses (but not
penalties) of the attack it countered. It does an additional (X)*10
damage, where X is the Chakra cost of the move it countered.<br>
<br>
Similarly, if a ninjutsu-based defense is used against Daikoudan, and
fails to stop it completely, it does full damage (bypassing even
partial defense) and adds (X)*10 damage, with X being the Chakra cost
of the failed defense.<br>

### --( Suiton: Dai Bakusui Shouha - Water Release: Great Exploding
Water Shockwave )--<br>
A stronger version of the B-rank Exploding Water Shockwave, the user
spits out a truly prodigious amount of water.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 55<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 7<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 150<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 32<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This adds 200+(ninjutsu damage bonus)*20 gallons of water to the
battlefield.&nbsp; So long as there are at least 200 gallons of
water on the battlefield, any techniques which function by altering the
condition of the ground (such as Syrup Capture Field, or Retsodotensho)
are effectively useless. In Dai Bakusui Shouha's area, there is always
considered sufficient water to use jutsu without having to resort to
using Water-Gathering (it essentially creates a small lake).<br>
<br>
The water created forms a flattened orb over the affected area, with
the user anchored at its center. So long as the upkeep is maintained,
this water will follow them, and the below effects will be maintained
(when the upkeep ends, so do they, as the water disperses over a much
larger area; it remains usable, but isn't a mobile lake).<br>
<br>
Additionally, anyone who can't stand on water will begin sinking. They
can swim at half their normal movement speed (movement-increasing jutsu
typically will not work), and until they've exited the area suffer
Suffocation 1 every 10 IC. Alternately, they can take a Speed 5 action
to stay at the surface for the next 15 IC.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Suiton: Uramiame - Water Release: Grudge Rain )--<br>
As a weather-manipulation jutsu, this technique is extremely taxing
upon its user. Upon its completion a large storm cloud is created,
which proceeds to, as storm clouds are prone to do, rain. This rain
saps the chakra from anyone it comes in contact with, and transfers it
through the pooling water to the technique's user.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 24<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Every 2 IC, everyone other than the user and up to (Chakra Control)/5
people they've designated as allies has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty
increased by 1, and the user has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty
decreased by 1 per person present affected by the rain. This remains
centered on the user as they move.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
# Medical Jutsu<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Mukizu Shindan no Jutsu - Flawless Diagnosis Technique )--<br>
By touching someone and sending pulses of chakra throughout the
recipient's tenketsu, the user can learn of someone's vitals and
condition faster than it would be to separately evaluate
them.&nbsp; It requires the patient be willing to do so, however,
which is the cause of most medic-nin's stress while in training.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8, Delay 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You know a target's Fatigue level, percent of remaining HP and
Vitality, any wounds they're suffering from, any illnesses they have,
any poisons they're afflicted with, and any other health issues they
may be suffering from.<br>
<br>
These are in general terms. Your character knows they are
&amp;quot;exhausted, but still have some energy left&amp;quot;,
not that they &amp;quot;are at Fatigue 4&amp;quot;.<br>
<br>
In addition to telling you what's wrong with a person, this gives a +5
bonus to any Medicine rolls to treat a person using mundane means (such
as a First Aid kit).<br>
<br>
This cannot be used against an unwilling target. Well; it can't be used
on an unwilling target who is also capable of resisting.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kyuusho Shuuzen no Jutsu - Vital Repair Technique )--<br>
By transferring your chakra to the recipient, you can stimulate the
body to begin the recovery process and help stabilize their most basic
functions (like breath rate and pulse).&nbsp; It lacks the
precision of more advanced jutsu to target specific injuries and
problems, but helps to keep people alive until they can receive
advanced care.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5 + X * 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Abort<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Flawless Diagnosis<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
For the duration of this technique, you must keep your hands on its
recipient. If you are stunned, or knocked away, it is Aborted
automatically. The value of X is determined, and the Chakra cost paid,
after it ends.<br>
<br>
For every IC which passes, you heal 5 of the recipient's lost Hit
Points. This will not restore lost Vitality, though it will restore a
person in negative Hit Points to consciousness.<br>
<br>
You pay the cost of this technique after you finish healing, based on
its actual duration. If you Abort it, or are forced to, X is reduced
appropriately.<br>
<br>
A single person may benefit from this only once per day, per medic. You
may use this technique on yourself (though still have to be able to
place a hand on yourself to do so; no hands, no healing).<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Shiketsu no Jutsu - Tourniquet Technique )--<br>
A surprisingly medical technique, this throttles the flow of chakra to
a specific portion of the body, and by doing so puts it in a state of
near-hibernation. The entire limb becomes numb and almost unresponsive,
but blood flow decreases and pains is significantly reduced.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2 per limb<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15, Delay 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Flawless Diagnosis<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This jutsu can be applied to any limb. The recipient loses the use of
that limb, but ignores all effects of any wounds present on it.<br>
<br>
In the case of an arm that means it cannot be used to hold weapons, the
amount of weapons you can multi-throw is reduced by 25%, and you cannot
use that hand to form handseals.<br>
<br>
In the case of an leg this applies a -25% to movement speed and a -1
dodge penalty.<br>
<br>
This technique cannot be used offensively. You can, however, use it on
yourself.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Chakura no Mesu - Chakra Scalpel )--<br>
This forms one's chakra into a small, sharp blade; medics favor this
for performing highly accurate incisions during surgeries and
dissection, as it won't lose its edge and is always sterile (unlike a
regular blade). It can even be used to make cuts inside the body
without creating an opening wound, which drastically reduces the risk
of infection.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can use this in combat. Doing so causes your basic unarmed taijutsu
attacks to inflict Slashing wounds and ignore any damage reduction your
opponent may have. However, these 'scalpel' injuries are relatively
shallow. They cannot injure a location wearing armor, and do not damage
armor when they strike it.<br>
<br>
The more skilled a medic is, the more effectively they'll be able to
weaponize what's meant to be a surgical technique. The damage from
Chakra Scalpel attacks is increased by (your Medicine skill ranks)%.
Aditionally, its damage (after that increase) is increased by (Medicine
skill ranks)% for determining the severity of wounds it inflicts.<br>
\page<br>

<br>
### --( Kasoku Saikassei - Accelerated Revitalization )--<br>
An advanced medical technique which temporarily allows the body to
sustain itself by accelerating the body's metabolism and chakra
reserves.&nbsp; It was originally developed to extend the medic's
usefulness in prolonged missions, but has been expanded
since.&nbsp; It is used sparingly because of how long it takes to
recover from, and how it tends to leave people comatose afterward.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X * 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: X * 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Flawless Diagnosis<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This lowers the recipient's effective Fatigue level by X, with X having
a maximum of their current Fatigue level.<br>
<br>
A person can only benefit from one application of this technique. To
apply it again, they must first release the previous instance of
it--which may, potentially, render them immediately unconscious, if
their &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; Fatigue level is 6 or higher.
Notably, an unconscious person cannot benefit from this technique.<br>
<br>
However, forcing one's body beyond its limits like this is costly. For
the next X weeks, the recipient will not recover from Fatigue at all,
even through the use of Soldier Pills (though another application of
this technique would still function). If multiple instances of Kasoku
Saikassei are delaying one's recovery, only the one with the longest
time remaining is counted for that purpose.<br>
<br>
This technique cannot be used offensively.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kizu Saishuu no Jutsu - Wound Sealing Technique )--<br>
This technique uses chakra to make repairs to an injured body; gashes
are pulled shut, wounds sutured, damaged organs held steady by the
application of chakra. This can give an injured shinobi&nbsp; the
second wind they need to win a battle or complete a mission.<br>
<br>
However, this is only a temporary measure; before long the chakra will
unravel. As such, this is considered an emergency technique among
medics, to be used only when there's no other choice. Most will
hesitate to apply this to their comrades, as far too many shinobi will
prove willing to, using this newfound health, charge into battle,
defeat their enemies, and then die hours later when their borrowed time
expires.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30, Delay 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Vital Repair Technique<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The recipient immediately regains up (25 + (your ninjutsu damage
bonus)*2)% of their maximum Vitality, which will not take them above
their maximum. However, (your ninjutsu damage bonus) hours later, their
wounds will reopen; they'll immediately take that much damage, +10%,
which cannot be reduced or mitigated. Until this occurs, they will not
heal normally (i.e. as described in the Recovery section of the Combat
chapter).<br>
<br>
This can be fatal.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Rinji Hougou no Jutsu - Temporary Suture Technique )<br>
Weaving a network of chakra, a medic can make short-term repairs to
damaged body parts. They can set wounds and hold them rigidly in place,
use chakra to take the place of damage muscles and tendons, alleviate
swelling and bruising, or even repair damaged blood vessels and do the
job of injured nerves.<br>
<br>
The problem with this is that it's a short-term fix to a long-term
problem. This is itself damaging, but beyond that it prevents the body
from doing anything to repair itself, and allows undue strain to be
placed on these injured body parts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + 3 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10 + 3 * X, Delay 5 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Tourniquet Technique<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This temporarily negates the effects of up to X wounds; it can be
applied later to negate additional wounds, without disrupting previous
applications.<br>
<br>
This lasts for (the medic's ninjutsu damage bonus) hours, after which
time the chakra sustaining the jutsu expires--and the recipient pays
the price for pushing their body beyond its limits.<br>
<br>
For each wound remedied this way, they take damage equal to 5% of their
maximum Vitality, per category of the wound. Thus, if this was used to
negate a Minor and a Severe wound, after it ended the person would take
(5 + 15) = 20% of their maximum Vitality in damage (which could carry
over to their HP), which cannot be reduced or mitigated.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the recovery times of these wounds is increases by 1 week
per level of the wound (1 week for minors, 3 for severes, etc.). In the
case of wounds whose penalties are reduced over time, this
&amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; recovery time must be made up for
first, before normal recovery can continue.<br>
<br>
This can be fatal. It cannot be used on an unwilling subject (though as
with its predecessor, Tourniquet Technique, you may use it on
yourself). So long as this technique is in place, natural healing (as
described in the Recovery section of the Combat chapter) will not take
place.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Meguri Seigyo no Jutsu - Hemostasis Technique )--<br>
Although this technique is fairly simple, it's not taught to amateur
medics due to the danger inherent in making any sort of mistake when
applying it. This temporarily adjusts the recipient's pulse and blood
flow, putting their body in a more stable condition. This is mainly
used to prevent someone from bleeding out, and to prevent the spread of
poison.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X * 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6 + X, Delay X / 2<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This lasts for X * 5 IC. During that time, the damage the recipient
takes from Bleed effects is reduced to 0, the Stamina penalties from
Bleed effects is not applied, and they take damage from Poison once
every 2 IC, rather than every IC. The severity of Bleed statuses is
reduced normally. During this time, they have a +5 bonus to all their
Resistance rolls.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Shousen no Jutsu - Mystical Palm Technique )--<br>
In many ways the pinnacle of medical ninjutsu, this allows the user to
dramatically accelerate the body's natural healing process by using
chakra to stimulate it. This lets them heal a patient without the need
for medical equipment, surgery, or even ordinary healing times. Despite
the incredible skill required in matching the distribution of chakra to
the severity of injuries, this looks incredibly simple: the medic
places their faintly-glowing palms on the recipient, and injuries begin
to vanish.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X / 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Abort<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Vital Repair<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
For the duration of this technique, you must keep your hands on its
recipient. If you are stunned, or knocked away, it is Aborted
automatically. The value of X is determined, and the Chakra cost paid,
after it ends. This paragraph should seem familiar.<br>
<br>
Every IC which passes, you heal 10 of the recipient's Vitality. This
will not heal lost Hit Points.<br>
<br>
You pay the cost of this technique after you finish healing, based on
its actual duration. If you Abort it, or are forced to, X is reduced
appropriately. A single person may benefit from this only once per day,
per medic.<br>
<br>
You may use this technique on yourself, as with Vital Repair.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fukugen Ryouhou - Rejuvenating Remedy )--<br>
An advanced technique in which, with a touch, the user sends a pulse of
chakra throughout the body of their target, which corrects disrupts in
the user's chakra flow and the nerves and blood vessels which they
follow throughout the body.&nbsp; It is widely rumored to have been
developed by a Hyuuga medic-nin.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This clears the person touched of immobilization and paralysis
penalties which are internal (Poison, clay bullet, etc. would not
apply, but notably, Combat Acupuncture and Nervous System Derangement
would).&nbsp; It immediately ends any stuns which are presently
affecting them.<br>
<br>
It is also strong enough to disrupt weaker Genjutsu, granting another
defensive roll against a single Genjutsu affecting them of C rank or
lower, with a +5 bonus.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Saikan Chuushutsu no Jutsu - Delicate Illness Extraction
Technique )--<br>
An delicate and advanced technique even among medical ninjutsu, this is
nonetheless exceptionally useful. The medic makes an incision on the
patient's body (usually the torso, but other locations are possible)
and then uses chakra to draw out any poisons, toxins, or other
pathogens that may be afflicting the person.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18, Delay 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Chakra Scalpel<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This immediately cures any poisons a person may be suffering from. Most
parasites and chemical toxins can also be excised this way. Despite its
name, however, it is not able to actually cure diseases or viruses.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kyouka Shohou: Chakura Chuunyuu - Strengthening Prescription:
Chakra Injection )--<br>
Originaly developed as a kinjutsu, the version used by medics today is
a safer (though still by no means safe) derivative. Using
medically-altered chakra, an individual can be greatly, if temporarily,
strengthened. Unfortunately, they are burning their proverbial candle
at both ends when under the effects of this technique.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25, Delay 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The recipient has their ninjutsu and physical damage bonuses increased
by one half of your ninjutsu damage bonus, and receives a bonus to
Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to your ninjutsu damage bonus.<br>
<br>
However, whenever they fail a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll, their
Fatigue is raised an additional category. Additionally, any time their
Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion penalty increases, the other is increased
by the same amount.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Ranshinshou - Nervous System Derangement )--<br>
Upon making contact with the enemy, the user converts their chakra into
actual electricity and sends it through the nervous system of the user.
This disrupts the signals that are sent to the brain from the various
limbs and muscles, making the wrong muscle flex or move when you try to
say..move your arm. In the end, you just flail on the ground.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 55<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25 <br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts a -12 Immobilization penalty that can only be reduced by
spending AP at a rate of 10 AP per -1, which may be done as a Speed 1
action. While this penalty is -10 or more, you cannot do anything
(Defend, Attack, Anything.). It cannot be reduced below -5 until after
100 IC have passed.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Chikatsu Saisei no Jutsu - Healing Resuscitation Regeneration
Technique )--<br>
The pinnacle of advanced medical jutsu, with effects that border upon
miraculous, this stimulates the body's stem cells to begin dividing and
recreating a lost or destroyed part of the body--such as a limb or
organ. In time, full functionality will be regained.<br>
<br>
Doing so, however, is incredibly difficult, even for experienced
medical nin. In the rare instance when this technique is performed,
multiple medics will usually work in tandem.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 200<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
A medic involved in this technique makes the Chakra roll, and then
spends 1 Willpower towards the regeneration process. A total of 100
Willpower must be spent this way, but the process cannot be completed
in less than 10 weeks;&nbsp; at least 1 Willpower must be spent
each week, or all progress is lost. After the last point of Willpower
is added, the user regains their lost limb, organ, or body part.<br>
<br>
During this time, the recipient cannot go above Fatigue 2. If they do,
at any point and for any reason, all progress is lost.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kyuushou Taisha - Vital Regeneration )--<br>
The medic-nin focuses their chakra on a specific part of the body and,
using what is left of the damaged organ or area, forces a rapid
replication of specific types of cells.&nbsp; It is capable of
mending broken bones and repairing ruptured organs with astonishing
speed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20 + 10 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 50, Delay 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Mystical Palm<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This completely cures one wound the recipient is suffering from. X is 1
per severity of the wound (1 for minor, 4 for critical). However, for
the next X * 4 weeks, the healed individual's Fatigue is considered 1
higher for all purposes; in the case of Critical wounds, their Fatigue
is considered 2 higher. Multiple uses of this stack.<br>
<br>
For example, say you had a Critical wound and a Major wound cured on
the same day. You would be perpetually at Fatigue 3 for the next 2 * 4
= 8 OOC days. After that, there would still be 8 more days (for a total
of 16, for the Critical wound) of being unable to go below Fatigue 2.
If you had another two Severe wounds healed this way in that time,
you'd be at Fatigue 4 until the after-effects started wearing off.<br>
<br>
Although most experienced medics know this technique, they are
typically reluctant to cure every individual who injures themselves in
training or on a mission. Most medics believe that even if the person
doesn't need to learn a lesson for their mistakes, it's better to heal
naturally (with a little bit of help when necessary) than to send a
weakened, but technically uninjured, ninja back into danger.<br>
\page<br>

<br>
### --( Mikiri Saisei - Forsaken Rebirth )--<br>
A powerful, but potentially dangerous, technique, this allows the medic
to transform a portion of their 'life energy' to another individual.
Originally, this had no limitatuons; a medic could easily kill
themselves&nbsp; bring an ally back from the brink of death, which
earned the technique its name. Over time, such extreme measures became
less necessary (medics capable of using it were, after all, generally
more valuable to the village than anyone they might be healing), and
the version of the technique taught to medical nin was altered to
prevent that.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20, Delay 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
After paying the chakra cost, you may 'spend' additional Fatigue levels
(though you may not render yourself unconscious by doing this) to
improve this technique's effects. In fact, without spending Fatigue
this way, it does nothing at all. You may not use this technique on
yourself.<br>
<br>
Each Fatigue level heals 20% of the recipient's HP and 10% of their
Vitality, and lowers their Fatigue level by by 1, in addition to
resetting their Chakra and Stamina penalties to 0.<br>
<br>
Each Fatigue level also allows them to ignore one wound they already
have of their choice for the next X in-character days, where X is the
total number of Fatigue spent. All their Minor wounds must be ignored
before this can move on to Major, and all their Major before they can
move on to Severe. This cannot be used to ignore Critical wounds.<br>

### --( Shikon no Jutsu - Dead Soul Technique )--<br>
You can reanimate a corpse for a limited amount of time, forcing its
heart to beat, organs to appear to function, and chakra to circulate,
through careful and precise application of your own chakra. Skilled
medical shinobi can completely erase any signs of injury to the corpse,
and remove the usual associated smell.<br>
<br>
This technique is not actually as difficult as it might seem. It's not
even a proper jutsu, just something it becomes very easy for a
sufficiently skilled medic to figure out on their own. However, even
shinobi have standards, and for most medics this crosses that line.<br>
<br>
Thus, while it's not strictly forbidden, there is a very strong stigma
attached to its use, especially within the medical community.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 40<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may target any human corpse which has died in the past (Medicine
skill ranks)/2 hours, as long as it has not suffered any Severe or
Critical wounds. This technique erases all signs of it being a dead
body, and any signs of injury the medic chooses (some may be left in
place, to make it more convincing).<br>
<br>
You can control this body by minute adjustments of chakra; you do not
need to move, only concentrate (and continue to pay the Upkeep), to do
so. Once this technique has been applied, the body begins deteriorating
rapidly; after (Medicine skill ranks)/3 hours it will be too badly
decayed to function. The jutsu will end, and it will appear to have
been dead for several days (it will be desiccated, but not decayed, as
microbes and vermin will not have actually been consuming it).<br>
<br>
Byakugan, Flawless Diagnosis, and similar effects can identify the
corpse for what it is. Sharingan can tell that the 'person' seems to be
using some sort of jutsu, possibly similar to Henge, but not identify
the technique itself.<br>
<br>
You can use these corpses to fight. On their own, they fight normally.
In combat with you, you may spend AP to make them act, costing 1 AP per
2 Speed of the action you want them to take. They may not use chakra,
though they may talk and perform other complex actions. When necessary,
you use your skill rolls in place of theirs. The corpse cannot heal or
be healed. It begins at Fatigue 0; if it reaches Fatigue 3, your jutsu
ends and the corpse becomes lifeless and unusable.<br>
<br>
Learning this technique results in a one-time gain of +15
Infamy.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
\page<br>
# Sealing Ninjutsu<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Kankin Kanshihon Fuuin - Confinement Scroll Seal )--<br>
This technique requires a blank scroll and something to write with. A
series of symbols are written on the scroll, various items are placed
on top of it, and the user performs the proper handseals. The items
will vanished, stored inside the seal until they're released. This can
be done repeatedly, with each item corresponding to a separate symbol
on the scroll. Items can be sealed and released all at once, or one at
a time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This stores up to 50 pounds of objects inside a scroll. Releasing any
number items is a Chakra 5, Speed 5 actions, which can be done by
anyone who knows this technique. If used to release a weapon, it takes
a separate action to 'draw' (grab and properly grasp) that weapon.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Soshoryu - Twin Rising Dragons )--<br>
This requires two storage scrolls with projectile weapons stored inside
of them. When this technique is used both the scrolls are launched into
the air (giving the technique its name). The user can then jump up
between them, grabbing and throwing various projectiles.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: Variable.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: As weapons used.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: Variable<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Two scrolls with thrown weapons sealed
inside them.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You unseal and throw weapons. This is a regular multi-throw, but you
add CHA/4 to your DEX when determining how many weapons you can throw.
Notably, this can't be done with Senbon.<br>
<br>
While Soshoryu itself is (obviously) a ninjutsu technique, the
multi-throw attack you perform as part of it is a ranged taijutsu
attack.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Sougu: Baku Ryuusei - Manipulated Tools: Attached Meteor )--<br>
Large, elongated sections of chains with weighted ends shoot out of a
scroll and are directed toward an opponent.&nbsp; They spiral
around and surround the victim before the slack is removed, binding the
opponent and restricting movement.&nbsp; It does minimal damage on
its own, but is useful as a setup for a more potent attack.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You make a Ranged Taijutsu Attack.&nbsp; If you hit, this deals no
damage but restrains the opponent, inflicting a -2 Immobilization
penalty, increased by 1 per point your Accuracy exceeds their defensive
roll, with a maximum of -7.&nbsp; Partial defense does not apply.<br>
<br>
The chains themselves are still attached to the scroll, and therefore
sufficient movement on the part of the victim will reduce this penalty,
lowering it by 1 per four yards moved.&nbsp; Alternately, they can
try to just wrestle free as a Speed 6 action, rolling 1d20+STR/5
against your 1d20+CHA/5+(the remaining immobilization penalty from
Attached Meteor).&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Shikoku Fuuin - Finger Engraving Seal )--<br>
Concentrating chakra into your fingertip, this allows you to 'write' on
any surface you please. On solid objects, this will cause a slight
depression on the surface and stain it black. On flesh, this will cause
slight discomfort and leave a scar, which is initially ink-black and
lightens over the next few weeks to regular scar tissue.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 1 per word<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 20 Chakra Control<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can write on any surface. With chakra!<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuukoku Houin - Dark Sealing Method )--<br>
A once-specialized technique that's been adapted to see broader use,
the Dark Sealing Method is used when a simple lock just isn't reliable
enough. The user takes several paper tags, writes the appropriate seals
on them in their own blood, and then applies them to the edge of the
doorframe, lid, or other appropriate edge of what's being sealed. After
that, the handseals are performed and chakra is applied.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The door or container the paper tags are placed upon cannot be opened
so long as this seal is in place; no amount of physical force can
overcome it. That said, it gives no special properties to what has been
sealed; if you apply Fuukoku Houin to a rickety wooden door, most
people would have minimal trouble breaking a hole in the center of that
door.<br>
<br>
The tags themselves are virtually indestructible until the technique
ends.<br>
<br>
When you apply this seal, you may specify a certain time for it to end,
such as &amp;quot;two days from now&amp;quot;. The seal will
last until the designated time arrives, or it's removed by some method
(such as the A-rank Five Elements Unseal). The person who placed this
seal can simply peel the tags away from the sealed surface, destroying
the seal in the process.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Sougu: Tensasai - Manipulated Tools: Heavenly Chain of
Destruction )--<br>
An advanced form of Twin Rising Dragons, the user throws a scroll into
the air and leaps after it.&nbsp; In midair the weapons inside the
scroll are released and projected by the user's chakra, allowing them
to guide far more weapons than they would be able to by hand.&nbsp;
It gets its name from the speed of its most proficient practitioners,
who can propel their weapons so fast they appear as rays of light.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: Variable, Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: As multi-throw.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Soshoryu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You perform a multi-throw technique using weapons stored inside one or
more scrolls. The Chakra cost is equal to whatever the Stamina cost
would normally be. Your ninjutsu damage bonus is used in place of your
physical damage bonus.<br>
<br>
You may target any number of people within range, each with separate
multi-throws. This has the same cost no matter how many people you
target, but you must use the full number of weapons (if you
&amp;quot;throw&amp;quot; 10 shurikens at 4 people, you'd need
40 shuriken total).<br>
<br>
Like Soshoryu, this may not be used with senbon; it may also not be
used to perform called shots.<br>
<br>
Alternately, by doubling the number of weapons you can make this an
Area 10 attack, in which case it hits everything indiscriminately; by
quadrupling the number of weapons required you can make it Area 20
centered on yourself, with you at the center. In either of these cases,
the severity of wounds inflicted is reduced by one (additional) rank.<br>
<br>
As an example of how that works: If you have 80 DEX, you could throw 16
shuriken to hit everyone in Area 10, with the equivalent of an
8-shuriken multi-throw. The increase in damage bonus based on number of
weapons thrown would be (8 * 0.5) = 4, not (16 * 0.5) = 8.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Netetsuki no Jutsu - Sleeping Moon Technique )--<br>
An exceptionally useful technique, as it approaches the
much-yearned-for concept of a &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; seal;
one that can be deactivated easily without requiring extensive time and
effort to then replace it.<br>
<br>
This is not actually a seal itself, but a large number of specific
modifications which can be applied to almost any advanced sealing
technique; less complicated sealing jutsu are too simple to incorporate
these alterations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: +15 + X * 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: +10 + X * 5<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is used to supplement another sealing technique of rank C or
higher. When you apply it, specify an activation condition and a
deactivation condition.<br>
<br>
Possible triggers include:<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; Someone passes within (up to
10) yards of it.<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; There is nobody within (up to
10) yards of it.<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; A certain word is said or
noise is made.<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; Someone touches the seal.<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &amp;gt; A specific person touches the
seal (see below).<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
If keyed to touch-activation or -deactivation by specific people, you
can specify up to X people, where X is (Research ranks)/5, who the seal
will recognize by chakra signature; all of those people must be present
when you apply the seal.<br>
<br>
When the activation condition occurs, the seal is activated. When the
deactivation condition occurs, the seal becomes dormant; none of its
effects apply until it's reactivated, though it remains visible.<br>
<br>
Removing the seal augmented by Sleeping Moon Technique also removes
this portion of the seal. Alternately, the Sleeping Moon seal could be
removed, leaving the original seal in place but uncontrollable.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Tsuiseki Fuuin - Tracking Seal )--<br>
A very useful seal, though one which suffers from a number of
limitations. When applied to a person, the seal vanishes almost
immediately, becoming invisible and virtually undetectable, even to
shinobi capable of seeing chakra (such as the Hyuuga and
Uchiha).&nbsp; Afterwards, whoever applied the seal will be able to
get a vague idea of the location of the sealed individual, allowing
them to be tracked across any distance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20, raised to 30 if it hits<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Used as an attack, you are allowed an Espionage roll with a +5 bonus
against the opponent's.&nbsp; If you succeed, they think you struck
a glancing blow with a close-range attack; if you fail, they realize
you used some sort of jutsu on them, though not what its effect was.<br>
<br>
Once applied, the seal is invisible and undetectable. It will only be
discovered by a sealing expert who knows to look for it. These seals
have been known to go undetected for years, as a result.<br>
<br>
You may only have one Tracking Seal applied at a time (though one
person can have multiple Tracking Seals placed on them); if you use it
on another person, your link to the other seal is broken, and that seal
unravels harmlessly.<br>
<br>
By forming a handseal and concentrating for several seconds you know
the direction and approximate distance from your current location of
the person you're tracking. This does not provide any bonuses in
combat; while it lets you know your target is nearby, it lacks enough
precision at such short distances to help you discover an opponent
hidden in stealth. There is no limit on how often you may activate a
Tracking Seal, though you have to stop and concentrate each time (and
so cannot do it while moving).&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## B-rank<br>
### --( Fuuka Houin - Fire Sealing Method )--<br>
This technique allows a ninja to seal fire into a scroll. The proper
seals must be written on the scroll, followed by the correct handseals.
Once the technique is complete the flames will vanish entirely and be
sealed within the scroll; the kanji for
&amp;quot;seal&amp;quot; will appear on said scroll.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This seals a fire inside of it. Up to (CHA/5) square yards of fire can
by sealed this way (based on the area of whatever's fueling the flame).
This works just as well with chakra-based flames as mundane ones.<br>
<br>
If you complete the seals for this technique on the same Initiative
Count that somebody finishes seals for a Katon jutsu, you may, as long
as that technique involves actual flames, make an opposed Chakra
Control roll against them, with a +10 bonus. If you meet or exceed the
result of their roll, you seal their jutsu with this technique.<br>
<br>
You can also use this technique to immediately end any Ignite effects
on all people within the area affected.<br>
<br>
Each use of this technique requires a blank scroll for the fire to be
sealed in. Once sealed, the flame is extinguished; it cannot be
released, and the scroll cannot be reused.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Raikou Kenka - Lightning Blade Creation )--<br>
A special ninja tool summoning technique, this allows weapons or other
ninja tools to be sealed with a single symbol in a scroll or, more
commonly, clothes. Touching this symbol and willing it active is all it
takes to summon these tools.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 45<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This seals up to (CHA /5) items in a seal, which is applied to the
target item.<br>
<br>
You may summon weapons sealed with this technique as a Speed 0 action.
In the case of melee weapons, this also replaces the regular action to
draw the weapon. For thrown weapons, the first time you use this
technique to unseal and then immediately attack with a thrown weapon it
counts as a surprise attack.<br>
<br>
Any weapon or item in Equipment may be stored in these seals, though
each seal may store only a single type of item (such as kunai,
wakizashi, or smoke bombs).<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Keiyaku Fuuin - Contract Seal )--<br>
Implemented on a summoner, this removes any control the summoner has
over their summoned creature, and in most cases will temporarily
nullify the contract altogether.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Any summoning contracts the victim possesses are considered null and
void until this seal is removed. In most cases, this will forcibly
de-summon anything they've already summoned. Defensive Summoning
techniques used against this automatically fail.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Tsuyome Fuuin - Strengthening Seal )--<br>
An advanced and demanding seal, this applies a resilient lattice of
chakra to enhance the physical integrity of walls, floors, ceilings,
and the like.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 40<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may be applied to any surface up to (CHA /10) square yards, and no
thicker than (CHA /10) inches. You may divide the area by any whole
number to multiply the thickness limitation by that much. For example,
you could make it (CHA /10)/2 square yards, and in exchange apply the
seal to a surface (CHA /10)*2 inches thick.<br>
<br>
The seal is visible, though only on the side it's applied to (so if
it's on the inside of a wall, you would not see it on the outside).
Similarly, it can only be removed from that side. It may only be
applied to a contiguous object: if you wanted to apply Strengthening
Seal to a boat, each plank would require a separate seal.<br>
<br>
The surface this seal is on is virtually indestructible. It gains
(user's CHA)*10 HP, and has a damage reduction of (user's CHA), which
cannot be bypassed or reduced.<br>
<br>
This seal can only be applied to flat surfaces, such as walls. The
blade of a weapon, just as an example, would not be a valid target.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shinsei Chinmoku Fuuin - Sacred Silence Seal )--<br>
Often used as a form of so-called 'loyalty seal', this has seen
moderate popularity among various clandestine and/or extremist
organizations within the ninja villages, as well as a means of helping
ensure that double agents don't turn into triple agents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 18<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you apply this seal to a person, specify a topic. This may be as
broad (&amp;quot;anything involving Sand village&amp;quot;) or
as narrow (&amp;quot;the new jutsu you saw me use&amp;quot;) as
you wish.<br>
<br>
The victim may not attempt to communicate about that topic in any way,
be it through speech, writing, or other methods. Intent is what matters
here; if they think they're giving information about the subject, they
are unable to.<br>
<br>
The same restrictions apply regarding this seal itself. That said, it's
not particularly inconspicuous. While the seal itself prevents the from
showing it off, it takes the form of a hexagram somewhere on their
torso, back, or tongue (in which case it can't be seen without the
person actually sticking their tongue out and someone checking for it)
and is easily identifiable by anyone with Seal Training.<br>
<br>
You may, when applying this seal, also specify one exception to its
restrictions. For example, you could say &amp;quot;other Leaf
nin&amp;quot;--in which case the person with this seal could talk
to other Leaf nin about the sealed topic, but nobody else.<br>
<br>
This seal trumps any genjutsu short of the Poison Truth Technique.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Moji Hyouki no Jutsu - Rune Inscribing Technique )--<br>
A tricky seal, this allows the user to mold the chakra necessary for
any ninjutsu technique they know and then 'freeze' it, holding it
primed but inactive inside of a seal. Once a trigger condition occurs,
the jutsu is released.<br>
<br>
Use of this technique to prepare explosive Katon techniques and leaving
them around as a practical joke is strongly discouraged.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25 + X/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30 + X<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you use Moji Hyouki, select another ninjutsu which you are able to
perform, specifying all its variable parameters at that time. You pay
Moji Hyouki's cost, and then that jutsu's cost.<br>
<br>
Moji Hyouki can be placed on any reasonably flat, solid surface that's
at least one foot across in each direction, such as a floor or a box.<br>
<br>
Once applied, the seal will either vanish (making a potentially
effective trap) or remain visible as an elaborate set of seals that can
be identified by anyone familiar wit the technique (as a warning of
sorts). Even if Moji Hyouki is identified, the technique&nbsp;
placed in it will not be.<br>
<br>
When the seal is placed, an activation condition is specified. The
three possible activation conditions are:<br>
- Someone comes within five feet of the seal.<br>
- Someone touches the seal.<br>
- If the seal is on a door or container, it may be set to activate when
said door or container is opened.<br>
<br>
When the seal activates, the jutsu in question will immediately take
effect. If this is an offensive technique it will be aimed at the
person who set it off (unless it's an AoE, in which case it will be
centered on the seal). Offensive techniques used this way have a -2
Accuracy penalty per rank of the technique.<br>
<br>
The A-rank Five Elements Unseal will not trigger a touch-activated Moji
Hyouki.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Tensha Fuuin - Transcription Seal )--<br>
A rarely-seen technique, this seals the necessary chakra patterns for a
specific jutsu inside a person, and keeps it perpetually ready within
this seal. When a certain condition is met the seal activated and the
technique is triggered.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 35<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When used, declare another technique which you know, pay its cost, and
specify a condition. The technique immediately and involuntarily
activates when that condition is met. <br>
<br>
Possible conditions include &amp;quot;when you see the
daimyo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;when you hear the word 'orange'
&amp;quot;. A target can be specified within reason (such as
&amp;quot;the daimyo&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;whoever said
that word&amp;quot;).<br>
<br>
The technique stored inside a Transciption Seal may not be a taijutsu
or medical ninjutsu technique, nor may it have a Stamina cost or
Upkeep. If it is a Genjutsu or Sealing technique, it is applied to the
person on who the Transcription Seal was placed. If it's anything else,
the Seal's recipient must pay the associated cost or costs.<br>
<br>
<br>
A person may only have one Transcription Seal on them at a time, per
person (three sealing experts could each place one Transcription Seal
on a single person, for example).<br>
<br>
This seal is invisible and undetectable except for by a fuuinjutsu
expert who knows to look for it.<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Gogyou Fuuin - Five Elements Seal )--<br>
This jutsu produces a powerful seal that disrupts the flow of chakra in
the target. In most cases this is crippling.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 50<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The unfortunate victim has a -25 penalty to all Chakra Exhaustion
rolls, and has their Chakra Control skill ranks reduced by 15, which
can also temporarily lower their ranks in abilities (such as Water
Walking). Any jutsu with Upkeeps they have activated end immediately
due to the disruption of their chakra.<br>
<br>
If they fail a Chakra Exhaustion roll, they fail to use the jutsu they
were trying to (but still advance a Fatigue category as normal).
Furthermore, even if they succeed they must pass a Chakra Control check
against the technique's Chakra cost or fail anyway.<br>

### --( Gogyou Kaiin - Five Elements Unseal )--<br>
The opposite of the Five Elements Seal, but of much broader utility,
this technique can remove any seal of equal or lesser strength.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This can target a single seal on an object or person. That seal is
removed.<br>
<br>
This affects any seals described in this section. This technique may be
able to remove seals not described in the PHB... or, it may not.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Fuuja Houin - Evil Sealing Method )--<br>
Not all seals can be removed easily. This circumvents that by
suppressing fuuinjutsu, or any sort of chakra-based markings, on a
person. The technique's greatest failing is its dependence upon the
recipient to provide some of the strength behind it, meaning they can
overcome its effects at will, making it useless for offensive
applications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This suppresses any seal in this section of the PHB, and many which are
not. While the seal won't be removed, it won't activate or have any of
its normal effects as long as the Evil Sealing Method remains in place.<br>
<br>
This technique is dependent upon the recipient's willpower. All a
person has to do is focus and the Evil Sealing Method will be disabled,
until they spend 1 Willpower to reactivate it.<br>
<br>
The technique's quite useful. Virtually any long-term chakra-based
effect (even ones that aren't actually fuuinjutsu) can be suppressed by
it. Even the effects and abilities of bloodlines can be sealed.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Tsute Fuuin - Influence Seal )--<br>
This seal was originally created and placed upon servants of the
Diamyo, ensuring those closest to them could not spy or sabotage the
feudal lords. Over time, shinobi adapted to suit their own needs, which
naturally meant that it found a usage in combat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14, +10 if it hits<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You use your Accuracy for an unarmed Taijutsu attack, and if you hit,
you roll opposed Espionage (Partial Defense does not apply). If you
succeed in your Espionage roll, the seal is placed without the target
knowing.<br>
<br>
As part of this technique, you may either make a basic unarmed taijutsu
attack or use the E-rank Grab technique (if you know it), at no
additional Speed or Stamina cost.<br>
<br>
<br>
The seal is inactive by default, but as a Speed 10, Chakra 10 + X
action, you can create a temporary form of paralysis which turns their
own Chakra against them, preventing them from taking any non-Interrupt
actions. They declare their intended action along with its Accuracy and
Speed, but roll a Chakra X*2. If they fail, they are not fatigued and
do not roll the Chakra or Stamina rolls associated with their action.
Their IC is not advanced by the action's Speed, but they suffer a Stun
5 which cannot be reduced or negated.<br>
<br>
When applying this seal, &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; has a maximum
value of your current bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls, including
Fatigue bonuses but ignoring any non-Upkeep penalties.<br>
<br>
<br>
Every time that a victim has previously had to roll against this seal's
effects, they gain a +3 to their Chakra Exhaustion roll to overcome its
effects. After they've succeeded against even one of these rolls, the
seal is forced into remission, and will not affect them any more; it
cannot be reapplied or reactivated for the rest of that fight.<br>
<br>
Once the seal is subdued, it is, as far as the victim can tell, gone
entirely, its effects having been broken. However, after 24 hours have
passed the seal can be reactivated by its user, per the normal rules.
An expert in sealing jutsu will be able to, if they know someone has
had this seal applied to them, find and remove it using the A-rank Five
Elements Unseal technique.<br>
\page<br>

<br>
### --( Ketsumei no Tsurugi - Sword of Blood Oath )--<br>
This seal creates what is essentially a modified version of the blood
pacts many shinobi form with summoned creatures. Rather than a powerful
and intelligent animal, however, this 'contract' is made with a favored
weapon.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 40<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can seal a single weapon with this technique. The weapon vanishes,
and the seal for this technique manifests somewhere of your choosing on
your body--usually the user's forearms.<br>
<br>
You can summon the sealed weapon as a Speed 0 action, already 'drawn'.
As a Speed 4 action, you may return it to the seal, in which case it
vanishes in a puff of smoke; you must actually have the weapon with you
to do this.<br>
<br>
If the weapon is broken, or taken more than a mile away from you, it
vanishes in a puff of smoke. In this case it will not be available for
summoning for one hour. However, it is, for most intents and purposes,
indestructible and impossible to lose in any permanent sense.<br>
<br>
You may only have one Sword of Blood Oath seal active on you at a time.
Removing your current seal causes the weapon to appear beside you, and
allows you to make a new one.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Nenshou Fuuin - Burning Seal )--<br>
A highly-specialized, highly-effective sealing technique used to
prevent an individual from handling weapons. Though it's applied as a
single seal, it appears on both the recipient's (or rather, victim's)
hands, clearly recognizable as some form of ninja sealing technique or
tattoo meant to emulate one. Whenever the recipient holds a weapon the
seals activate.<br>
<br>
As the lines of the seal begin glowing a dark, heated red, the victim's
skin will start to burn and smolder. Within seconds their flesh will
start to smoke as they're baked alive; if one is willful or
self-destructive enough to not drop the weapon they're holding, they'll
soon have their arms reduced into charred, blackened husks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 40<br>
<br>
The seal activates whenever someone holds a weapon. After 5 IC, a Minor
Energy Wound is inflicted to whichever arm they were holding the weapon
with; in the case of a two-handed weapon, this is both arms. Dropping
the weapon will end this technique's effects immediately.<br>
<br>
If they're currently suffering from a wound inflicted by the Burning
Seal, it instead inflicts a wound of one higher category on that arm:
Major, then Severe, then finally Critical.<br>
<br>
For example, if a shinobi drew a nodachi and decided to use it
one-handed (holding it in their right hand) starting on IC 12, on IC 17
they would suffer a Minor Energy wound to their right arm. If they then
began two-handing it, on IC 22 they would have a Minor on their left
arm and a Major (in addition to the existing Minor) on their right. On
IC 27 those would be Major and Severe; on IC 32, they would become
Severe and Critical; and finally, by IC 37 they would have a Critical
Energy wound on both arms. &lt;/text&gt;<br>

# Genjutsu<br>
<br>
1. Requirements<br>
2. Special Rules<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Requirements<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Genjutsu's not easy. In fact, genjutsu is really, really hard, even by
the standards of other ninja techniques. Taijutsu and ninjutsu are
both, after enough shinobi training, slightly intuitive; and, in the
case of the latter, every ninja has an elemental affinity they can rely
on to help them out even when they struggle overall.<br>
<br>
Not so with genjutsu. There is no such thing as an 'affinity' for it
(though some ninja who seem to have an easier time learning it are
occasionally described as such), and it takes a lot work to be able to
use it effectively.<br>
<br>
The requirements for using Genjutsu of a given rank are listed below.<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt;E: Genjutsu Training ability<br>
&lt;br&gt;D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Research, and 15 (Chakra
Control + Research)<br>
&lt;br&gt;C: 10 Chakra Control, 10 Research, and 25 (Chakra
Control + Research)<br>
&lt;br&gt;B: 20 Chakra Control, 20 Research, and 50 (Chakra
Control + Research)<br>
&lt;br&gt;A: 30 Chakra Control, 30 Research, and 70 (Chakra
Control + Research)<br>
<br>
Notably, Jounin rank also gives access to C-rank Genjutsu.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Special Rules<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Genjutsu relies upon confusing the senses, which is a powerful tool in
the arsenal of someone who relies on subterfuge... or even just a
shinobi needing an extra edge in combat.<br>
<br>
It's quite possible to realize one's under a genjutsu, but that doesn't
give any special ability to overcome its effects
(&amp;quot;disbelieving the illusion&amp;quot;, so to speak,
doesn't actually work). On the other hand, it's hard to fool someone
again and again with the same trick; each time a genjutsu is
successfully used against you in combat, you have a (cumulative) +5
bonus to defensive rolls against that specific jutsu for the rest of
the battle.<br>
<br>
There are three ways to break free from most genjutsu:<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; Genjutsu Kai, the D-rank Ninjutsu technique.<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; If you suffer a Wound of any severity, all
Genjutsu effects applied you end as your mind gets its act back
together. <br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; Many Genjutsu will have upkeeps, durations, or
the like. Details will exist in specific jutsu entries.<br>
<br>
By their nature, it's hard to realize that one is suffering from the
effects of a genjutsu technique. It's possible to be afflicted by a
genjutsu that you know and use frequently, with obvious 'tells', and
still mistake it for reality--such is the nature of delusions.
Mechanically, this means that if you fail a genjutsu roll by 5 points
or fewer, you realize that you've been afflicted by an illusionary
technique; any higher, and you have no reason to suspect that what
you're experiencing is anything but reality.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## E-rank<br>
### --( Senpuku no Jutsu - Concealment Technique )--<br>
This jutsu allows a ninja to conceal small (or sometimes not-so-small)
items on their person or in their grasp. This is a fantastic technique
for smuggling items or transporting them in secrecy, its utility
counteracted only by its vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This completely hides an object from casual observation. Against a
detailed search, it gives a +5 bonus to any rolls to keep it hidden,
and allows the obect to, essentially, hide in plain sight. You have to
keep contact with the object, or at least keep it close to you (say, in
a belt holster).<br>
<br>
It won't hide it if you're being patted down. If the object interacts
with the rest of the world (such as taking a swinging with a weapon, or
using a key to open a door) the concealment ends.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Genkoe - Hallucinatory Voices )--<br>
Despite its name, this technique isn't limited to voices, or even
auditory hallucinations. It has no effect at all until the victim
begins paying a bit too much attention to their surroundings, at which
point the technique begins playing tricks on their senses, causing them
to see movement at the corner of their vision and gentle sounds just
slightly too vague to place.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 7<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique inflicts a -2 penalty to Awareness rolls. It also halves
the bonus for consecutive actions spent searching (so if you Searched
three consecutive times with Genkoe applied to you, you'd have a +3,
rather than +6, bonus on your next roll).<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Mousou Enmu no Jutsu - Illusory Mist Technique )--<br>
Masquerading as a higher-ranked Suiton technique, this creates a light
bank of fog which has little effect beyond making the atmosphere a bit
chillier. An illusion is then laid on all those present (the user may
exclude allies if they wish), tricking them into believing the mist is
actually thick enough to be a hindrance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Centered on self<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 7<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Anyone who fails a genjutsu roll is placed a -4 visibility penalty.
More insidiously, so long as they remain within the mist they have a -2
penalty to all their defensive genjutsu rolls.<br>
<br>
People who pass their genjutsu roll still see the mist, but for what it
really is: too thin and wispy to actually be an
impediment.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## D-rank<br>
### --( Kasumi Juusha no Jutsu - Mist Servant Technique )--<br>
This jutsu creates clones that phase in and out of the ground as if
they were made of a blackish, oil-like liquid. When attacked, the
clones regenerate themselves. The clones can be controlled to make it
seem as if they're attacking. The user can then time their attacks with
those of the clones to remain concealed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This genjutsu creates dozens of illusions of the user. Anyone in combat
with them must 'defend' against this technique with a genjutsu roll.
The clones are harmless, and slow-moving, but may feign attacks
intermittently.<br>
<br>
When this is used, you are automatically placed in Stealth (as one of
the clones). You may attack from stealth normally, but in addition to
ranged attacks, you may make any basic weapon or unarmed attack without
breaking stealth. Each attack lowers your Stealth TN by 3, rather than
5. If you take a Hide or Improve Hiding action, this technique's
benefits end.<br>
<br>
Once you've been found, you cannot hide among these clones again; you'd
need to use the technique once more to do that. This is a clone
technique.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Oboro Bunshin no Jutsu - Haze Clone Technique )--<br>
This creates what appear to be ordinary bunshin, even responding and
vanishing when struck. However, each time one clone is destroyed
another takes its place, typically just out of sight of whoever
destroyed its predecessor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10, +2 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8, +1 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4, +2 per clone<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may create up to three clones. This function as normal clones, but
you are always 'hidden' among your clones (as per the 'Hide Among
Clones' action), even after you've been hit by an opponent.<br>
<br>
Taking an Observe action allows an opponent to make a genjutsu roll to
realize that this is an illusion, but cannot actually single you out
from your clones. Any time a clone used in this technique is destroyed,
another one appears to take its place and the Upkeep is increased by 1.<br>
<br>
No initial genjutsu roll is made; opponents are, by default, tricked
into believing these are normal clones. However, after the first time
they realize this technique for what it is (i.e. an illusion) in batle,
they'll also recognize all future uses of it in that same battle as
such.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing
Technique)--<br>
The user creates an illusion of spinning leaves around the victim,
after the leaves disappear, the illusion begins, showing the victim
something they'd rather never see, be it a loved one hurt, a monster of
their nightmares, or some other such thing. In most cases, it is easy
to identify that the image is fake, due to the unlikliness of it
occuring, but some images still leave a foul sensation in ones mind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Whatever image this subjects the victim to, the end result is they lose
a point of Willpower. After the first time in a day this is
(successfully) used on someone, the 'horror' begins to lose impact,
reducing its effects to Stun 10 and no Willpower loss. If this genjutsu
is broken (by the target being wounded, or somebody else using Kai on
them) the Stun will end prematurely, but the lost Willpower will not be
regained.<br>
<br>
If used on a target with 0 Willpower remaining, this technique's Stun
is doubled (to 40, or 20, depending on whether or not it's been used on
them previously in that battle).<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Magen: Jigoku Kouka no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Descending
Hell Technique)--<br>
This illusion causes any afflicted by it to see a massive fireball
forming above them which slowly descends. Most prudent shinobi will
waste time trying to escape its radius, while those who are more
reckless will take the 'attack' head-on, bracing themselves against a
blow that never actually comes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If someone was affected by the genjutsu, they have until 25 IC have
passed to leave this technique's area. If they don't, they suffer a
Stun 15. This genjutsu ended before the time is up will prevent the
stun; once they are stunned, the illusion is already over and so cannot
be 'broken' to end the stun prematurely.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shinkirou no Jutsu - Mirage Technique )--<br>
This creates an illusion that can fool a person's sight, hearing, or
smell--or, with more effort, two of those, or all three. These can be
dynamic (such as a flickering fire or a fluttering curtain), but they
can't actually interact with anything.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 2 (max)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
By default, this creates an illusion that only applies to one sense;
examples would be an illusion of a curtain flapping in a breeze, or the
sound of footsteps.<br>
<br>
By raising the chakra cost by 5, the illusion can apply to two senses,
such as a tiger that crouches and snarls. Raising the chakra cost by 10
(to a total of 20) allows the illusion to be convincing to all three,
such as a fire that flickers, crackles, and smells like burning wood.<br>
<br>
This technique's primary limitation is its scale. It can't do anything
much larger than a large piece of furniture or more complicated than
one person. Anyone who interacts with this is allowed an Awareness roll
against your Chakra Control to realize it's a fake, with your roll
receiving a +5 bonus.<br>
<br>
Some things can make this obviously fake, such as touching it or
standing at the 'source' of the noise and realizing there's nothing
there. You can control this illusion if you're in range; if not, you
can set it to be essentially a looping recording.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## C-rank<br>
### --( Nemuri - Sleep )--<br>
A genjutsu whose greatest limitation is that it requires physical
contact, the user places their hand on a target and sends them
immediately into a deep slumber. Very nice for infiltration without
raising a fuss.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: No handseals required.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This can't be used in combat. If you're able to touch the target and
succeed with a genjutsu roll, they immediately fall asleep (it's a good
idea to ease them to the ground, to avoid them, say, bashing their
shoulder on a rock and immediately waking themselves back up).<br>
<br>
Unless they're woken up (see the Sleep status for details), they'll be
asleep for at least four hours.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kyousanken no Jutsu - Iron Curtain Technique )--<br>
The user places themself under a harmless genjutsu, which itself serves
no purpose but makes it more difficult for other genjutsu to affect you
normally.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
So long as this technique's upkeep is maintained, you have a +4 bonus
to defensive genjutsu rolls. This genjutsu does not end when you're
wounded.<br>
<br>
You may declare Iron Curtain as an Interrupt when targeted with
genjutsu, following the normal rules for defensive interrupts and
giving you its bonus for that defensive genjutsu roll. Iron Curtain
does remain active (as if activated normally) after being used this way.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kori Shinchuu no Jutsu - Sly Mind Affect Technique )--<br>
This technique warps an opponent's senses and sets them walking in
circles, potentially for hours on end, by making it seem to them as if
they're walking straight towards their desired destination. Maps,
compasses, and paths will all be ineffective--the best someone
suffering from this technique can do is hold the hand of someone who's
not, or hope they realize that they've passed the same landmark ten
times.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique has no effect in combat, and does not end when the
victim is wounded. You may target multiple people with this technique,
costing 1 Willpower per additional person who is affected (this extra
cost isn't paid if they defend against it).<br>
<br>
Someone affected by this technique will find themselves continually
walking in circles if they try to travel any appreciable distance (half
a mile or more). This lasts for 1 hour per point you beat their
genjutsu roll by. Every hour, they're allowed a new genjutsu roll
against your original result, to see if they notice the effects
(although this will not break the technique on its own).<br>
<br>
Not even something like following a road will work--they'll wind up
wandering off it, the illusion convincing them they're still on the
&amp;quot;road.&amp;quot;<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Magen: Kokoni Arazu no Jutsu - Demon Illusion: False
Surroundings Technique )--<br>
This jutsu allows the user to change the surroundings around a person
subtley, usually used to delay, or force people to walk in circles,
unaware that they have stopped going the right way, even messing with
ones ability to track the direction they are headed, such as north from
south.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 17<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Best used out of combat (anyone who sees this being used will realize
it's an illusion), this casts an illusion over an area. This could be
making a door appear to be a solid wall, a sign have the wrong number
on it, or an intact bridge appear to be broken.<br>
<br>
When used, make a genjutsu roll with a +5 bonus. Anyone who encounters
your illusion makes a genjutsu roll; failure means they believe it's
real, success means they know it's an illusion. Actually getting rid of
it requires the use of Genjustu Kai, though the illusion won't affect
senses other than sight.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shunou Kaimetsu - Brain Destruction )--<br>
This jutsu convinces the victim that they've been grievously injured.
Although it causes no actual physical harm, it convinces their mind and
all their senses that they've suffered some manner of severe damage.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 26<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This inflicts a temporary wound on the victim. It's by default Minor,
raised to Major if you beat their genjutsu roll by 5 or more, and
Severe if you beat their roll by 10 or more. They interpret this
technique as whatever sort of attack or jutsu would be appropriate to
cause the injury they believe they're suffering from.<br>
<br>
They suffer all normal effects of this injury (and good luck trying to
convince them it's all in their head), aside from HP loss or
unconsciousness. It lasts until the genjutsu is broken. You choose the
damage type and wound location.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Sen'un no Jutsu - Fog of War Technique )--<br>
You trap a target in some manner of in-depth hallucination. They may
believe that you've run away and think they're giving pursuit, or be
convinced that they're locked in combat with you. This technique is
often a last-ditch resort to escape from a superior adversary, or
bypass someone when there's no time to deal with them in direct combat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25 + X * 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Using this technique costs 2 Willpower if it succeeds. It has a +X
bonus to your Genjutsu roll, up to a maximum of +5. If used
successfully, whoever its victim was is left trapped in some manner of
hallucination. <br>
<br>
The target is essentially removed from combat for this technique's
duration. Unfortunately, this technique is particularly fragile. If the
target senses danger (such as from an incoming jutsu, or planting
explosives around them) it'll break in time for them to try to avoid
it. It lasts for a maximum of 5 minutes per 1 point you beat their
genjutsu roll by.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

### --( Nemurihane - Sleep Feather )--<br>
An advanced version of Nemuri, this causes the subject to briefly see
illusory feathers drifting down around them before they succumb to
sleep. It's no more useful in combat, but it can actually be used at a
range, or from hiding.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This functions as the C-rank Nemuri, but may be used at up to the
listed range.<br>
<br>

### --( Magen: Nijuu Kokoni Arazu no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Double
False Surroundings Technique )--<br>
An advanced technique, this constructs one illusion on top of another.
When the outer layer is destroyed, the second will flawlessly take its
place and masquerade as reality. Confident that they've overcome the
deception, most shinobi will have an even harder time realizing that
they haven't done so at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 8 (4 after the first layer is removed)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: False Surroundings Technique<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
As the regular False Surroundings technique, but removing the second
illusion requires a second application of Genjutsu Kai, and your
genjutsu roll with it has a +10 bonus.<br>
<br>
This may also be used with Sly Mind Affect, by increasing this
technique's cost by 6 and removing its Upkeep, in which case the second
'layer' of the technique has no bonus, but must still be 'discovered'
after hours of wandering, as per the normal Sly Mind Affect genjutsu.
Used this way, it becomes a targeted (rather than Area) technique),
using Sly Mind Affect's normal range.<br>

### --( Magen: Jubaku Satsu - Demon Illusion: Tree Binding Death )--<br>
This genjutsu makes its unfortunate victim believe that a large tree
has suddenly grown behind them through the use of some manner of
ninjutsu, and pinned them against its trunk by exceptionally-strong,
chakra-animated branches.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 34<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Immobilize 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 22<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Every 20 IC which pass, the victim is allowed another genjutsu
defensive against your original roll, at a cumulative +1 penalty, to
realize that this is only an illusion. Effects which allow someone to
reduce immobilization penalties do not apply against this technique.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Jigyaku no Jutsu - Time Reversal Technique)--<br>
Used on willing recipitants, this jutsu puts the target in a trance
like state, and keeps them hypnotized, to uncover forgotten memories or
past events. Its often used to uncover important details that have been
missed or forgotten on missions, or to help shinobi make 100% accurate
reports on the most important of missions, rarely on unimportant
missions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 28<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This can only be used on helpless or willing recipients. It places the
subject into a trance-like state, similar to hypnosis. It causes them
to recall any suppressed memories, and can help remember details they
might otherwise have forgotten.<br>
<br>
Mechanically, this will unravel the effects of the A-rank Sennou Sousa
no Jutsu, and gives a +5 bonus to Research rolls made to remember
details about a previous experience (such as glancing around a room and
needing to recall its contents). It will also uncover any memories
suppressed due to trauma or similar causes.<br>
<br>
This can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending
on what it's being used for, how deeply buried the hidden memories are,
and how much information needs to be remembered. This technique may
only be used on a given person once per day.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Gosaru Tatari - Five Monkey Curse )--<br>
This technique interferes with the victim's ability to see, hear,
smell, taste, and feel pain. Admittedly, the last one's an undesirable
addition to the mix (in most circumstances), butthe technique makes up
for that with its all-around usefulness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 28<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This negates all ranks the victim has in Enhanced Hearing and Enhanced
Sight, and any abilities dependant upon them (such as Blind Fighting or
Genjutsu Awareness). They also suffer a -2 visibility penalty (which
stacks with any other visibility penalties they may have). On the other
hand, their reduced sensory perception allows them to ignore the
penalties of any Minor wounds they may be suffering from.<br>
\page<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Magen: Tetsuotome no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Iron Maiden
Technique )--<br>
Chains burst from the ground beneath the victim and wrap around their
legs, anchoring them in place, followed by two halves of an iron
maiden, either on each side of the victim or in front of and behind
them. The iron maiden slams shut with them in it, causing excruciating
pain and a slew of debilitating injuries.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 18<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This temporarily inflicts a Minor Piercing wound on every location of
the opponent's body (torso, abdomen, both arms, both legs, and Slashing
on the head). If the genjutsu roll beats their defense by 10 points or
more, this is upgraded to a Major Piercing wound on every location.
These wounds last for the duration of the illusion, though the full
Stun will remain even if it's broken early.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Sakki - Killing Intent )--<br>
A side-effect of learning how to control chakra is the ability to
sense, and exude, what shinobi refer to as killing intent. More
powerful shinobi can project it more strongly, and even send lesser
ninja running with just a glance.<br>
<br>
This genjutsu simulates an intense blast of paralyzingly strong killing
intent in an attempt to overwhelm its target.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 10 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You and your target must have line of sight with one another (and
neither can be suffering from a visibility penalty of -6 or greater). X
is the amount the victim failed their Genjutsu dodge roll by, and until
the stun has ended they suffer from Paralysis X/3. The stun is cut
short if the jutsu ends early.<br>
<br>
This technique doesn't require handseals.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
## A-rank<br>
### --( Nehan Shouja no Jutsu - Temple of Nirvana Technique )--<br>
The most powerful version of Nemuri, used for putting a large group of
people to sleep. Anybody within fifty meters of the user who fails
their Genjutsu dodge is put into a deep sleep. Nothing short of
extremely loud noises, being shaken awake, several hours passing, or
similar situations will wake them up, allowing victims to be bound,
moved, or completely ignored. This move is again, useless in combat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 150<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 50 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Anyone in the area who fails a genjutsu dodge falls asleep. Anyone with
less than half the user's total XP automatically fails their genjutsu
dodge unless they spend a point of Willpower to be allowed to actually
roll it (that roll does not gain the normal effects of benefitting from
Willpower being spent on it, unless they spend another point).<br>
<br>
And, once again, it's no good on targets who are engaged in combat.
Like Nemuri, victims will be asleep for several hours unless awoken.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Kokuangyo no Jutsu -&nbsp; Bringer-of-Darkness Technique )--<br>
This technique specifically targets the victim's eyesight, effectively
blinding them and allowing its user to attack with impunity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 36<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 26<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This applies a -10 visibility penalty to the victim. While it's in
effect, anyone can attempt to hide from them (even if the victim can
somehow reduce that penalty below -6).<br>
<br>
This technique does not automatically end when the victim is wounded.
Instead, it requires a successful use of Genjutsu Kai (with a -10
penalty) or a Major or greater wound to be inflicted upon the
technique's user.<br>
<br>
While in effect, this technique essentially negates any doujutsu the
victim may possess.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kiokure Keiren - Nervous Convulsions )--<br>
This technique partially hijacks the victim's nervous system, reacting
in response to anything they do and sending conflicting signals. It's
only truly effective in combat, where physical activity is the most
spontaneous, and even slightly reduced reaction time can prove fatal.
This tends to be exceptionally painful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 27<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Whenever you take an action while under this technique's effects, X is
that action's Speed. You suffer from a Paralyze (X)/4, which lasts for
(X)*2 IC, applied after your action is resolved.<br>
<br>
Every time this effect is activated, you roll another genjutsu defense
against the original result. Once you succeed, and are free from the
genjutsu, new Paralyze statuses stop triggering, but any existing ones
will remain for their full duration.<br>

### --( Sennou Sousa no Jutsu - Memory-Concealing Manipulative Sand
Technique )--<br>
This technique allows the user to alter or conceal the subject's
memories. While it's not permanent, the change can by either subtle
(believing they were incapacitated and left unconscious, rather than
incapacitated and then interrogated), or about as much so as a
sledgehammer (erasing the past two days of their memory).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may only be used on a helpless or willing subject.<br>
<br>
On a willing recipient, the technique is incredibly potent. It can
suppress virtually any amount of a person's memories, and can even be
used to alter existing memories or create wholly fabricated ones. One
popular way of using the technique is to implant false memories of a
person choosing to defect (and suppressing ones of them coming up with
this plan) and then using them as a double-agent, working alongside and
gathering intel from the enemy until the technique is undone at the
right moment for them to change back to their original allegiance.
Indeed, this jutsu is one of the more pragmatic reasons for most
villages not trusting missing nin defectors.<br>
<br>
On a helpless and unwilling target, the jutsu's efficacy is greatly
reduced. An opposed genjutsu roll is made, and
&amp;quot;X&amp;quot; is determined as the amount this
technique's user succeeded by. Up to X hours worth of memories, in the
past X days, can be erased. The greatest limitation is the user's
knowledge. &amp;quot;Your meeting with the daimyo&amp;quot;
could be targeted for erasure, but there's no way of knowing if the
target also received secret orders after that meeting.
&amp;quot;Finding us here&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;the past
few hours&amp;quot; are reasonably common uses.<br>
<br>
No matter how extreme this technique is, it can't alter one's
subconscious. You cannot forget abilities, jutsu, or your name. You
might forget a person you met, but they'd always be slightly familiar.<br>
<br>
Although a person could be afflicted with multiple instances of this
genjutsu, it can only be applied once per week. Genjutsu kai will not
remove this technique, nor will being wounded. When you apply this
technique, make a genjutsu roll. Anyone other than you attempting to
unravel it (such as with the B-rank Jigyaku no Jutsu) has to roll at
least that high when they attempt to do so, or they won't even notice
this technique's presence.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Dokushin no Jutsu - Poison Truth Technique )--<br>
This technique traps the victim in a state of dream-like hallucination.
In that state, the technique's user can try to pry information from
them, in the form of questions, which the subject will then
(coherently, and audibly) mumble the answer to.<br>
<br>
Unlike torture, this technique leaves no physical marks, and the
victims will not remember what information they revealed or managed to
kept secret. It often takes longer than torture to extract usable
information, but it's much more reliable because the subject can't lie.<br>
<br>
Multiple, especially consecutive, uses of this technique can leave a
victim traumatized without knowing why--indeed, even the users aren't
entirely sure what kind of hallucinations the victim experiences. While
it's not quite a forbidden technique, using it is considered extremely
morally ambiguous.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 50<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique may only be used on a helpless victim, and when used
immediately puts them to sleep. The genjutsu user must then focus for
the victim's maximum Willpower in hours.<br>
<br>
The interrogator asks a question up to twelve words long, and an
opposed genjutsu roll is made.<br>
<br>
If the interrogator succeeds, the subject must answer the question
truthfully and without obfuscation. (To the question, 'Where is the
scroll?', &amp;quot;In the castle&amp;quot; would not be a
legitimate answer, but &amp;quot;In my room in the
castle&amp;quot; would). The subject only has to answer the
question asked, not the question intended.<br>
<br>
If the interrogator fails, the subject does not have to answer that
question. Alternately, they may spend a point of Willpower and
automatically succeed against a given question.<br>
<br>
Each time a question is asked, the subject gets a +2 bonus on future
genjutsu rolls against this technique, unless they spent a point of
Willpower to automatically avoid answering. So long as this bonus
lasts, the following questions cannot be asked:<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; Any question that they've previously been asked
during that session.<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; A rewording of a previous question
(&amp;quot;Who was that person?&amp;quot; instead of
&amp;quot;Who was that man?&amp;quot;, for example)<br>
<br>
If the victim does not know the answer to a question, that question is
simply wasted. The cumulative bonus to defend against this technique
lasts for the victim's maximum Willpower in days. A person won't begin
to regain Willpower (spent defending against this technique, or for any
other reason) until at least 24 hours have passed without Dokushin no
Jutsu being used upon them.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

### Konohagakure no Sato<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp;

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Located in the middle of Fire Country. Konoha experiences the full
gamut of desirable weather - that is to say, it's usually sunny, and
even the rainy days can be pleasant. The village is roughly one third
smaller than it was before the war, but strolling down the streets of
Konoha you might never realize unless someone told you. <br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
Konoha does not appear to have been damaged by the war at all. The
unwavering Will of Fire blazed in the hearts of the survivors and they
set about rebuilding and landscaping the damaged parts of the village
almost immediately. Narrow brick pathways sprawl from the outer edges
of the village, shaded by decades old oak trees, leading to small
housing communities tucked neatly into the forest. The village is more
a part of the forest now than it had ever been in the past. Many
buildings in downtown Konoha received new facades or were rebuilt
completely. Beyond this, the village isn't looking to waste resources
on overextending its boundaries. They make room for new citizens as
it's required. In the mean time, all the spaces reserved for future
expansion are filled with neatly kept parks and forested areas. <br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The forces of konoha have the clans of Aburame, Akimichi, Inuzuka,
Hyuuga, Nara, Senju, Uchiha, and the Yamanaka to call upon. <br>
```<br>
```<br>
After the Fourth Great Shinobi war, Konoha was no longer the most
densely populated village. They had the largest population of civilians
and shinobi before the war - and in honor of all those lost they built
a second monument in the east. As tradition in Konoha goes, they'll
never forget those who gave their lives for their village, but they
won't let the past keep them from building the brightest future they
can. Even a century after the war, the Will of Fire burns more brightly
now than it had ever in the past. <br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Unfortunately all of this good will does not pay the bills. Because
Konoha had the most to lose, it lost the most. They're steadily
rebuilding, and each generation of shinobi seems more bright and
promising than the last<br>

<br>
## Aburame<br>
The Aburame are one of four noble clans of Konoagakure, a quiet clan
whose members usually keep to themselves.&nbsp; They are fairly
distinct in the way they dress themselves, usually covering the
majority of their body with their clothing, with dark glasses that hide
their eyes.&nbsp; They are soft-spoken, often preferring only to
speak when they have something worthwhile to say.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Their solitude may have to do with the way their clan's techniques, as
every clan member at a young age becomes host to a hive of insects
called Kikaichuu, a special type of beetle-like bug which can actually
eat the chakra of their enemies in battle.&nbsp; Their bodies
become the nest of the bugs, and over time they form a symbiotic
relationship that allows the Aburame to mentally control and direct
them.&nbsp; While a powerful kekkai genkai, it is not an ability
that interests most people.<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
<br>
##### --( Kikaichuu no Jutsu - Parasitic Destruction Insect Technique
)--<br>
A technique exclusive to the Aburame, wherein they allow their bodies
to be used as a hive for the insect.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Base Cost: 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scale: 5<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit: 4+EXP/400<br>
<br>
Effects:&nbsp; You gain a Swarm that starts out at Swarm Size 1 the
first time this is taken, and gains 1 Swarm Size every rank
thereafter.&nbsp; Every even rank of this ability (2, 4, etc), you
gain one Female Kikai. This swarm is inside your body and must be
deployed (See Kikaichuu node) to be used. In clan techniques, the X is
the amount of your swarm deployed. (If you have A Size 10 Swarm, you
could deploy 4 of it and gain bonuses for only 4, while keeping the
remainder safe inside your body.)<br>
<br>

##### --( Hijutsu: Mushiyose - Secret Technique: Insect Bite )--<br>

&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>

&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Xd20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: X/2<br>
<br>
This technique has an accuracy bonus of X/3, and if you hit, the target
takes a penalty to Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to the number of
Female Kikai in the Swarm, which is cumulative, but does go away when
they advance a Fatigue level, or do anything else that clears CE
penalties.<br>

&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA*5<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can actually send them further than the range of the technique, but
you can no longer communicate with them and can only send them to
places you know, and can only give them a single, basic command
(&amp;quot;Go home and find Ino&amp;quot; would be fine, but
&amp;quot;Search the town for anything suspicious&amp;quot;
would not).&nbsp; They will complete it to the best of their
ability and then return to you, but for every day in which they are
beyond the listed range, its Swarm Size is reduced by one.<br>
<br>

<br>
##### --( Hijutsu: Mushiyose - Secret Technique: Insect Gathering )--<br>
By touching the ground and sending their chakra out in a web-like
pattern, they can attract the attention of nearby insects to follow the
chakra signal and come to the aburame.&nbsp; Since they can
communicate with them, it can be a handy way to gain some basic
information about an area.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra:&nbsp; X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: X*5<br>
<br>
Effects:&nbsp; Any insects within X*5 yards are drawn to you, which
you can then gather information from.&nbsp; Most insects are
generally only concerned with very primitive things (eating, survival,
and reproduction), and therefore are limited in what they may know, but
will communicate what they can.&nbsp; Keep in mind this is not a
capacity to *talk* to insects, merely communicate with them.<br>

##### --( Fujin Kikaichuu - Female Destruction Bugs )--<br>
Every Aburame has female bugs, but not every Aburame can use them in
combat. Naturally, female bugs are treated like queens and never leave
the Aburame's body. Some Aburame, however, have learned to deploy
female Kikaichuu as mobile relays that entice and command their
kikaichuu more effectively.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Variable<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The range of this technique is based upon the size of the swarm you're
using and the action it's used alongside.&nbsp; It can be added to
an attack or a defense action.&nbsp; If the action is successful,
you also implant on the target a Female Kikai.<br>
<br>
They get an Awareness Roll versus the normal Stealth roll for Kikai
hiding when it's attached, but thereafter the female Kikai is
considered to be in Stealth 3, and they typically have no reason to
suspect its presence.&nbsp; It is a Speed 2 action for someone to
crush a female kikai that they've found on themselves.<br>
<br>
For as long as the Female Kikai is attached, the Aburame has a +5
Awareness bonus against the person it's attached to, Insect Bite has
it's Accuracy bonus increased to X/2,&nbsp; and they're always
considered to be 1 Stealth level lower than they really are.&nbsp;
If this would mean that they are not Stealthed at all, the Aburame can
attack them with ranged attacks as normal, but can not attack with
melee attacks (or have their clone do so).<br>
<br>
You can only attach a single Female Kikai to one person (attaching more
gives no added benefit), but can deploy as many Female Kikai as you
have.&nbsp; Deploying Female Kikai does not reduce the level of
your Swarm Size, but it does limit how many Swarm Size you can recover
via Insect Cocoon.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
##### --( Mushi Bunshin - Bug Clone )--<br>
Using thousands of Kikai, the aburame creates a replica of themselves
made out of their bugs.&nbsp; While it isn't capable of taking
damage well, the clone can actually use the abuame's chakra and thereby
use jutsu, making it a powerful tool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Swarm Size: X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: 1 Willpower, 1 Female Kikai<br>
<br>
Effects: &nbsp;<br>
You create a clone of yourself, dedicating one or more ranks of your
Swarm Size to the clone. It counts as having your HP and defenses (For
purposes of wounding) but you only have to deal wounds enough to reduce
it's Swarm Size to 0. (Via normal Kikaichuu rules)<br>
<br>
Once the Swarm Size used to make the clone is reduced to 0, the clone
is destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can voluntarily dismiss the clone
(As a Speed X action) to turn the clone back into a regular Swarm, but
not the Willpower.&nbsp; The Swarm Size used to create this clone
reduces your current and maximum Swarm Size (you can't 'replace' the
swarm size for this jutsu with Insect Cocoon).<br>
<br>
The clone can perform any jutsu you know, but has no chakra of its own,
using your chakra/stamina for anything it does.&nbsp; It acts only
when you spend AP for it to do so, and it can't act again until an IC
has passed equal to the speed of its action.&nbsp; You may hide
amongst your clones (and others may Observe them) as normal, but if
they do or react in a way that makes it obvious they're bugs (such as
taking less damage from a Taijutsu attack, or being immune to grapples
or various status effects), it is obvious that they're a clone.<br>
<br>
When Bug Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be Held
Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold
Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for
dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by
one category.<br>
<br>
[1 AP] Dodge or Parry (at their normal speed, which can be lowered by
AP as normal).<br>
<br>
[Variable AP]&nbsp; The clone may make any basic unarmed or weapon
attack, paying 1 AP per X speed of that action.<br>
<br>
[Variable AP]&nbsp; The clone can perform any jutsu you know,
paying 1 AP per X speed of that action.&nbsp; It uses your DEX to
determine Seal Speeds, which have to be paid for by AP as well.<br>

##### --( Mushi Jamingu no Jutsu - Bug Jamming Technique )--<br>
The abuame uses a large amount of their insects to cover a wide area of
the battlefield, and then transmits their chakra to the insects, which
cover the field in it.&nbsp; Depending on the whims of the Aburame,
they can produce a wide variety of effects.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: X*3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: X Swarm Size<br>
<br>
Effects: &nbsp;<br>
You create a cloud of Kikai that can be used to do one of several
things.&nbsp; You pick one from the list below when the jutsu is
used, and can switch between them as a Speed 10 action without repaying
the cost, so long as the upkeep is still being maintained.<br>
<br>
The Swarm used for this technique can not be used to do other things
(attack, defend, create clones) until the technique is
dismissed.&nbsp; You are immune to the penalties of this technique,
but can benefit from its effects (when using Disrupt Chakra Sensors,
namely).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Disrupt Chakra Sensors - While maintaining this
field, you take no penalty for the upkeep of your Kikaichuu (or this
technique) when someone tries to sense you, and instead have a bonus to
your Chakra Control roll of X*2 to disguise yourself from Scanning
attempts.&nbsp; Chakra Sensors/Chakra Sensitive people are not able
to sense anyone within the field when someone advantages a fatigue
level, or when they make a Chakra Exhaustion roll.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Obstruct Vision - By constantly keeping in
motion and following a synchronized pattern, the beetles can obstruct
anyone's vision who is within the field.&nbsp; While not an actual
hindrance to movement, they impose a -X Visibility Penalty to anyone
inside of it, or anyone attacking into the field, for as long as it's
maintained.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra Drain - Anyone inside of the field who
attempts do anything requiring a Chakra roll while within the field
takes a penalty to their roll equal to X/2, which persists until they
leave the field.&nbsp; Unlike normal penalties to Chakra Exhaustion
roll, it does not go away when you advance a Fatigue
level.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
You start with 1 Swarm Size when you first buy Parasitic Destruction
Insect Technique and get 1 more for each rank in it. These points
reflect the maximum size your swarm can be at any given time. You can
deploy all of it at once, or keep some of it safe while you use a bit
of it. If you lose points in your swarm, they regenerate at a rate of 1
per 3 OOC hours. If you let all your females die, this rate is doubled.<br>
<br>
When your swarm is deployed it has one Female Kikai with it for every 2
Swarm Size the swarm is strong, and one dies every time it goes down 2
Swarm Size.&nbsp; For every additional Female Kikai you have in the
swarm past the first you gain +1 strike with your Clan Techniques.<br>
<br>
Below are all the ways in which you can use your Swarm.&nbsp; In
all cases, X equal to or less than your Swarm Size. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Deploy (Speed X) - This creates a cloud of
Kikaichuu around you that extends X yard(s) out from you.&nbsp; You
gain an upkeep equal to X. While deployed, any time the Aburame is hit
by an area attack, the swarm loses 1 point, plus an additional point
per level of wound the Aburame took. (+1 for Minor, +2 for Major, etc.)
Every time the Aburame is inflicted damage by 5 IC of Ignite it also
causes the swarm to lose 1 point. If the Swarm Size is above 10, the
amount of points your swarm loses is doubled.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Return (Speed X/2 or +X/2, Interrupt) - An
aburame may recall their Kikaichuu as an Interrupt to have them return
to their body as they dodge.&nbsp; A successful dodge means they
return without being hit; a failed dodge means they are hit and
damaged, but return thereafter. <br>
\page<br>
<br>
## Akimichi<br>
One of the four noble clans of Leaf, the Akimichi do not come off as
particularly detached from, or superior to, others--none of the noble
clans do (well, perhaps the Hyuuga), but the Akimichi in particular
are, at least as a general rule, gregarious and altruistic.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The typical Akimichi is of below-average height and stockily built.
Some are overweight, others husky or muscular. This is partly genetics,
and partly the result of the unique jutsu they possess, which allow
them to manipulate their physical structure and rapidly convert
calories directly into chakra.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
A tradition within the Akimichi clan, though by no means an enforced
one, is for the shinobi members to place some manner of design on their
cheeks in facepaint, chosen after they become genin. Some change it
upon rising in ranks, while others go the opposite direction and opt to
get it tattooed on. Common examples are spirals, triangle designs, and
concentric circles.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Since before Konoha was found the Akimichi, Nara, and Yamanaka clans
have collaborated closely with one another, and most Akimichi will
unreservedly let their loyalty to their compatriots be known.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### Akimichi begin with 1 less Unique Point.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Calorie Control ]=-<br>
<br>
#### --( Calorie Conversion )--<br>
Akimichi can convert excess calories to chakra. This can be used for
just about anything that requires chakra, though it's most efficient
when combined with their clan's techniques. Overuse of this ability
results in them literally eating away at their own body; once all the
fat stores have been used, muscles and organ tissue is converted next.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limit: RES / 10<br>
Effects:<br>
Each time you take of this ability you gain five Calorie Points (CP).
CP can be spent to lower the Chakra cost of any Akimichi clan jutsu at
a 1:1 ratio, to a minimum of 0. You can spend them to reduce the cost
of any other jutsu at a 3:1 ratio, but not below half that technique's
normal cost.<br>
<br>
Alternately, you can spend CP to lower your Chakra Exhaustion or
Stamina penalty. It takes 2 Calorie Points to lower either penalty by
1. Finally, you can spend 50 CP to not advanced a Fatigue category when
failing a Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina roll.<br>
<br>
In dire circumstances, you may spend HP in place of CP. This may only
be done once you have 0 CP remaining. Every 2 HP spent takes the place
of 1 CP.<br>
<br>
You recover RES/5 calories per day, or half that amount if you can't
eat at least two full meals. You can choose to stop at your maximum (5
per rank) or go up to double that value (with 4 ranks, you'd have a
normal maximum of 20, and a true maximum of 40). Every ten CP you are
over your normal max (round up) incurs a -1 penalty to Accuracy with
Taijutsu, dodge rolls, Athletics rolls, and any other rolls which
depend upon mobility. Any time you move (as a move action, or part of
another action) the total distance you travel is reduced by a number of
yards equal to that penalty.<br>
<br>
Do note that as you use calories in battle, that penalty will go away.<br>
<br>

#### --( Akimichi Energy Bars )--<br>
Tasty, individually-wrapped energy bars which come in dozens of
flavors, including peanut butter, chocolate chip, blackberry, celery,
and milk. They're packed full of calories and simple-carbohydrates, and
Akimichi are able to metabolize them almost instantly.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Item<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 20 Ryo each<br>
Effects:<br>
Eating a bar is a Speed 4 action that restores 5+(RES)/20 Calories. You
may only eat up to (RES)/20 energy bars in an eight-hour period; any
more, and you're too full to keep eating.<br>
<br>
You may eat more than one energy bar at once, by adding 2 to the Speed
of the action per energy bar beyond the first.<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
<br>
##### --( Baika no Jutsu - Multi-Size Technique )--<br>
The primary jutsu of the Akimichi clan, this increases the user's body
size drastically; due to the extreme amounts of chakra necessary to
cause such drastic growth, it's usually powered by the clan's calorie
control techniques.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + X/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
Effects:<br>
You subtract X points from your AGI, and add X to your STR and RES. The
maximum value for X is 10 + XP/100. You can't reduce your AGI below
half its maximum value using this technique.<br>
<br>
##### The following effects apply during Baika no Jutsu:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Your physical damage bonus' divisor is reduced
by X/10, to a minimum of STR/12.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; You ignore any immobilization
penalties of X/5 or less; higher penalties are not reduced.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; All your unarmed attacks gain Area X/10, or have
their existing Area increased by that amount.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You gain a damage reduction of X.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; You have a -5 penalty to Stealth rolls.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You reduce the severity of any Stuns inflicted
upon you by X/10, and any effects which would move you involuntarily
will move you X/5 fewer yards.<br>
<br>
Once this has been used in a battle, you may alter the value of X as a
Speed 5 action without paying the cost. You may not take X higher than
the original value you paid for. For example, Chouji has 1200 XP and
uses Baika no Jutsu; X could be any number from 1 to (10+1200/100) =
22. If he uses Baika no Jutsu as a Chakra 25 (X = 20) action, he could
then take a Speed 5 action to set the value of his attribute changes
anywhere from +/-1 to +/-20, but to go any higher he'd have to pay for
Baika no Jutsu again.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Nikudan Sensha - Human Bullet Tank )--<br>
After enlarging with the multi-size technique, the Akimichi tucks their
limbs in and uses chakra to propel themselves in a powerful roll across
the ground.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25 to begin, 15 per attack<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/10)d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu
active<br>
Effects:<br>
While maintaining this technique, you are considered to be rolling.
While rolling you automatically block any attacks against you, unless
you choose to dodge; you cannot parry or perform handseals, and have a
-5 Awareness penalty.<br>
<br>
If you deal damage with this technique its Speed is reduced to 5
(though remains 15 for the purpose of dealing damage). You may attack
them again as a Speed 5 action, though may not reduce its Speed with AP
(and in this case, it does count as Speed 5 to determine damage).<br>
<br>
After you've missed someone, you cannot target that same person for 25
IC, as it takes time for you to turn and hit them again. <br>
<br>
While you maintain Nikudan Sensha's Upkeep, you move 25% faster and
halve any Immobilization penalties on you (after determining whether or
not they're ignored by Baika/Cho Baika). You cannot be physically
parried by anyone who has less than 75% of your modified STR.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Bubun Baika no Jutsu - Partial Multi-Size Technique )--<br>
A more situational variation upon the multi-size technique, this
temporarily enlarges only a single part of the body. Most commonly the
arms are chosen, for the sake of a quick offense, but legs are equally
viable.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5 + X/3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +2<br>
Effects:<br>
This supplements another action (typically a taijutsu attack). For the
duration of that action you gain +X STR, to a maximum of double your
normal STR. You also gain up to X/10 of the effects from Baika no
Jutsu's list. You cannot use this while Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no
Jutsu are active.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Nikudan Hari Sensha - Spiked Human Bullet Tank )--<br>
The Akimichi attaches dozens of kunai to multiple lengths of wire which
they then drape loosely around their body. When they increase in size
the wires become taut, and the kunai form rings of spikes around their
body. While this is certainly effective as a means of attack, the real
purpose is much simpler: the kunai function like cleats, aiding in
turning.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30 to begin, 20 per attack<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/8)d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu
active<br>
Effects:<br>
This functions the same as Nikudan Sensha, but is blocked as if it were
a weapon attack. Anyone who makes physical contact with you or comes
within melee range (including most weapon attacks) takes half this
technique's damage (based on Speed 15). This does not apply to people
who you attack (as they already take damage, from being attacked).<br>
<br>
Every consecutive attack against the same person, without you missing,
does 10% more damage. Turning after missing a target takes only 10 IC,
rather than 15.<br>
<br>
Using Nikudan Hari Sensha requires at least 30 specially prepared
kunai, which may be used repeatedly in this technique. Repurposing them
as regular throwing weapons (i.e. removing them from their wire) does
mean they can no longer be used for this.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Cho Harite - Mega Palm Thrust )--<br>
The user, already enlarged, pours still more chakra into their palms,
causing them to increase drastically in size. Surging with enough
chakra for it to be physically visible, the Akimichi's palms are as
strong as iron.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu
active<br>
Effects:<br>
This increases the Area of a taijutsu attack it's used alongside with
(though not ones which specify they are only kicks, and not Akimichi
clan jutsu) by X, and your damage bonus by X/5. X has a maximum value
of CHA/20 in Baika no Jutsu, and CHA/10 in Chou Baika no Jutsu.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Cho Baika no Jutsu - Super Multi-Size Technique )--<br>
Essentially a scaled-up version of the Akimichi's regular multi-size
technique, this increases the user (and their clothing) to gigantic
proportions; even the weakest users will be as tall as a building, and
with enough energy invested this can let someone easily tower over most
trees.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5 + X/4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
Effects:<br>
If used when already in Baika no Jutsu, this temporarily replaces that
technique's effects, and Cho Baika's cost is reduced by half the X
value used in Baika no Jutsu. Its Speed is reduced to 10.<br>
<br>
Your AGI is reduced by X*1.5, and your STR and RES are increased by
X*2. X may not be more than half your maximum AGI, and may not be less
than one quarter your maximum AGI.<br>
<br>
When active, the following effects are applied:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Your physical damage bonus is calculated as
STR/12.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; You ignore immobilization penalties of
X/5 or less.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; All your unarmed attacks gain Area X/5, or have
their existing Area increased by that amount.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You gain a damage reduction of X*1.25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You cannot hide.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You may choose to automatically block any
incoming attacks.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Your movement speed is calculated without
including the penalty from Cho Baika no Jutsu.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You can grapple someone using only a single
hand. This does allow you to, potentially, hold one person in each hand.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You reduce the severity of any Stuns inflicted
upon you by X/8, and any effects which would move you involuntarily
will move you X/4 fewer yards.<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Chodan Bakugeki - Butterfly Bullet Bombing )--<br>
This technique is typically only usable after an Akimichi has consumed
a red food pill, due to its extreme chakra requirements; in fact,
that's where it got its name. The amount of chakra produced from
consuming a red pill is so excessive that the Akimichi's body has to
vent it off, resulting in visible plumes of chakra bursting from their
shoulderblades in a display reminiscent of butterfly wings.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 250<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/5)d20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: Physical damage bonus *2<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This adds your physical and ninjutsu damage bonuses together to
determine its damage bonus. The primary target takes full damage;
anyone else caught in the area takes only the damage from your damage
bonuses.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Sanshoku no Gan'yaku - Three-Colored Pills ]=-<br>
A secret medicine developed and used exclusively by the Akimichi clan,
these three pills converts stored energy into chakra to give the user a
tremendous boost in power. Understandably, these are exceptionally
potent in the hands of an Akimichi.<br>
<br>
Even so, there's a good reason they're not widely used. They're not
gentle on the body, and the chemicals released by the pills in the
process are actually toxic. Eating a pill is a Speed 4 action.<br>
<br>
Despite their names, they don't taste like food. They taste like...
well, poison.<br>
<br>
All pills have some effects in common. When you use a pill, you will
gain some amount of Calorie Points. This is based on your true maximum
(10 per rank of Calorie Conversion), and can take you above it. While
under the effects of pills, you suffer no penalties from having too
many CP. When a pill's effects end, you lose CP equal to however many
it gave you.<br>
<br>
Anyone other than an Akimichi who takes these pills suffers half the
base Poison for half the base duration, and receives none of the
benefits.<br>
<br>
When a pill's effects expire, you can let it end or take a
higher-strength pill as a non-action. So long as you are under the
effects of one of the three pills, you ignore all penalties caused by
these pills. If you use one while another is in effects (for example,
you take the Green pill, and 20 IC later you take the Yellow pill) you
overwrite all the effects (including the Poison) of the lower-strength
pill, but keep any extra calories you have from it.<br>
<br>
Akimichi are issued only one of each pill at a time. Giving these pills
away is treason, and it's a credit to the clan that to date no Akimichi
has done so.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --(Hourengan - Green Spinach Pill )--<br>
You gain half your maximum Calorie Points. The ratios for spending CP
improve, becoming 1:2 for Akimichi clan jutsu, 2:1 for non-clan jutsu,
and 1:1 to reduce your Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina penalty.<br>
<br>
For the duration you are immune to knockback and have all your
attributes increased by 10%. When you take the pill, your Chakra
Exhaustion penalty is reset to 0. When this ends, your Fatigue is
increased by 2 categories.<br>
&nbsp; Duration: 50 + RES/5<br>
&nbsp; Poison: 3 - (RES/50)<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
##### --( Karengan - Yellow Curry Pill )--<br>
You gain your maximum Calorie Points. The ratios for spending CP
improve, becoming 1:3 for Akimichi clan jutsu, 1:1 for non-clan jutsu,
and 1:2 to reduce your Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina penalty.<br>
<br>
For the duration you are immune to knockback and halve the effects of
stuns, and have all your attributes increased by 15%. When you take the
pill, your Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina penalties are reset to 0. When
this ends, your Fatigue is increased by 4 categories.<br>
&nbsp; Duration: 100 + RES/4<br>
&nbsp; Poison: 6 - (RES/50)<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Tongarashigan - Red Chilli Pill )--<br>
You gain double your maximum Calorie Points. The ratios for spending CP
improve, becoming 1:5 for Akimichi clan jutsu, 1:2 for non-clan jutsu,
and 1:3 to reduce your Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina penalty.<br>
<br>
For the duration you are immune to knockback, and the effects of Stuns
and Paralysis effects are divided by four (round down). All your
attributes are increased by 25%. When you take the pill, your Chakra
Exhaustion and Stamina penalties are reset to 0 and your Fatigue is
lowered by 2 categories. When this ends, your Fatigue is increased by 8
categories.<br>
&nbsp; Duration: 100 + RES/2<br>
&nbsp; Poison: 9 - (RES/40)<br>
<br>
<br>
As you may notice, it's quite easy to go above &amp;quot;Fatigue
6&amp;quot;, which is to say, unconsciousness, by using these
pills. Pushing your body that far is dangerous, and hard to recover
from.<br>
<br>
For every Fatigue category you are beyond unconscious (i.e. Fatigue 8
would be 2 over), one Fatigue level takes an entire week to heal. For
example, if you were at Fatigue 9, you would be (7, 8, 9) 3 levels
above unconscious. This means that once you woke up, it would take a
week to recover from Fatigue 5, another week to recover from Fatigue 4,
another week to recover from Fatigue 3, and you'd then recover normally.<br>
<br>
After this effect takes place, you cannot regain any calorie points or
receive the benefits of food pills (they're still poison, though) until
you've fully healed from all Fatigue.<br>

## Inuzuka<br>
Like the ninken (ninja dogs) they fight alongside, the Inuzuka are both
highly spirited and very loyal -- to the good of Konohagakure and to
their individual friends. Despite being one of the smaller clans in
Konoha, their presence has long been valued by the village as a whole.<br>
<br>
For decades they have contributed to the strength of Konoha's scouting
and tracking units, aided greatly by their ninken. Inuzuka medics often
double as veterinarians, and many retire to work as vets or breeders
once they've finished serving as proper ninja. Most Inuzuka, even if
not permanently assigned to tracking squads, will be temporarily
'borrowed' to assist with missions where their skills will come in
handy at some point in their career.<br>
<br>
Physically, Inuzuka tend to be easily identifiable by the traditional
red markings on their cheeks and slightly more fang-like canines. An
Inuzuka is very rarely seen far from his or her ninken, even from
childhood years. An Inuzuka's dog is a friend, playmate, and ally in
battle. Inuzuka train with their ninken starting even before their
academy years, ultimately culminating in some of Konoha's most
physically destructive taijutsu.<br>
<br>
The Inuzuka are often characterized as blunt and rough around the
edges, taking things from playful to what most others would consider
hurtful. Nonetheless, they're very protective of their teammates and
typically mean well.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
<br>
##### --( Tsuga - Passing Fang )--<br>
The user spins his body at incredible speeds, the surrounding chakra
and air creating the appearance of a long vortex rotating along its
axis. The user in this state then rushes to make direct contact with
the victim. It can be extremely damaging, as it is capable of ripping
through great tree trunks or chakra-reinforced earth barriers.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 20 + X<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Damage: (STR /10)d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: AGI<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The effectiveness of partial defense is doubled against this technique;
for every 1 point it hits by, it deals 10% damage. Every time someone
is hit by this technique, they remove 1 off the top of their partial
defenses. (For example, I needed to hit 10 above to get 100%, now I
only need to hit 9 above. 8 being 90%, so on.) This resets to normal if
you choose to take a non-Tsuga, non-interrupt action. Every time you
use this after the first, consecutively, this technique's Stamina,
Speed, and Range are only considered to be half. Blocking is only 25%
effective against this technique.<br>
<br>
Tsuga's range is reduced by anything that would reduce your ability to
move (such as immobilization penalties); when you use Tsuga, you cross
to melee range with your target. The &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; in
Tsuga's Stamina cost is (the number of yards you move this way)/10,
rounded down.<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
##### --( Shikyaku no Jutsu - Four Legs Technique )--<br>
Using this technique, the user takes on much more animalistic
mannerisms, hunching down to all-fours and baring his teeth, for
example. Even his physical characteristics become more animal-like:
canines and fingernails grow into fangs and claws, pupils become
slitted rather than rounded. More importantly, the user's reflexes,
senses, speed and strength rise in power dramatically. The Inuzuka
often utilize this technique to launch effective hit-and-run offenses
against an opponent.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Your AGI counts 20% higher for purposes of movement and the range of
your clan jutsu. You also gain a +3 bonus to Awareness and Survival,
though while you are using this, you cannot make handseals except for
Inuzuka clan jutsu.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Jujin Bunshin - Beast Human Clone )-- <br>
Derived from the basic Henge, this technique transforms the ninken into
the likeness of its owner, though the ninken will still behave like an
animal in this form. However, together with the Shikyaku no Jutsu, the
two become virtually indistinguishable. Gatsuga often follows quickly
upon use of this technique. This technique also shares the same basic
weaknesses of Henge. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 3 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6 <br>
<br>
Effects: <br>
This technique changes your dog into a lookalike of you. In this form
it can now use Tsuga as well . Unlike regular Henge, this technique
will be broken only when the dog is knocked out of action (The Inuzuka
takes a Major or Higher wound). &nbsp;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Gatsuga - Fang Passing Fang )-- <br>
Tsuga twice over.&nbsp; Both shinobi and transformed ninken
coordinate their Tsuga movements to most effectively devastate the
opponent or create an opening. Thus Gatsuga is typically much more
difficult to avoid than Tsuga.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 25 + X/10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /6)d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: AGI<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This attack uses two accuracy rolls, one for you and the dog. First,
determine if the attack which rolled higher hits; if it does, the
attack with the lower result has its accuracy increased by 5. For
example, if you rolled 1d20+8 -&amp;gt; 12+8 -&amp;gt; 20 for
yourself, and 1d20+6 -&amp;gt; 9+6 -&amp;gt; 15 for your dog,
you'd see if 20 hit whatever defense your opponent used. If it did,
your dog's attack's accuracy would be raised to 15 -&amp;gt; 20.
This counts as performing Tsuga twice, though there is no reduction of
Stamina or Speed, only Range for consecutive use of this.<br>
<br>
You must spend 10 AP and your ninken must have an activation within the
speed of this attack, missing it's next activation. You combine the
damage of you and your ninken's attacks for purposes of wounding. If
you wound, it is treated as two separate wounds (1 Piercing, 1 Blunt)
of a lower severity.<br>
<br>
Gatsuga follows the same rules as Tsuga for traveling to your enemy,
and increasing the Stamina cost accordingly.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Jinju Konbi Henge: Sotoro - Human Beast Combination
Transformation: Double-Headed Wolf )-- <br>
This fearsome transformation technique combines shinobi and ninken into
a massive two-headed wolf. While being in this form has its obvious
benefits, this technique is most valued as an essential preparation for
the Inuzuka's most devastating form of Tsuga.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 7<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Your dog combines with you and may no longer take separate actions. You
gain a +4 bonus to Acc and D20 Rolls. Your physical damage bonus is
increased by 3. You also gain a +5 bonus to Awareness and Survival,
though while you are using this, you cannot make handseals or stealth.<br>
<br>
This technique overrides Four Legs technique, and will automatically
stop it if used. (It cannot be used while you maintain this either!) If
you take a Major wound, you are separated.<br>
<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
##### --( Garouga - Wolf Passing Fang )--<br>
In Sotoro form, the user creates a vortex similar to Tsuga; however,
the speed and power of Garouga far surpasses any of its lower forms. In
fact, the user spins so rapidly during the technique that he loses his
effective field of vision. The target is tracked, instead, by scent,
the Inuzuka using their enhanced canine senses to find their opponents.
Inuzuka have split opponents right in two with direct hits from this
attack.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR /4)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: AGI<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you use this technique, make an opposed Survival vs. Athletics
roll. If opponent succeeds in their Athletics check, they add the
amount they won by to their defense against this jutsu.<br>
<br>
Partial defenses have no effect against this jutsu, and unless you
dodge it by 5, you still take 50% of the damage. This technique
bypasses blocking, DR, cannot be parried by weapons or unarmed and if
you wound someone it is treated as three separate wounds (1 Piercing, 1
Blunt, 1 Slashing) of a lower severity. This jutsu's damage also counts
50% higher for purposes of wounding.<br>
<br>
Garouga follows the same rules as Tsuga for traveling to your enemy,
and increasing the Stamina cost accordingly.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### Ninken<br>
Your ninken, or ninja dog, is more than just an extra weapon in combat;
it's a living creature with its own capabilities. However, its
advancement is intextricably tied to your own.<br>
<br>
The values below are based on your XP.<br>
<br>
&lt;BBr&gt;<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Skills ]=-<br>
<br>
Your dog also has the following ranks in these skills:<br>
Awareness: 5 + XP/300<br>
Stealth: 5 + XP/500<br>
Survival: 5 + XP/200<br>
<br>
In other words, your dog starts with 5 ranks in Survival, Awareness,
and Stealth. It gains XP/200 ranks in Survival, XP/300 ranks in
Awareness, and XP/500 ranks in Stealth.<br>
<br>
If you and your dog are traveling together, you may reroll a skill
check, using your dogs skill. This only works with the three skills it
has.<br>
<br>
This does not apply in combat, and does not apply when you two are
separated; if you have your dog wait in hiding somewhere while you go
elsewhere, it uses its own rolls. <br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Actions ]=-<br>
<br>
When fighting with you, the dog can act every 20 IC. It uses your stats
for it's attacks and counts as suffering from any status effects you
are. There are three things the dog can do when it acts:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Basic Attack<br>
Speed 8, (Dex/6)d6 and uses half your PDB.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Grab<br>
Just as E-rank Grapple. This uses your relevant stats at 60%.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stealth<br>
Your dog uses stealth! It's basic attack uses your full PDB if it gets
to surprise attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
Using Beast Human Clone, it can perform Tsuga and for the grapple is
uses 80% of your relevant stats. This has an AP cost equal to half the
action's base Speed; the actual Speed of the technique may then be
modified further by spending more AP.<br>
<br>
Your dog does not need to dodge, it cannot be targeted or caught in an
aoe. When an Inuzuka is dealt a wound of Major or Higher, the dog is
knocked out of action for 10 IC per severity (Major is 10 IC, Severe is
20 IC, etc.). The severity of wounds caused by area techniques is one
higher for this consideration alone. (A Minor wound from an area
technique would knock the dog out for 10 IC, a Major for 20 IC, etc.) A
Critical from an area technique will knock the dog out for the rest of
the combat. If the dog is already knocked out, the duration it's
knocked out cannot be extended, only once it's back up can be beat down
again.<br>
<br>
When fighting alone, your dog can use your dodge with a -6 penalty, but
if it's hit once, by anything that deals damage, it's knocked out.<br>
<br>
<br>
```<br>

&nbsp; <br>
##### -=[ Dog Abilities ]=-<br>
<br>
These are obtained automatically, once every 500 XP. Choose one from
the list below; you may not take an ability more than once unless it
says so.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Good Nose:<br>
Your dog has +3 ranks in Survival, and +1 rank in Awareness. You may
take this ability up to 5 times.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Sneaky:<br>
Your dog has +3 ranks in Stealth, and +1 rank in Survival. You may take
this twice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Swift:<br>
The dog gains a +2 Dodge when it's on it's own. This can be taken three
times.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Vicious:<br>
Your dog's basic attack die size goes up to D8s. You can take this a
second time to make it D10s.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Well-Trained:<br>
Your dog has +1 rank in Awareness, Stealth, and Survival. You may take
this up to 5 times.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
## Hyuuga<br>
Throughout their history, the Hyuuga have adhered closely to a
tradition of segregating family members into either the Main House or
the Branch House, typically on the basis of gender and sibling birth
order. Members of the Main House control and direct the affairs of the
Hyuuga clan at large, whereas the Branch House is tasked with
faithfully serving and protecting members of the Main House and -- in a
wider scope -- the interests of the entire Hyuuga clan.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This practice of sealing Branch House family members, however, came to
its end through the concerted influence of three famed Hyuuga of the
Fourth Shinobi World War.&nbsp; Thanks to their tireless spirit,
cooperation, and heroic reputation garnered from the War, they won the
crucial number of Main House members to their side, greatly healing a
rift between the houses that had been ever-widening in previous
decades.&nbsp; Soon afterward, the head of the Hyuuga clan decreed
that thenceforth none would be branded with the seal. <br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
With the divide between the houses now gone, the Hyuuga have risen to
prominence both within and beyond their village as one of the most
noble clans of Konoha.&nbsp; They are widely known for the distinct
milky-white eyes, dark hair, and sophistication in the way they dress
and talk.&nbsp; Shinobi of other nations tend to be wary of them,
as their gentle fist style of fighting makes it impossible to tell just
how competent a Hyuuga may be by their physical stature, with legends
of one touch being enough to cripple an opponent.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### Hyuuga begin with 1 less Unique Point.<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Byakugan - White Eye )--<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Activating the Byakugan is a Speed 0, Seal Speed 6 action; it can't be
used as an interrupt. Once you've reduced its Seal Speed to 0, you no
longer have to perform handseals to activate it. Byakugan has an Upkeep
of 2.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You can differentiate between people and clones (except for Kage
Bunshin), and tell if someone is using Henge (though this does not
allow you to see their true form).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The Byakugan allows you to see through physical objects (though you're
still aware of their presence). This gives you, in crude terms,
&amp;quot;X-ray vision&amp;quot;, except you see chakra instead
of bones and dense objects. You can see everything in a CHA yard radius
around you this way. &nbsp;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This allows you to spot jutsu-based traps and effects, and detect the
presence of fuinjutsu placed on a person, item, or area.&nbsp; When
actively searching for an opponent in combat, you have a +10 bonus to
that Awareness roll. <br>
<br>
It also means that you're immune to all visibility penalties from
external sources, such as blindfolds, ninjutsu-induced mists, and smoke
bombs.&nbsp; You are immune to Genjutsu which target an area
instead of people, can automatically see through them as if they
weren't there, and can tell when someone else is being affected by a
Genjutsu from the disturbance in their chakra flow.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
##### --( Hakkeshou Kaiten - Eight Trigrams Palm Revolving Heaven )--<br>
The absolute defense of the Hyuuga clan, to use this technique the
ninja simultaneously releases chakra from every tenketsu in their body
and begins spinning rapidly.<br>
<br>
The combined effect is to generate a virtually impervious shield of
rotating chakra; what makes it truly effective is that the chakra used
won't dissipate until the user finally comes to a stop.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 5 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: No base damage.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt, Abort<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Byakugan active<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique's base Speed (6) is what is used for determining whether
it can Interrupt a given attack. If used as an Interrupt, you make an
accuracy roll with a +X/2 bonus against the opponent's Accuracy;
failure means you are hit, but activate Kaiten immediately afterwards.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Kaiten lasts for its full Speed in IC after being used. For example, if
you used it on IC 22 when attacked, paying 8 Chakra and Stamina, it
would last until IC (22+6+3) 31. Any time after the first 6 IC have
passed, you may abort Kaiten.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Kaiten flawlessly deflects any ninjutsu or taijutsu. Though it cannot
be used to Interrupt genjutsu, you cannot be targeted by them while
Kaiten is in progress.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Kaiten's radius is up to CHA/10 yards. Anyone in range when it's
activated who fails to dodge takes damage and is knocked to the edge of
the radius. If Kaiten is activated inside of a persistent AoE effect
(such as a cloud, or water slick) with a radius equal to or less than
its own, it ends that effect.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This technique's only true weakness is that it is ineffective if the
user cannot spin. If suffering from a -6 or greater immobilization
penalty, you may not utilize Kaiten.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may not reduce Kaiten's Speed by spending AP.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
##### --( Hakke Kuushou - Eight Trigrams Empty Palm )--<br>
One offensive counterpart to the defensive Hakkeshou Kaiten.&nbsp;
Rather than releasing chakra from all tenketsu to form a protective
barrier, chakra is released from certain tenketsu, typically the
forearm and palm, to create a forceful thrust, which damages an
opponent at a distance.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: +5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Byakugan active<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is added to any Gentle Fist attack (basic attack or combo),
increasing its Chakra cost and Speed accordingly. It allows those
techniques to be performed at the listed range (and, accordingly, does
not break combos). Because this changes those techniques into what is
essentially a wave of force, it prevents them from being parried as
normal unarmed taijutsu (though most ninjutsu-based defenses will still
apply normally).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
It cannot, however, be used to extend the range of the various Gentle
Fist Finishers.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
##### --( Juukenpo Ichigekishin -&nbsp; Gentle Fist Art One Blow
Body )--<br>
Another offensive use of the Hyuuga's ability to release chakra from
his tenketsu.&nbsp; Here a force is created and directed against an
opponent, or even against the espied weakness of some technique in
order to dispel it, using the Byakugan's ability to see
chakra.&nbsp; In either case, the force created can easily send
most opponents flying.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Byakugan active<br>
<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
This can be used when in a grapple, or when you would, due to a jutsu
restraining you (such as Water Prison), be unable to take actions. In a
grapple, this immediately ends the grapple and automatically strikes
your opponent with a basic attack Jyuuken.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Otherwise, this immediately ends any effects restraining you, from
being tied up with ropes to being trapped inside a Water Prison. If
used against a jutsu, X is that technique's Upkeep (if it has one).
Otherwise, X is zero.<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Jyuuken - Gentle Fist ]=-<br>
<br>
Jyuuken is a special way of fighting which works by infusing one's
blows with chakra and injecting it directly into the opponent's bodies
at weak points on their chakra circulatory system.<br>
<br>
There are two ways of performing jyuuken. The first is as a basic
unarmed attack, as follows:<br>
<br>
##### --( Jyuuken - Gentle Fist )--<br>
The offensive combat style of the Hyuuga. Making use of Byakugun's
ability to see an opponent's chakra flow, the user engages in what seem
to merely be graceful taijutsu strikes.&nbsp; In reality, with
every contact the Jyuuken user is injecting his own chakra into
calculated points within the opponent's chakra flow, sealing them off
and damaging internal organs directly.&nbsp; Save for unique
physiology or other abilities, Jyuuken is notoriously difficult to
defend against once contact is made.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank E<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 1d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Opener<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
Effects:<br>
Jyuuken uses half your ninjutsu damage bonus, instead of your taijutsu
damage bonus. Its damage cannot be blocked, and it cannot be stopped by
armor. Jyuuken's damage is dealt directly to an opponent's HP.<br>
<br>
<br>
You may also 'convert' any Combo Taijutsu to jyuuken. This represents
you adapting the basic concepts of it to the unique Hyuuga style;
virtually all jyuuken strikes are delivered with relatively light
finger-jabs (inflicting their injury through the bursts of chakra).<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This techniques use your ninjutsu, rather than physical, damage bonus,
cannot be stopped by armor, and reduce the effectiveness of blocking by
25%. Techniques converted this way gain a Chakra cost equal to their
Stamina cost. You cannot switch from a regular combo to a jyuuken
combo, though you can go from an ordinary Opener to a jyuuken combo.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
If you have amassed a Combo Counter from performing jyuuken combos, you
will be able to use one of several jyuuken-specified finishers, listed
below.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Hakke Sanjuuni Shou - Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms )--<br>
A simplified version of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. As its
complexity and difficulty are reduced, it's easier for novice Hyuuga to
learn, and has some advantages in battles when one needs a quick
advantage, lacking the time or energy to resort to more advanced
versions of the technique.<br>
<br>
The user launches into a series of high-speed jyuuken strikes at an
enemy, aiming to temporarily disable them--more advanced versions can
effectively remove an opponent from the battle entirely, and while
Thirty-Two Palms typically lacks that capability, it's nonetheless a
force to be reckoned with.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 1d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Finisher<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Byakugan active<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Combo Bonus: +1 Stun, +1d6 damage, Special<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
For the combo bonus, you may choose between one of the following three
effects:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; (Combo Counter)/3 Sealed Tenketsu <br>
&nbsp; &lt;Br&gt;<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; (Combo Counter)/2 Paralysis, with a Duration of
(Combo Counter)*5<br>
&nbsp; &lt;Br&gt;<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; (Combo Counter) Immobilization, with a Duration
of (Combo Counter)*5<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
##### --( Hakke Rokujuyon Shou - Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms )--<br>
A devastating series of Jyuuken strikes carried out in rapid
succession, sealing many of the opponent's tenketsu in the
process.&nbsp; The strikes are made in increasing powers of two:
two strikes, followed by another two, then four, then eight, then
sixteen, then thirty-two, for a total of sixty-four strikes. The damage
to internal organs and chakra flow is often so debilitating that the
victim can no longer stand.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 0d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Finisher<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Byakugan active<br>
<br>
Combo Bonus: +2 Stun, +1 Immobilization, +2d6 damage, Special<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This finisher's Immobilization lasts until its stun has worn off. For
the combo bonus, you may choose between one of these two effects:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; (Combo Counter)/2 Sealed Tenketsu<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; (Combo Counter)/2 Paralysis, with a Duration of
(Combo Counter)*5<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
##### --( Hakke Hyaku Nijuuhachi Shou - Eight Trigrams One Hundred
Twenty-Eight Palms )--<br>
The ultimate and most demanding Jyuuken combination strike, the final
development of the Hakke Rokujuyon Shou.&nbsp; The shinobi's speed
and chakra control have reached truly amazing levels, effectively
doubling the strikes made from sixty-four to one hundred twenty-eight.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 0d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Finisher<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Byakugan active<br>
<br>
Combo Bonus: +1 Sealed Tenketsu, +0.5 Paralysis, +1 Immobilize, +3
Stun, +3d6 damage<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The Paralysis and Immobilize last until the Stun has worn off.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
##### --( Sealed Tenketsu )--<br>
This is a status effect. Every tenketsu sealed gives you a -1 penalty
to Chakra Exhaustion rolls; half this total penalty is applied to your
Stamina rolls. Furthermore, if you fail a Chakra Exhaustion roll while
your Tenketsu are sealed, whatever technique you were trying to use
fails to activate (but you advance a Fatigue level as normal) and you
lose Vitality (or HP) equal to the Chakra cost of that jutsu.<br>
<br>
Sealed Tenketsu stacks partially with itself. If you already have the
status applied, and are struck by another attack which it inflicts it,
add half (rounded down) the lower severity to the higher; this is the
new severity of your Sealed Tenketsu status. For example, if you were
at 3, then hit by an attack which inflicted Sealed Tenketsu 5, your
status would be (5 + 3/2) = (5 + 1) = 6. Another attack with ST 3
would, then, raise you to 7.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
## Nara<br>
A modestly-sized yet highly influential clan in Leaf, the Nara
primarily use secret ninjutsu techniques which manipulate shadows,
using them to disable opponents and control the battlefield.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
What they're truly known for, however, is their many medical advances.
While the clan produces few talented medical nin, a disproportionate
number of the advances in theory and actual, physical medicines and
treatments seem to come from the Nara. The pills used by the Akimichi
clan are just one example of the Nara's medical breakthroughs.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The Akimichi, Nara, and Yamanaka clan have always enjoyed a special
relationship with one another, often working in teams and as allies;
that bond stands at the heart of Leaf village, and is often looked to
by other shinobi as an example of Konoha's unity.<br>

<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Kagemane no Jutsu - Shadow Imitation Technique )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The most basic of the Nara's techniques, the user extends their shadow
and links it to another person's. Once successful, the two are
physically linked, giving the Nara exceptional physical control over
their victim.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA /3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Effects:<br>
This requires a ninjutsu strike with a -3 penalty, which is removed if
a Flash Bomb has been used in the past 5 IC.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The victim can, as a Speed 10 action, attempt to break free, which is a
1d20+STR/5 OR RES/5 roll with a -5 penalty, against your 1d20+CHA/5.
Every attempt to break free gives a cumulative +2 bonus. The victim may
take no other actions which require physical movement.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You can make the target perform and taijutsu you know, use any weapon
they have, and ninjutsu or genjutsu you both know, and perform any
mundane tasks, including forcing them to disarm themselves. They pay
the Stamina and Chakra costs for any actions you make them perform,
though you must perform the same actions.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
If you attack them, they use the same attack against you. You can use a
Large weapon to attack them without being hit if they have a non-Large
weapon (or no weapon), and any non-Small weapon to attack them without
being hit if they have a Small weapon (or no weapon).<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &lt;Br&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
You may perform any ninjutsu or genjutsu you know against them; if they
know the same technique, they perform it as well, directed at you.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may make them attack someone with any technique you can force them
to perform, with a -3 penalty to their Accuracy. You can also attack
the same target as them, at the same time. For all the above methods of
controlling their actions, your Speed is advanced by the appropriate
amount, and theirs is not.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
If the victim is attacked, you can either choose to defend for them,
partially relax the technique long enough for them to defend
themselves, or force them to take the hit without defending. If you do
this, they immediately get a roll to escape with a +5 bonus, which they
may, after seeing the result, add 10 to per point of Willpower they
spend.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Multiple Shadow Bind )--<br>
You can target multiple people with your Kagemane no Jutsu. Every
person beyond the first adds 5 to Kage Mane's chakra cost, and 2 to its
upkeep. You may target up to 1 additional person per rank.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limit: CHA /30<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Kagebuki Shibari no Jutsu - Shadow Neck-Binding Technique )--<br>
A more advanced version of Shadow Imitation, this extends the user's
shadow up a victim, creating elongated hands and arms to wrap around
and strangle, or otherwise injure, the victim.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
Effects:<br>
This can be used only on someone who's already trapped by your Shadow
Imitation Technique, and as such does not require an Accuracy roll. If
used consecutively, its Chakra cost is reduced to 15.<br>
<br>
This can be used to strangle, or attack. Used to strangle, it inflicts
Suffocation 1 every time it's used. When you take any other action
(including movement and defensive actions) the Suffocation is
considered to have ended.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you may use this to directly damage an opponent, dealing
only your damage bonus multiplied by its speed. This damage cannot be
reduced below half by effects such as damage reduction and jutsu. It's
automatically a called shot, and wounds it inflicts cannot be prevented
by armor. Defending against Shadow Neck Bind is not possible. This
technique inflicts Blunt damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Kage Nui no Jutsu - Shadow Sewing Technique )--<br>
This materializes shadows, allowing them to physically attack and bind
an opponent (and, well, leave the ground). The user reshapes their
shadow into several needle-tipped tendrils and attempts to impale an
enemy with them.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 8d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
Effects:<br>
This cannot be used while Kagemane no Jutsu is maintained. It inflicts
a -4 immobilization penalty on anyone affected; you may target as many
people with Shadow Sewing as you can with Shadow Imitation, without
increasing its cost. Shadow Sewing has a +3 bonus to its Accuracy.<br>
<br>
You may use Shadow Imitation on anyone affected by Shadow Sewing,
ending the latter effect and automatically snatching them in your
Shadow Imitation. Someone trapped by Shadow Sewing can still take a
Speed 10 action to try to break free, using the same roll as if they
were escaping from Shadow Imitation. This technique deals Piercing
damage.<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Kagemane Shuriken no Jutsu - Shadow Imitation Shuriken
Technique )--<br>
By infusing weapons with chakra, you give them the properties of your
shadow techniques. Using these to pierce the enemy's shadows anchors
them in place.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Chakra Flow, Shadow Imitation Technique<br>
Effects:<br>
This is a thrown weapon attack, using that attack's Stamina and Speed.
It inflicts a -2 Immobilization penalty on the victim, rather than
doing damage. Multiple applications of this technique can be applied to
the same person, up to a maximum of -8. These penalties last until the
victim has taken a Move action with a Speed of double the total penalty
they're under, -1 per 40 points of STR they have.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Kageyose no Jutsu - Shadow Endgame Technique )--<br>
Working on the same principle as the Shadow Sewing Technique, this uses
materialized shadows. Unlike Shadow Sewing, it allows for precise
control of the shadow's movements; the user splits their shadow off
into potentially dozens of fully prehensile shadow tendrils, small
enough to slip through keyholes and dexterous enough to lift keys off
of hooks.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: Varies<br>
Effects:<br>
You can create shadows of tendril to grab, retrieve, and throw objects.
This costs 1 AP per CHA/50 yards away the item is. Throwing them is
handled as a regular thrown weapon (or multi-throw) attack, costing 1
AP per 2 Speed of the attack; you may use the Shadow Imitation Shuriken
Technique with these weapons. These attacks use your ninjutsu, rather
than physical, damage bonus.<br>
<br>
You may continue to use Shadow Endgame so long as you maintain its
upkeep.<br>
\page<br>
## Senju<br>
<br>
Once known as the Senju Clan of the Forest, and allegedly descended
from the Sage of Six Paths, founder of ninjutsu, himself, the history
of the Senju clan is the history of Konoha. They founded the village,
the First, Second, and Fifth Hokages were all members of descendants of
the clan, and it's said the First Hokage used his Senju bloodline to
create the very village itself. Their name, meaning Thousand Hands,
came from their peerless talents in all aspects of ninja skills: if
there was every a 'greatest clan' of ninja, it was them.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
They're also virtually extinct. The clan itself died out generations
ago. Of the perhaps dozen people alive who actually were born with the
Senju name, almost none of them actually manifest their clan's
abilities.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The bloodline is as persistent and hardy as the forests it symbolizes,
though. In every generation, a handful of ninja will be born who
exhibit the traits of the Senju bloodline, and inevitably their lineage
will be traced a Senju ancestor, sometimes more than a century distant.
Some even unofficially take the Senju name out of respect.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Senju begin with Elemental Aptitude for Water and Earth. They have
Elemental Affinity for Mokuton, which includes Sution and Doton.<br>
<br>
##### Senju begin with 1 less Unique Point.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Mokuton - Wood Release )--<br>
The Senju bloodline, once famed for their limitless talents, have
fallen far, but one trait remains--or, rather, it's the only one that
can be recognized as a sign of Senju heritage. That is Mokuton,
combining Water and Earth natured chakra to produce wood-related jutsu.
It should be noted that this is wood, specifically, and to a lesser
extent, trees--they don't have (despite what legends claim) plant
empathy, the ability to restore life to wilting flowers, or anything
similar.<br>
<br>
Any Suiton or Doton technique can be converted to Mokuton, with the
following effects:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; +5 Chakra cost<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Gallon requirements for Suiton techniques are
removed.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Suiton techniques which normally apply
visibility penalties to any area instead apply Immobilization penalties
with a severity equal to half (rounded down) that of the normal
visibility penalty.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Any applied immobilization penalties that
normally fade over time take twice as long to fade.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; All Mokuton techniques add CHA/10, rather than
DEX/10, to your Accuracy, if this would be preferable.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; The Upkeep of Mokuton techniques is reduced by
CHA/30, to a minimum of half its original value.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; The Chakra Exhaustion penalties incurred by
using Mokuton techniques are reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Mokuton is weak to Raiton, but strong against
Doton and Katon.<br>
<br>
&lt;img <br>

src='https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/8/8d/Senju_Symbol.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20090302032847'
<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Moku Bunshin no Jutsu - Wood Clone Technique )--<br>
This technique takes advantage of mokuton's ability to accelerate plant
growth by converting some of the user's cells into, essentially, plant
matter; the wood clone physically buds off the user before taking on
their appearance.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 1 Willpower per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10, +3 per clone<br>
Effects:<br>
Wood clones follow most normal rules for clones, but have (CHA)*2 HP,
and your attributes. They do not suffer wounds and you may only ever
have up to three at once in existance. They may perform any action you
normally could, by spending 1 AP per 2 Speed of that action; however,
after reaching Fatigue 2 they decay into lifeless wood pulp and fall
apart. Wood clones may not take actions with a chakra or stamina cost
greater than 20+(your RES for taijutsu, or CHA for ninjutsu)/10.<br>
<br>
Wood clones have your mind, and can act independently. You are aware of
their location, and they yours, though your senses are not linked. You
may reabsorb a 'living' wood clone by touching it, in which case you
'download' all its memories.<br>
<br>
When Wood Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be Held
Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold
Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for
dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by
one category.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Mokuton: Shichuurou no Jutsu - Wood Release: Four Pillars
Prison Technique )--<br>
After completing the handseals, you place your hands on the ground and
channel your chakra beneath your target, where it bursts from the
ground as timbers which grow rapidly and form a wooden, usually cubic,
prism. The timbers used in this technique are heavily infused with
chakra, making them very resilient.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: Up to 20 yard x 20 yard x 20 yard cube<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
Effects:<br>
This is the Mokuton 'version' of the Water Prison and/or Water Drowning
techniques, which cannot be directly converted into Mokuton themselves.<br>
<br>
It creates a wooden cage around anyone who can't escape its area, which
has 200+(damage bonus)*10 HP, and reduces all damage it takes by your
CHA. People inside cannot attack people outside, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Mokuton: Jukai Koutan - Wood Release: Nativity of a Sea of
Trees )--<br>
This technique uses chakra to cause trees and tree roots to grow
rapidly, bursting from any surface. It's too unrefined to be used as a
direct method of offense, but can be useful for altering the landscape
of a battlefield.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: (Damage bonus)*5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
Effects:<br>
This overwrites any terrain-based effects on the area it's used on. By
changing the cost to 5 + X*2, it can be used to create a one-story
building. The complexity of this building is determined by your Chakra
Control.<br>
<br>
At 10 Chakra Control or less, it's more like a crude bundle of tree
trunks and branches that will at least keep most of the rain out. From
11 - 20, it's about as well-built as a log cabin, with up to three
rooms. At 21 - 30, it could actually pass for a real building, aside
from the lack of anything made of metal. At 31+ Chakra Control, you can
add a second story to the building.<br>
<br>

#### Uchiha<br>
The Uchiha clan once had a proud history, as one of the greatest
shinobi clans the world knew before the advent of ninja villages.
Unfortunately, by the present the only widely-known aspect of their
heritage is that they produced three of the greatest traitors in ninja
history: Uchiha Madara, Itachi, and Sasuke.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Perhaps it's for the best, then, that the clan was effectively
eradicated a hundred years ago--most of the stigma was left behind,
buried with their corpses.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Konoha has spared no effort in trying to revive the Uchiha clan, and
has been, surprisingly, successful. Special Jounin were assigned the
sole task of tracking down people with Uchiha ancestry--second cousins,
someone whose grandfather had married out of the clan, illegitimate
children--and encouraging them to reproduce with one another; either
through marriage, or emotionless affairs.<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt;<br>
<br>
It worked, though it took a few generations. Any child who manifested
the Sharingan was offered the Uchiha name, along with their entire
immediate family. These new Uchiha were encouraged to take pride in
their bloodline, and in the fact that they were resurrecting it. The
village offered a multitude of incentives, did its best to discourage
the stigma of shinobi who were essentially volunteering to be breeding
stock, and even constructed the budding clan its own compound--not to
isolate them, but to help them feel special. Despite some muttered
protests throughout the village, they were even reinstated as one of
Konoha's four noble clans.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Some shinobi are resentful of the perceived special treatment the
Uchiha receive; others take it in stride, accepting that it's in the
village's best interest to revitalize one of its most powerful
bloodlines. Admittedly, the Uchiha clan--now almost large enough to
actually be considered one, though most of its members haven't, and
never will, manifested its traits--has yet to live up to its legendary
prowess; it's claimed that in the past, all an Uchiha had to do was
make eye contact to force a foe to commit suicide. Whether or not they
ever shall reclaim their feared and honored status remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Outside of their normal training, all members of the Uchiha clan are
taught how to use Katon ninjutsu while growing up. Accordingly, they
start with the Elemental Aptitude ability for Fire.<br>
<br>
##### Uchiha begin with 1 less Unique Point.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### --( Abilities )--<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Sharingan - Copy Wheel Eye ]=-<br>
The sharingan is a doujutsu, or 'eye technique'; when it manifests, the
user's irises turn red, and a tomoe (essentially a comma-shaped mark)
appears in the iris, like a second pupil. Another tomoe appears in each
eye at the second, and then third stages, for a maximum of three.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp;
src='https://res.cloudinary.com/teepublic/image/private/s--4jzx312c--/t_Preview/b_rgb:191919,c_limit,f_jpg,h_630,q_90,w_630/v1446235336/production/designs/251253_3.jpg'
<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
The Sharingan's greatest disadvantage is that it is dependant upon
one's unimpeded visibility. None of the abilities provided by it may be
used when you're at a visibility penalty of -6 or greater (Mistborn
cannot help you in this regard).<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for the Uchiha, they are not inherently able to access
this power. In times of need--generally when under severe
combat-related stress--the doujutsu will activate itself. This is
GM-regulated; you'll be informed if this takes place. When it does,
your Sharingan immediately activates at the stage above the highest
you've achieved, and from then on you may activate that stage at will.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
However, once a shinobi is talented enough, they'll be able to activate
their Sharingan's higher stages for the first time without need for
that external stimulus. At 500, 1000, and 1500 XP you automatically
gain access the First, Second, and Third Stage Sharingan, respectively,
if you haven't already. Legends speaks of a fourth stage, though no one
in recent memory has obtained it.<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Sharingan, Stage 1 ]=-<br>
Maintaining the Sharingan active is almost trivially easy, a mere
Upkeep 2 effect. Activating it is a Speed 0 action, which can be
performed alongside another technique or Interrupt.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
At the first stage, you are able to acquire the Dousatsugan and
Saimingan techniques. Both are learned as D-rank jutsu, though have no
skill or rank requirements. You may choose to purchase these as soon as
you unlock Stage 1, even if you don't have enough XP to do so--in which
case you are, essentially, in 'XP debt' until you have enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Sharingan, Stage 2 ]=-<br>
The Sharingan's second stage adds a second tomoe to each eye, and is
when the bulk of the doujutsu's power begins to manifest. Their ability
to copy techniques and actions becomes refined, to the level of being
able to extrapolate from fine details and mimic even small mannerisms.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may obtain Yogengan and Shouningan. They are learned as if they're
C-rank techniques, though again, have no skill or rank requirements to
learn. You may choose to purchase them as soon as you unlock Stage 2,
going into XP debt if necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Sharingan, Stage 3 ]=-<br>
The third tomoe appears, with the three marks forming a ring halfway
between the pupil and the rim of the iris, equidistant from one
another. Upon reaching this stage, you can copy any genjutsu used upon
you by another Uchiha with their Eye of Hypnotism power, despite its
lack of handseals (again, assuming you meet the proper requirements).
You may also learn Magen: Kyouten Chiten and Senchigan. They're treated
as B-rank techniques, you know the rest by now.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Dousatsugan - Eye of Insight ]=-<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Stage 1 Sharingan<br>
You can see the flow of chakra. This gives you a +4 bonus to defense
rolls against genjutsu. More impressively, it allows you to copy any
taijutsu technique you witness being performed, along with any ninjutsu
or genjutsu which use handseals.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This technique's greatest limitation is its user. You must meet all
skill requirements for the technique, and can't copy elemental ninjutsu
you don't have the appropriate Elemental Aptitude for; Sealing and
Medical techniques both require access to those types of jutsu in order
for you to copy them.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This does have one advantage over learning techniques the
&amp;quot;old-fashioned&amp;quot; way: you can copy techniques
one rank above what you could normally learn (which may vary by
category).<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You automatically learn any valid techniques you see, and can use them
for the remainder of the day. To keep them permanently, you must pay
half the normal XP cost to learn the technique in question. You may go
into 'XP debt' learning techniques this way.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may not copy custom or clan jutsu, as those are tailored too
specifically to either the individual or the clan in question.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Saimingan - Eye of Hypnotism ]=-<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Stage 1 Sharingan<br>
You may perform genjutsu without handseals; however, this requires
direct eye contact, meaning it can't be used from hiding, must be
targeting a person (rather than an area), and can be avoided entirely
if they simply shut their eyes (which brings its own penalties) or
never look directly at your eyes (which can be done by just, say,
staring at your, or their, feet, and affects them with a -4 visibility
penalty).<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Yogengan - Eye of Prediction ]=-<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Stage 2 Sharingan<br>
Once per Fatigue category, you may declare use of this technique. It
allows you to &amp;quot;take 10&amp;quot; on any defensive
roll; rather than rolling 1d20, you treat it as if your result had been
a 10.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may also declare your action as 'Observe', a variable-speed action
similar to blocking, in that for its duration, when attacked you may
choose to activate Yogengan against any attack directed against you
(and not have it count as your one use for that Fatigue category).<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Shouningan - Eye of Recognition ]=-<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Stage 2 Sharingan<br>
For starters, you can read lips. This is not some kind of ultra
undetectable super-long-range spying technique; you have to actually
have a clear view of the person's lips, and it's sorta conspicuous;
though you can make an opposed Espionage roll to avoid them noticing,
if you're trying to hide the fact that you're staring at their face.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You can also copy a person's handwriting just by seeing them write a
single sentence. You can speed-read, and have a photographic memory.
This has other uses, such as being able to tell how to pick a given
lock by watching one person do it, or how to open a combination lock
(though not necessarily the combination itself) by watching the
movements of someone's arms or hands as they do it.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Magen: Kyouten Chiten - Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and
Earth Change ]=-<br>
A form of illusion reversal, in which a Sharingan user instantly and
simultaneously sees through and decrypts a genjutsu technique, and then
instantly reflects it upon its original user. Some Uchiha will go so
far as to claim that this technique makes them immune to genjutsu, and
they're... not too far from the truth.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Genjutsu<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6, Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Stage 3 Sharingan<br>
Effects:<br>
This may be used immediately after passing a defensive roll against a
genjutsu targeting you. You immediately perform that genjutsu on its
original user (paying its normal chakra cost) via your Eye of
Hypnotism, using your defensive roll's result as its new Accuracy. This
adds 6 to the initiative count on which you next act, as if it was an
interrupt. This can only be used on genjutsu which you know (though
copying them as they're performed, and then reflecting them, is fair
game).<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Senchigan - Eye of Foresight ]=-<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Stage 3 Sharingan<br>
It was once claimed, and rarely still is, that the Sharingan genuinely
allows its wielder to see the future. What it actually does is pick up
on minute changes in an opponent's posture, minor eye movements, slight
shifts of their weight, muscles tensing or relaxing in preparation for
movement, even chakra building up in preparation for a jutsu.<br>
<br>
When you declare the use of this ability, declare a category of
technique (such as Weapon Taijutsu, Katon, or Combo Taijutsu) and a
Speed. Your opponent then declares and rolls (if applicable) their
defense. Any Interrupt may be used that's valid against your declared
Speed.<br>
<br>
After seeing this result, you may choose to use any technique of the
declared type, with Speed equal to or lesser than your declared Speed.
Its damage is based on its normal Speed, but its ability to be
Interrupted, and when you take your next action, are based on the
declared Speed. Any technique used this way has its Stamina or Chakra
cost(s) increased by 4.<br>
<br>
If you choose to use a technique against which their reaction is
invalid (such as performing Doton: Domu after they had rolled a 20 on
their Suiton: Sujinheki), they do not have to pay the chakra costs or
Speed of their Interrupt. On the other hand, using a technique that
somehow bypasses their defense (such as Earthen Skewer against Kazekame
Kaigara no Jutsu) is fair game.<br>

## Yamanaka<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
A fairly small clan within Leaf, the Yamanaka are highly prized by
Leaf's reconnaissance and investigative divisions. In part, this is due
to the disproportionate number of Yamanaka who wind up being chakra
sensor shinobi.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
The Yamanaka have developed a specialize type of ninjutsu allowing them
to directly affect the minds of others, including seizing control of
another person's body. A disproportionate number of Yamanaka are also
chakra sensors, though it's still a minority of them.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
Members of the Yamanaka clan enjoy close relations with their Nara and
Akimichi contemporaries. There is even a monument in Konoha dedicated
to the alliance between the three clans. To this day, no foe or
circumstance has managed to even strain that bond.<br>

&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Sasayaki Kantoku no Jutsu - Whispering Oversight Technique )--<br>
Actually a fairly recent derivative of the Yamanaka techniques, this
was developed because their secret techniques, despite their seemingly
subtle nature, are quite over and obtrusive to anyone under their
effects. This technique allows the user to see through the eyes of
their target; as it lacks any visual cues, victims are typically left
completely unaware it's been used.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Genjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
Effects:<br>
You use all of the target's senses instead of your own. You are, far
all intents and purposes, hitching a ride inside their body. This does
not break Yamanaka Clan Telepathy, but you cannot use it (or any other
technique) while maintaining Whispering Oversight. Your body is
helpless, but you're aware if it's disturbed (shaken, stabbed, and so
forth).<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
```<br>

&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Yamanaka Clan Telepathy )--<br>
One of the subtlest techniques possessed by the Yamanaka clan is also
one of the ones most valued by their village. This allows instantaneous
telepathic communication between a group of individuals, a feat which
has virtually limitless tactical applications.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 4<br>
<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
This requires you to touch a person's head. Once activated, they are
part of your telepathic network; all people who you've brought in can
talk to you, and one another, mentally. You can have up to CHA/20
people linked this way, not counting yourself.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
You can remove someone from this link, and they can remove themselves,
at will. It has a maximum range of CHA*10 yards.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
If two Yamanaka link, their limits of people are combined, though each
Yamanaka counts as one person towards the total limit. The distance
limits are also pooled; as long as someone is within range of any of
the linked Yamanaka, they can remain part of the network.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Shintenshin no Jutsu - Mind Body Switch Technique )--<br>
The signature ability of the Yamanaka clan, this jutsu allows a
Yamanaka to send her mind into a target's body, seizing control and
keeping the victim, essentially, along for the ride. They're aware of
what's going on, but unable to take any sort of action.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 8<br>
Effects:<br>
If this hits, you gain control of the target's body. Their body uses
their attributes and abilities, but you retain your skills. You may use
any jutsu you know; however, elemental ninjutsu require the body to
also be able to use that element. You use the victim's elemental
affinity, rather than your own.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
During this time, your own body is helpless; it appears to be asleep,
and cannot be woken up by any means. You are aware of any injuries your
body sustains, but not its surroundings or condition otherwise.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
When the body you're possessing takes damage, your body takes the same
amount of damage.&nbsp; You receive any Wounds they suffer (but not
Wounds for your own Vitality or HP being depleted by this). When you
return to your body, your Fatigue increases by as many levels as theirs
did.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
Someone possessed by this technique has several options for trying to
escape. Whenever they are Wounded or advance a Fatigue level, they are
allowed a 1d20+CHA/5 roll, vs. your 1d20+CHA/5+5. They may also spend a
point of Willpower to get one such roll at any point. For each roll
they've made previously in the battle, they have a +1 bonus.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
You do not need to meet the normal skill or rank requirements for this
technique. If you miss, you suffer a Stun 25, but are not helpless;
you're still in control of your body, but disoriented.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Shinranshin no Jutsu - Mind Body Disturbance Technique )--<br>
A more potent variation of the Yamanaka's mind body switch technique,
this allows the Yamanaka to seize control of a victim's body without
abandoning their own. The control's not complete--a possessed victim
can still talk, shout a warning, and so forth, but they can't control
their actions beyond that.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
Effects:&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
You gain control of the victim's body. So long as this is in effect,
they cannot take any actions other than those you dictate. Unlike
Shintenshin, this does not have any feedback effects; the victim could
be killed, and you would be unharmed.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
Whatever action you force them to take has its normal Speed for them,
and costs you 1 AP per 2 Speed of the action. You may allow them to
choose their own defenses (in which case you do not pay AP for them) or
dictate which defensive actions they take (in which case you do).<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
Like Shintenshin, the roll to avoid these effects is 1d20+CHA/5, vs.
your 1d20+CHA/5+5. However, they get a cumulative +2 bonus for each
roll made. The triggers remain the same. However, if you force them to
not defend against an attack, or force them to take an invalid defense
(one which will not in any way protect them from the attack, such as
blocking a move which does not have its damage reduced by blocking)
they immediately get a roll to break the effect (before the
attack/defense is resolved), with a +10 bonus.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Shinten Bunshin no Jutsu - Mind Clone Switch Technique )--<br>
The final derivative of Shintenshin no Jutsu, this allows the user to
transfer their consciousness into multiple targets and gain complete
control over them. Beyond the obvious tactical advantages, this allows
for unprecedented coordination between the two bodies, as they share a
single mind.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank A<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45 + 5 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 5 + 2 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25 + 5 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
Effects:&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
This functions as Shintenshin no Jutsu, but you may target a total of X
people, up to a maximum of (CHA)/40. You receive damage, Fatigue, and
Wounds carryover from all victims.<br>
<br>

## Sunakagure No Sato<br>
<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp; src='http://i54.tinypic.com/ckb2h.jpg' <br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
Located in the eastern part of Wind Country, Sunagakure no Sato has a
stable, hot climate accented by very cold nights. The village is
surrounded by a partial caldera of sandstone and rock on three sides,
with a massive stone wall blocking the fourth, allowing one narrow
opening into the village. This opening is always guarded by highly
trained shinobi, making the village nearly inaccessible. The entire
village of Sunagakure is modeled around a giant compass, with main
roads reaching out from the village center in all eight directions.
Suna buildings are round in shape, and made of red adobe. This allows
for sand to blow around the buildings during storms, and for easy,
cheap repairs afterward. Because there is no room to expand outward in
Suna, they build upward, connecting these adobe skyscrapers with
enclosed pathways high above the narrow streets. <br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
Sunagakure was built on the backs of nomads who banded together to seek
refuge from Wind Country's harsh deserts. Of these nomads, the famous
clans of Suna were cultivated out of raw and untamed power. The people
of Suna, and similarly from all of Wind Country, have learned to cope
with these harsh climates - nearly unbearably hot days, freezing
nights, and violent wind storms. <br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Much like how the village was founded, during the recovery after the
Fourth Great War, desert nomads flocked to Sunagakure for protection.
With no room inside the village, they built up small camps outside.
Initially these camps were temporary, but after several generations
were born here the land outside Sunagakure became home. With so little
room, Sunagakure has had little choice but to build deep into the walls
of the caldera they depend on for protection to make room. Progress has
been slow, but steady. In time the nomadic camps and semi-temporary
buildings outside of Sunagakure will be only a vague memory.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Suna Shinobi begin in the academy later than Kiri or Konoha, and
graduate later than Konoha. Because students typically go into the
academy more mentally prepared for the challenges that lie ahead, their
overall quality of shinobi at graduation tends to be higher. In
Sunagakure quality reigns over quantity, so while they have the least
amount of shinobi compared to all Five Great Shinobi villages, their
modest numbers are able to complete just as much work. If it weren't
for such high quality of shinobi in Sunagakure, they'd not be one of
the Five Great Villages. <br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
In the past generation there have been rising tensions with Mist and
Stone villages as they have engaged in fierce competition over
missions. This has been enflamed by a number of 'incidents' and
skirmishes in which shinobi have been lost.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Regardless Sand will endure, for we are Forged by the Desert.<br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
### Henzaki<br>
Possessed of a rare, yet subtle, kekkei genkai, Sunagakure's Henzaki
clan is virtually unknown outside of their village. Even within Sand,
the most an average person knows about them is that they have some
manner of secret technique, body modification, or bloodline which makes
them hard to kill.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
It is a bloodline, one which gives them an incredible ability to
survive against adversity. Injuries which should be fatal prove only a
minor inconvenience to the Henzaki.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
The Henzaki have few defining characteristics as a clan, though many
are swarthy and dark-haired. All are in good physical shape, their
metabolisms self-regulating to prevent them from ever becoming over- or
underweight. Henzaki virtually never get ill, and never seem to age
past their forties.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
A well-known fact among Sunagakure's medic nin is that the Henzaki's
bloodline makes them all universal donors and universal recipients,
both for blood transfusions and organ transplants.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Homeostasis )--<br>
Henzaki physiology has an incredible ability to adapt, responding to
any changes in its environment or condition, every system function of
their body reacting instantly with a single goal: maintaining the
stability of their vital functions.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 20<br>
Effects:<br>
You reduce the Poisons status of poisons by RES/40, and take damage
every 2 IC, rather than every IC. If the poison's Poison severity is
reduced below half by this, all its other effects on you are negated.
Similarly, you reduce the severity of any Bleed statuses by RES/40, and
take damage every 10 IC, rather than ever 5.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Bleeding from sources other than the Bleed status (for example, the
Critical Piercing Wound 'Punctured Liver') is halved, and has its
duration halved; if it does not have a set duration, it stops after 100
IC.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Suffocation effects do not force you to make Stamina rolls, but still
apply normally. Even if you're killed, you won't truly 'die' until
reduced to -200% HP; you'll seem dead, all vital signs stopped, but
will then revive once you return to 1 HP.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Regeneration )--<br>
Among those who've worked alongside Henzaki for any prolonged period of
time, this is probably their most envied ability. A Henzaki will heal
in minutes from injuries that would take others hours to get over, and
in hours will have recovered from wounds that might take days for
ordinary people to recover from.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limit: 1 + RES /30<br>
Effects:<br>
You regenerate 1 point of Vitality per rank each Initiative Count, and
twice that amount of HP.<br>
<br>
In a given day, you can only heal (rank) times your maximums of each.
Thus, at two ranks in regeneration, if you had 1000 Vitality you could
only regenerate 2000 Vitality in a given day.<br>
<br>
Finally, you divide the total healing time necessary to recovery from
any wound that doesn't involve injured bones by 1+(0.5 * rank). Medical
attention cannot reduce it further; however, you can recover as if you
had medical attention, even if you do not, thanks to your regeneration.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp; --( Organ Mobility )--<br>
The secret to much of the Henzaki's longevity, and their
nigh-immortality, is their ability to control their body's internal
structure. If an organ has been punctured, they can force the wound
shut or use another organ to put pressure on it. If a compartment in
their body is hemorrhaging, they can force the lining to open and let
it bleed out to relieve pressure.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + 5 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
Effects:<br>
You immediately recover from any wound which doesn't somehow involve
your bones. The wound doesn't actually heal, but your body adapts in
some fashion to function despite it. This lasts for 24 hours, -6 hours
per category the wound is above Minor.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may spend 1 Willpower to use this when you're wounded (as a Speed 0
Interrupt in response to being wounded), in which case the wound is
negated entirely--you simply don't suffer it, don't have to recover
from it, and so forth.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
X is 1 for Minor, 2 for Major, 3 for Severe, and 4 for Critical wounds.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Sanguine Vitality )--<br>
As a result of their bloodline, Henzaki blood itself has a number of
interesting, medically significant properties. Most relevant to
shinobi, it can be rapidly metabolized by virtually anyone, and will
induce temporary, rapid regeneration. It still tastes like blood, and
since it has to be consumed fresh from the veins, it's not a
particularly appetizing prospect.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limit: 1 + RES /30<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This require someone to be close and still enough to drink your fresh
blood. Generally speaking the Henzaki will cut open their palm or arm
and suspend their regeneration, but simply biting them will suffice.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You can give up up to 1 point of HP (not Vitality) per rank for every 5
IC which pass. Each point of HP restores 5 points of Vitality (not HP)
to the recipient. A person cannot die while receiving blood from you.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
However, if either you or the recipient moves, or is forcibly moved, or
takes any other actions, this effect is broken. <br>
<br>
\page<br>
### Hitori<br>
<br>
It's unknown how the Hitori came to be, despite plentiful speculation
on the matter. The first possessor of their advanced chakra nature,
Scorch release, was a single person who lived nearly a century and a
half ago. Some theorize that centuries of living in the desert and
being exposed to its 'natural chakra' may have had a lasting effect on
some of the native people.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Battles involving Hitori outside of the desert leave their mark for
days, the dry air and parched soil lingering as if they'd brought a
little piece of Sunagakure with them.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Hitori themselves seem the very opposite of what you might expect from
a clan that dries up everything around them, the essence of energy and
youth throughout most of their lives. They tend to be very outgoing,
with fiery red hair and occasional groups of freckles on their face and
arms.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
They tend to train on the outskirts of Sunagakure and frequently
function alongside the Juugo Suto for this reason, often posted outside
the village proper--the fact that their powers are so inimical to life,
even that of other shinobi, may have something to do that.&nbsp;
Unwelcome guests within the Wind Country are usually run off by the
Hitori, who use their abilities in a subtle fashion to create living
conditions that quickly become unbearable.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Though a relatively new clan within the village, their abilities have
earned them prestige and a respected place within its hierarchy, and in
some ways they're considered to represent the spirit of the country
they live in.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Hitori begin with Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Wind ninjutsu, along
with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Shakuton, which includes
Katon and Fuuton.<br>
<br>
##### Hitori begin with 1 less Unique Point.<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Shakuton - Scorch Release )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Combining fire and wind chakra results in the advanced nature of
'scorch release'; as the name suggests, it involves using extreme heat
as a weapon, with powerful users being able to reduce opponents to ash
or evaporate the liquid inside their body.<br>
<br>
Any Katon or Fuuton technique may be converted to Shakuton, with the
following effects:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; +5 Chakra cost<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Shakuton techniques deal only 80% of their
normal damage; however, they cannot be blocked, and have +CHA/30
Accuracy.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Whenever you hit a target with a Scorch release
jutsu, their Dehydration status' severity is increased by (1 per rank
of the jutsu) + CHA / (90 - 10 * Rank). In other words, for an E-rank
this is 1+CHA/80, for a D-rank it is 2+CHA/70, and so on, up to
5+CHA/40 for A-rank techniques.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Your techniques can raise a victim's Dehydrate
status to a maximum of 3+(CHA)/8.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; All Ignite effects you inflict also add
Dehydrate of half the Ignite's severity.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Shakuton techniques cannot be reduced below
Speed 4.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Shakuton is weak to Suiton, and strong against
Fuuton and Raiton.<br>
<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp;
src='https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/powerlisting/images/1/19/Scorch_Release_Mummy.png/revision/latest?cb=20121106015715'
<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
##### --( Dehydration )--<br>
This is a status effect. Every point of Dehydration is a -1 penalty to
the victim's Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls. Dehydrate stacks
fully with itself; Dehydration 3 added to Dehydration 2 makes a single
Dehydration 5 status.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Anyone suffering from Dehydration also suffers the effects of Paralysis
equal to (Dehydrate's severity)/4. This is not an actual Paralyze
status, but a side-effect of the Dehydration; normal effects which
interact with Paralysis (such as some Raiton) do not affect it.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Unlike the Burns status, which similarly penalizes Stamina rolls, this
status is not cleared when someone fails a Fatigue roll. Instead, its
severity is decreased by RES/20 points every 10 minutes OOC (hour IC)
out of combat, but only so long as the victim is able to drink plenty
of water.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Evaporate )--<br>
Focusing your chakra over an area, you can cause water to evaporate.
This is a Speed 8 action, and removes X*2 gallons of water from the
battlefield, with a Chakra cost of 5+X. The maximum for X is CHA/10.<br>
<br>
This cannot target water used as part of a sustained jutsu (i.e. one
with an Upkeep).<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Kasou no Jutsu - Cremation Technique )--<br>
You focus your chakra on a victim, and simply light them ablaze.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
Effects:<br>
If this hits, it removes the victim's Dehydrate status and replaces it
with an Ignite of equal severity. This does enjoy Shakuton's typical
+CHA/30 Accuracy, and does apply a new Dehydrate equal to half the
Ignite's severity.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Sabaku no Keshin - Incarnation of Desert )--<br>
You project your chakra out across the battlefield, with devastating
results. The temperature rises, water begins to evaporate, some plants
may start to wilt, and hopefully nothing nearby is particularly
combustible.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Ninjutsu damage bonus *10<br>
Effects:<br>
Everyone within the range except you has their Dehydrate status
increased by 1+(your CHA)/40 when you activate this jutsu, and every 10
IC. This remains centered on you. Every time this effect takes place,
(CHA)/10 gallons of water are removed from the battlefield.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
### Juugo Sato<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp;
src='http://vintageninja.net/wp-content/uploads/Octagon-Norris.jpg' <br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
The Sand Foxes are not a 'real' clan, in any proper sense, and most
members do not have any blood relation to one another. The clan often
adopts orphans to raise and train.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
What they lack in secret or bloodline techniques, the sand foxes make
up for in training from a very young age to understand and be aware of
the environment. It's by no means cruel or harsh, but it's more than
what others go through.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Socially, they function much like any other clan, but have an unusually
strong close-knit, even familial bond with one another. The sand foxes
look out for their own. Within the village they're respected, and
usually return the favor. Many are introverted--at least around people
who aren't members of their clan--but few are sullen.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The Juugo Suto have a well-deserved reputation for being excellent
trackers and firmly loyal to their village. Almost every team of
shinobi sent to patrol the desert around Hidden Sand has at least one
sand fox member, and even outside the Wind Country they frequently
serve as scouts.<br>

<br>
##### --( Survival Instinct )--<br>
Most clans pass on secret techniques as a rite of passage. The Juugo
Suto have a somewhat different rite: once a member is ready they are
left alone, in the middle of the desert, without provisions or
equipment, and told not to return for at least a month; most of them
aren't even teenagers. It's a testament to the clan that virtually
every student is, in fact, ready to undertake this challenge, and
returns safely to the village. It's a testament to the ordeal that they
inevitably return from their journey changed: quieter, calmer, and
infinitely more aware of the world around them.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Effects: You are immune to surprise attacks.
Attacks which would normally not end an opponent's stealth still do not
do so, but they receive none of the benefits of surprise attacks
against you.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Sneak attacks against you instead follow the normal rules for surprise
attacks.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Tenacity )--<br>
Desert is some of the most difficult terrain to navigate, but the sand
foxes do it. They adapt to the harsh environment. It's not that it gets
any easier, or that they've learned any secret. They just face the
obstacles, assess them, accept them, and do what they must regardless.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limit: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Effects: You reduce the severity of any
immobilization and visibility penalties on you by 1, per rank. Each
rank also reduces the maximum immobilization penalty you can suffer
from by 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Desert Ghosts )--<br>
In the world of shinobi, there is no such thing as hunter and hunted;
one is both, at all times. The juugo suto are preeminently aware of
this. That awareness, and their mentality of never taking their safety
for granted, has led to no end of frustration for foreign shinobi
trying to guage the strength and frequency of Suna's patrols.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limiting Attribute: DEX /20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Effects: For every rank you have a +1 bonus to
Survival rolls, and anyone attempting to track you has a -1 penalty to
their roll. If you are leading a group with a size of your Survival
skill or less (including you), you may make a single Survival roll for
all members, and anyone trying to track the group receives a -1 penalty
per rank to their roll. Multiple Sand Foxes may work together, pooling
their Survival skills for the maximum size, and using only the highest
roll and penalty.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Intuition )--<br>
There are multiple sayings in Sand about a sand fox's intuition. Some
are jokes at their expense, often told by genin. And the clan bears
them without comment, because among the jounin those sayings are
proverbs.<br>
<br>
It's not, despite what some have speculated, anything supernatural. The
juugo suto can't actually watch every leaf in a forest at once, or hear
a feather falling. All they can do, and all they need to do, is be
calm, and watch, and listen, and know what about a setting is just a
little bit wrong.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 20 Awareness, 20 Survival<br>
Effects:<br>
All enemies are treated as being 1 Stealth category lower than they
actually are, to you; this mainly applies for reducing their Stealth
bonus when you're looking for them.<br>
<br>
This does allow you to attack an enemy in Stealth 1, though you may do
so only with ranged attacks, and then at a -3 penalty to
Accuracy--you're going by intuition, and essentially firing blind.
Area-of-effect attacks do not suffer from this Accuracy penalty.
Similarly, you are inherently aware of the presence (though not
location) of anyone only in Stealth 1--they can't sneak up on you.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
### Kairaishi<br>
<br>
Not actually a clan at all, Kairaishi is a term reserved for those in
Suna who embrace a specific method of fighting: manipulation of
weaponized puppets.<br>
<br>
Learning to do so takes years of training, and with the exception of a
handful of geniuses every few generations takes up almost all of one's
free time during their academy years. Most puppeteers learn everything
they know being mentored by a master of the art, who will typically
take only one student at a time.<br>
<br>
One of the greatest assets of puppeteers is their ability to
essentially multiply their forces on the battlefield. A skilled
puppeteer can control several human-sized puppets at once, potentially
tipping the numbers in their side's favor.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Kugutsu no Jutsu - Puppet Technique )-- ***<br>
The Kairaishi's signature technique and a unique ninjutsu, this allows
the user to extend strands of chakra from their body and attach them to
puppets.&nbsp; Using the puppets, they can attack and manipulate
them from range while remaining relatively safe themselves.&nbsp;
The better the user's control over their chakra, the better they can
control puppets by the strands connecting them.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 1 + X/2 (round down)<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You gain control of 1 + X puppets which are uncontrolled on the
battlefield. At all times, one of these puppets is designated as your
primary puppet. You choose this at the start of any combat, and may
change your primary puppet by spending 10 AP. Many techniques use this
puppet as the main source of your attacks or defenses, your other
puppets supporting it, just adding a bonus to your attack. If they were
puppets which you haven't worked on (i.e. someone else's) have a -3
penalty to all actions with them. While controlling puppets, your hands
are not free for handseals, using weapons, or so forth. By default
(i.e. without any ranks in Puppet Mastery, below) you may only control
1 puppet at a time. You do not have to keep track of puppet IC.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
While maintaining this technique's Upkeep you may take the following
actions.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Control Puppets: Attack Formation (Speed Variable, AP
X)&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
1 + X puppets will attack, using whatever the primary puppet is
equipped with to decide what you have available. The speed of this
technique is the speed of the primary puppet's choice of attack. If you
spend AP to AP this down, the puppet's attack is also
reduced.&nbsp; The attack has a +1 bonus for every two puppets in
the formation. This may be used to cause your puppet to perform any
Taijutsu (Unarmed, Combo, or Grapple) you know, as well any Weapon
Taijutsu you know which they have the proper weapon for. Doing this
requires you to pay a Chakra cost equal to that technique's Stamina
cost.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Control Puppets: Defensive Formation (Speed Variable, AP X,
Interrupt)&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
1 + X puppets will move to protect you. You may choose any defense the
primary puppet is equipped to do. The speed of this is based on the
speed of the defense used.&nbsp; If you spend AP to AP this down,
the puppet's defense is also reduced.The defense has a +1 bonus for
every two puppets in the formation.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Control Puppets: Dodge (Speed 2 + X / 2, Interrupt, AP 1 + X /
2)&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Up to 1 + X puppets dodge a technique. This may be used alongside the
user defending themselves (You may dodge too!).<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Control Puppets: Prepare (Speed 5)&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You prepare yourself to do something involving your puppets. This
generates 5 AP, which does count towards your maximum but may only be
used in actions taken with Kugutsu no Jutsu.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Control Puppets: Move (Speed Variable)&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may move any number of puppets at once, using no AP. Every 1 AP you
do choose to spend increases the Speed of their move action (but not
this action, for you) by 2.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Puppet Mastery )--<br>
A novice puppet master needs both hands to direct the motions of a
single puppet, often using a finger for each joint or something
similar. A master learns how to split their chakra threads, and with as
little as the twitching of a single digit and modulating of their
chakra flows gracefully direct their puppets.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limit: XP /500, max 9<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may control 1 additional puppet at a time with Kugutsu no Jutsu for
each rank in this ability, up to a maximum of 10 (one per finger) with
all 9 ranks.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Kugutsu Henge no Jutsu - Puppet Transformation Technique )--<br>
With this technique you can channel chakra through your puppet to give
it your own appearance. This is typically done in conjunction with an
actual disguise put on the puppet in case the technique fails, as it
suffers from the same limitations at normal Henge.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6<br>
<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You disguise your puppet to look like you.&nbsp; This has all the
limitations of normal Henge, but without any worry of a false
impersonation:&nbsp; You know how you look and act to mimic
yourself perfectly.&nbsp; Consequently, you have a +5 to your
Espionage roll against people figuring out your puppet isn't you.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Anything that detects normal Henge will also detect this technique, and
if the puppet takes damage the technique ends immediately.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### ---( Kugutsu Kuchiyose no Jutsu - Puppet Summoning Technique )--<br>
Most puppeteers don't carry all of their puppets out at once to give
themselves a tactical advantage, instead using this technique to keep
them stored in scrolls, to be summoned in battle when needed.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5 + X*2 per puppet<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed:&nbsp; 5 + X*2 per puppet<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 6<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You summon X amount of puppets you've stored in scrolls ahead of time,
which you can then use.<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Souen: Hitomu Gokuu - Puppet Performance: Skillful
Achievement with a Human Body )--<br>
A technique developed amidst the First Shinobi War, this jutsu became
highly regarded by puppet master's allies and enemies, as it allows
them to continue fighting even after their puppets have been destroyed,
gaining a new ally with every enemy defeated.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank A<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You gain control of a corpse on the battlefield.&nbsp; If the body
has more than 3 Major Wounds, 2 Severe Wounds, or 1 Critical Wound, it
is too badly decimated to be of use and can't be used with this jutsu.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The body functions exactly like a normal puppet would, using your CHA
in place of their STR, and your DEX in place of its DEX and
AGI.&nbsp; Unlike normal puppets, you use the body's normal HP
amount to determine Wounds, and once it has received too many wounds,
the body is considered destroyed and no longer usable.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you can connect your Chakra Strands to that of a willing
target to empower them.&nbsp; While you are connected, you suffer
from an Upkeep 15, and the following effects occur:<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; The target uses the higher of yours or their
bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls (not taking into account the penalty
from this move's upkeep).<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; The target can choose to use your chakra instead
of theirs, in which case you take the any effects (chakra penalties or
lowered fatigue) as a result of chakra exhaustion rolls, instead of
them.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; The target has access to all jutsu you know, and
can use any elemental jutsu that they or you has the appropriate
aptitude for.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; The target can use theirs or your Ninjutsu
Damage Bonus, whichever is higher.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Both the target can you can end the upkeep at any point you wish,
severing the connection.&nbsp; Any techniques which were dependent
on the connection (like a Doton upkeep move, while the target doesn't
have aptitude for Doton) immediately end.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Anything that can target and destroy chakra threads can also do so to
disrupt this technique. While maintaining this technique in either form
you cannot control puppets.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>

<br>
#### -=[ Puppets ]=-<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The weapon of choice of puppeteers, these range from the size of a
small human to that of a large animal. There are no 'standard-issue'
puppets, though the village does have a stockpile of old and unused
ones which can be borrowed. Puppets are usually custom-built by their
user or inherited and modified from that person's mentor.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You have XP/50 Puppet Points (PP). All parts have a cost in PP
(admittedly, some as low as 0); the total of all parts used iin any
single puppet can go up to your max PP. This is not actually a
resource, per se, but a measurement of skill.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Within your limits, you purchase parts using Requisition or Savings.
Swapping out parts on any number of puppets can be accomplished with a
single day of downtime back in the village; once you leave on a
mission, you're stuck with what you've got.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
In the village, puppets can be repaired between scenes. When on a
mission it takes an IC hour of dedicated work to restore 10% of the HP
of a single puppet, due to lacking the proper tools and resources.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Puppets are immune to genjutsu and all status effects other than
immobilize and ignite. They take only half damage from ignite. Since
you are controlling them, your visibility penalties apply; other status
penalties on you do not.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Puppets use your CHA in place of their STR, and your DEX in place of
their AGI and DEX. They do not have RES or CHA. They can move (As
detailed above) but cannot move more than your CHA in yards from your.
Otherwise, puppets receive all your bonuses to accuracy and rolls, such
as from abilities and uniques.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Finally, puppets are complicated pieces of equipment. Their biggest
weaknesses are their joints and other moving parts. If a puppet is
suffering from an immobilization penalty of 6 or higher, it cannot act
or be used with any part of Kugutsu no Jutsu.The most basic, and
expensive part of the puppet. The frame of a puppet is constructed from
chakra-conducive wood, and all the puppets' various parts are anchored
to it.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Frames are divided into several general categories, described below.
Each frame has a PP capacity for action location, for example
&amp;quot;Head: 3 PP&amp;quot;. This means that you can fit up
to 3 PP worth of upgrades in that location, if you're using that frame.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
By default, a frame can accommodate one torso, one head, two arms, and
one pair of legs. Each arm has its own, separate PP capacity, but legs
are outfitted as a pair.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
While you can pay for these parts using Requisition or Savings, be
aware that once you've bought something with Savings you cannot return
it for a refund. You can still upgrade it, but not remove existing
upgrades.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Note: Additional legs increase movement speed by 25% per pair. Every
two additional arms gives a +3 bonus to any roll based on STR,
including grapples.&nbsp; Despite the fact legs and arms come in
pairs, cosmetically there could be more or less; a centipede puppet
might be described as having dozens of legs, even if it only actually
had three pairs.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>

#### Frames<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Small&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Ranging in size from a medium-sized dog to a human child, these frames
have the advantage of not requiring a lot of material and being
reasonably forgiving in construction.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this also means they're easily
destroyed.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;HP: 200&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Head: 3 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Torso: 3 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arms: 2 PP each&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Legs: 4 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Cost: 100 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Special: You may exchange two arms for a second pair of legs, but not
vice versa. The puppet has a +2 bonus to Stealth rolls, and +3 to
dodge.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Medium:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Generally the size of an adult human, these are the most widely-used
and adaptable puppets. They have a balance of strength and speed, and
can endure longer battles than more delicate models, while also
retaining plenty of mobility.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;HP: 400&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Damage Reduction: 10&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Head: 5 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Torso: 6 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arms: 3 PP each&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Legs: 6 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Cost: 250 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Special: Increasing the cost by 100 Ryo allows you to fit on another
two arms or one pair of legs.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Recon:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Somewhere between a small and medium frame, with light but sturdy
materials, this frame is optimized for stealth and reconnaissance
puppets.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;HP: 250&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Head: 8 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Torso: 3 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arms: 2 PP each&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Legs: 4 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Cost: 200 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Special: +5 Stealth&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinforced:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Using the medium frame as a base, these use stronger and heavier
materials, reinforced joints, and armor plates. While these are
exceptionally sturdy as a result, it's too compact to allow for the
extensive customization most puppeteers enjoy.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;HP: 500&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Damage Reduction: 25&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Head: 2 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Torso: 2 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arms: 1 PP each&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Legs: 2 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Cost: 200 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Large:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The biggest and most expensive puppets, these tend to be build with a
specific purpose in mind. They have above-average durability and great
storage space, but can be impractical in certain situations. The
smallest of these are easier larger than a large
person.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;HP: 350&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Head: 5 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Torso: 10 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arms: 4 PP each&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Legs: 6 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Cost: 300 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Special: -5 dodge, -5 stealth, and -2 accuracy. Adding 100 Ryo to the
cost allows you to add an extra two arms, or pair of legs. You may
spend up to 300 extra Ryo this way.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Upgrades ]=-<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Below are upgrades you can apply to your puppet's torso to make it more
effective at whatever it is you want its purpose to be. Unless
specified otherwise, you can apply these upgrades as many times as you
have the PP and money for. Upgrades here do not count towards the PP
capacity of any of the puppet's locations.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Armored&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your puppet is covered with armor plates, or sturdy pieces of wood.
This reduces any damage it takes by 5 points, stacking with its
existing damage reduction.<br>
&nbsp; PP: 1&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased Capacity&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You can fit more things in your puppet! This increases the PP capacity
of a single location by 1.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 2&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiet Joints&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your puppet can move without its components clicking together and
causing all sorts of noise. This costs gives a +3 bonus to Stealth. You
may take this twice.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 2&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sturdy&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your puppet is especially durable. You can spend 1 PP and 25 Ryo to
increase its HP by some amount, depending upon its frame
size.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Small: +50&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Medium: +75&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
#### Head<br>
Camera&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You install a camera inside your puppet's head! It follows the normal
rules for cameras (see Gear, in the Equipment chapter), though its
presence is typically not obvious, since it's... you know, inside the
puppet's head. You need film for it; see below.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
PP: 3&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Cost: 500 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Film Reel&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You install a roll of film in your puppet's head. Goes well with the
camera! Each 'unit' of film (i.e. one picture) costs 25 Ryo. A single
reel can hold up to ten of these. You can install multiple film reels,
if you want to be able to take more than ten pictures.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
PP: 1&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Cost: 0 - 250 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hidden Weapon (Melee):&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You have a concealed weapon, typically a blade of some sort. This
cannot be disarmed, and can be used to attack in grapple. The first
time in a battle it's used, it's an automatic surprise
attack.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This weapon is modified to be usable by the puppet; you can't remove it
and fight with it yourself. It can be any Small-sized Slashing or
Piercing weapon from the Equipment chapter of the PHB; the cost of that
weapon is added to the cost of his upgrade.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 3&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 100 Ryo + Special&lt;Br&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hidden Weapon (Ranged):&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your puppet has a weapon launcher inside of its head. It can hold up to
twenty kunai, shuriken, or senbon, which must be paid for normally. You
can purchase this multiple times, each time adding to the capacity
getting a separate launcher for a different type of
weapon.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 1&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 25 Ryo + Special&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perception&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
By placing small, chakra-conductive components in the head of the
puppet the user can see and hear what the puppet sees and hears. This
upgrade can be toggled on and off as a Speed 0 action. While using it,
you suffer visibility penalties, and make Awareness checks, based on
your puppet's location and 'senses' rather than your own. You can only
use this for one puppet at a time.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 2&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Voice Box&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Using a chakra-based speaker in its head, your puppet can talk!
Specifically, it can transmit your voice, or a distorted and
unrecognizable version of it.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 1&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 20 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
#### Torso<br>
Exploding Torso&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
By placing exploding tags in the body of a puppet, the thing is turned
into what is essentially a walking bomb. This allows you to store up to
(Chakra Control skill ranks)/5 Exploding Tags inside the puppet. You
may detonate them as a Speed 10 action while controlling the puppet.
The puppet takes double the full damage, anyone inside or grappling it
may choose to block (though not dodge). The range is 20 yards, +1 per
tag after the first, and the damage is the total damage of all the tags
used in this. The accuracy penalty for not being able to escape an AoE,
however, is halved. You must pay for the exploding tags
separately.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
If a puppet loses all its HP after doing this, it cannot be repaired
without returning to a village and rebuilding it
entirely.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 3 ; it costs an additional 1 PP per tag, which may be
taken from any location&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 100 + cost of exploding tags&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hollow Body:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
All puppets are hollow, but this modification creates a spacious,
shell-like area inside the torso of the puppet. This is large enough to
fit a person and, depending on the design, may have eye holes too look
out from. If so, Awareness checks can be made, but at a -4
penalty.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Getting into or out of the puppet is a Speed 8 action; it can be locked
from the inside. However, while inside you may not use perform
handseals (too cramped), attack or be attacked, or control your other
puppets.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
A person inside cannot be attacked until the puppet has been
destroyed.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 8&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 150&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinforced:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your puppet is reinforced. No, really. Each application of this
increases the puppet's HP by 25.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 1&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 10&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Trap Body&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
An elaborate arrangement of wires and launches inside a hollowed out
torso which, when triggered, fire and wrap around a target, then
quickly retract to pull them into the puppet to capture
them.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
When the puppet is attacked in melee, this can be declared in place of
a defensive action; it's a Speed 10 Interrupt, which costs 5 AP to use
(via Chakra Threads). The puppet takes half damage from the attack, and
the attacker must then defend against this attack.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
If they fail, they are trapped and locked inside the puppet's Hollow
Body; Trap Bodies lock (automatically) from the outside, and cannot be
opened from the inside without destroying the puppet. The person inside
is limited to basic unarmed attacks against the puppet while inside.
This can only be deployed once per battle, after which it needs to be
reset.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 4&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 200 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
#### Arms<br>
Chakra Shield:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Installed in an arm, these deploy by unfolding umbrella-like wooden
spokes and briefly projecting a temporarily solidified shield of
chakra. This is a Speed 5 Interrupt, and costs 3 AP to use, if used to
defend the puppet, it's used alongside a Control Puppets: Dodge, and
instead of adding Speed it just costs 5 AP.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The shield will block up to CHA*5 damage. If this stops an attack
entirely, subtract half that attack's damage from CHA*5; that's how
much 'HP' the shield has remaining for future uses. If an attack does
more damage than the shield's HP the puppet takes any carryover, and
the shield is unusable for the rest of the battle.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Even if this blocks all damage from a technique, it will not stop any
other effects (such as immobilization or ignite).&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 3&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Equipped Weapon&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your puppet has a weapon it can use in its arm. This can be any weapon
with a Stamina cost of 10 or less; you may increase the maximum Stamina
cost by 5, by increasing the PP cost by 1. The puppet increases an
Accuracy bonuses on the weapon, and and penalties by 2. It may
dual-wield only (Dual) weapons, and those only at your level of the
Dual Wielding ability. You must pay for the weapon
used.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
To use a two-handed weapon, this must be purchased for both arms which
will be using that weapon. The cost of the weapon itself only has to be
paid for once.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; PP: 1 - 4&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 50 RYo + Weapon's cost&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flamethrower:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
A contraption which sprays a mist or stream of some combustible
substance and ignites it with chakra on contact with oxygen. This
enables the puppet to, as the name suggests, project powerful gouts of
flame.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This is a Speed 14 action for the puppet. In addition to doing
(CHA/8)d10 damage, this inflicts Burns 6 and Ignite 5 if the target
fails a status roll, using your Chakra Control.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 1 for the mechanism, 1 per 2 uses&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 50 for the mechanism, 25 per 2 uses&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glider:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Special, folding wings installed inside the arms of your puppet, this
can extend and retract as necessary. To be useful you must install this
upgrade in both arms of a pair. This upgrade halve the puppet's
physical damage with those arms.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The puppet can fly. An airborne puppet may not carry people (via Hollow
Body). A flying puppet is immune to any effects reliant upon contact
with the ground (such as some immobilization penalties) and cannot be
targeted by melee-range techniques unless it made a melee-range attack
in the past 25 IC.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 2&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 150 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grapple Arm&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your puppet can fire off its hand, with a rope attaching it back to the
arm. This allows your puppet to initiate a Grapple at a distance as a
Speed 10 action. From there it can, as a separate Speed 6 action, draw
itself to the person in question. From there it may perform any Grapple
jutsu you know when you make it attack.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 2&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 75 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hidden Weapon:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This is an upgrade to a weapon the puppet is already equipped with.
That weapon is concealed inside the puppet's arm and spring-loaded. The
first time it's used in a battle it is automatically a Surprise Attack.
This cannot be done with a Large weapon. After this upgrade, the weapon
cannot be disarmed.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 2&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 25 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
#### Legs<br>
Hidden Weapon:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
By hiding a weapon inside the puppet's leg, it allows the puppet to,
well, attack with that weapon. Weapons of less than Large size may be
installed. Weapons used may have a Stamina cost of up to 10, +5 per
extra PP spent on this upgrade.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The first time the weapon is used in a battle, it is an automatic
Surprise Attack. This uses the weapon's damage, speed, and so forth.
You must pay for the weapon separately from this
upgrade.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 2 - 4 PP&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo + Weapon's cost&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mobile Legs:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Special legs designed to go over any terrain, be it rocks, water, ice,
or even up cliffs. These legs reduce immobilization penalties based on
the condition of the ground by 1; you can stack this benefit by giving
this upgrade to multiple pairs of legs. These legs can also use Water
Walking and Wall Walking, if you have those abilities.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; PP: 3&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tail:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your puppet replaces its legs with a tail! This reduces its movement
speed by 25% (or, if the puppet still has another pair of legs, the
pair converted into a tail just doesn't provide a 25% increase in
movement speed) but reduces immobilization penalties based on the
condition of the ground by 2, and all other immobilization penalties by
1. Outfitting multiple pairs of legs with this upgrade stacks its
effects by improving the size and quality of the tail.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This upgrade gives your puppet a +4 bonus to grapple rolls; that
benefit does not stack if multiple pairs of legs have this. The tail is
prehensile, and may grip and grab things, and counts as a single limb
in a grapple.<br>
&nbsp; PP: 3&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Cost: 100 Ryo&lt;Br&gt;<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The Monkasei lineage--they haven't organized themselves into a proper
clan, despite gentle prodding from the village to do so--is viewed in
generally good light by the people of Sand. Much of that comes from the
fact that every member who displays their kekkei genkai is directly
descended from the Third or Fourth Kazekage; the two weren't directly
related, but most likely had a common ancestor, since they possessed an
identical, or nearly identical, bloodline. It also helps that the
Monkasei, as a general rule, are fairly modest about their bloodline
and heritage.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
That advanced bloodline is the ability to create magnetic chakra, and
seems to have actually gotten stronger in recent generations; the Third
Kazekage was hailed as the strongest Kazekage his village had ever
seen, rivalled only by the Fifth, but his control of magnetic chakra
was limited only to iron dust; he did not possess an actual magnetic
jutsu.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
On the other hand, that may simply be a result of the passage of time.
He may well have been the first of his kind, and he had nobody's
mistakes and successes to learn from. Even if the bloodline hasn't
grown more powerful, it has become more refined, and while the number
of inheritors is fairly small, they're flourishing and growing in
number.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
Monkasei begin with Elemental Aptitude for Earth and Wind. They have
Elemental Affinity: Jiton, which includes Doton and Fuuton.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### Monkasei start with 1 less Unique Point.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
<br>
##### --( Jiton - Magnetism Release )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
What sets the Monkasei bloodline apart from its peers is their advanced
chakra nature. Though commonly referred to as 'magnetic'
chakra,&nbsp; there's more to it than that: even non-magnetic
metals can be affected by their abilities. Most Monkasei realize their
powers well before they can use ninjutsu, or sometimes even mold chakra
at all, when they start intuitively dragging metal objects to them.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Any Raiton or Doton technique can be converted into a Jiton technique,
which the following effects:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; +5 Chakra cost<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; All Jiton techniques have Magnetize 1 if they
hit.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; For every 25% higher the techniques damage is
considered for wounding, the technique applies 1 to the Magnetize. If
it cannot be blocked, it adds 3 to the Magnetize. For every 5 chakra
over 30 a technique costs (Base), the technique applies 1 to the
Magnetize.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; All Jiton techniques have their base Speed
increased by one per rank (1 for E, 3 for C, etc.). Thus, a Jiton
Retsudotensho would be treated as a Speed 25 action for all purposes
(including its minimum Speed after reductions), rather than 22.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; All Jiton techniques have their total Speed
(which as a reminder cannot be reduced below half their base Speed)
reduced by the severity of their target's Magnetize. For example, if
you were using the area-of-effect move Doryuu Taiga against four
people, who had Magnetize 4, 8, 2, and 0, your technique's total Speed
would be reduced by 8.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; All Jiton techniques have their Chakra cost
reduced by their target's Magnetize severity.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Jiton is strong against Raiton and Suiton, but
weak against Katon. All Jiton techniques are considered as projectiles
when determining how effective Fuuton-based defenses are against them
(not because they necessarily are projectiles, but due to the elemental
weakness).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Magnetize )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This is a status effect, which represents the target having become
magnetized. Magnetize stacks fully with itself; someone with Magnetize
8 who's hit by a Magnetize 1 technique is elevated to Magnetize 9.
However, a Jiton technique cannot raise a person's Magnetize over
2*(rank). Thus, a person with Magnetize 2 who was hit by an E-rank
Jiton technique would not have their Magnetize status increased.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Jiton techniques used against someone with a Magnetize status get an
Accuracy bonus equal to the status' severity. Metallic thrown weapons
have an Accuracy bonus equal to half the status' severity. Magnetize
fades entirely half an hour after the last time it was applied.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Denji Yuusei - Electromagnetic Dominance )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your manipulation of magnetic chakra has lots of potential uses! All of
the following have a Chakra 10 cost, and are considered to be Jiton
Ninjutsu effects.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
When throwing metallic weapons (arrows are no good for this) you may
use CHA/10 in place of DEX/10 for your accuracy bonus.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You may also deflect attacks with any metal weapons, ranged or melee,
by making an accuracy roll. This uses your CHA/10 in place of DEX/10,
and receives any bonuses from having magnetized your opponent. This is
a Speed 1 Interrupt<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Finally, you may disarm an opponent's held weapon as a Speed 6 action,
rolling 1d20+CHA/8 against their 1d20+STR/10, once again receiving
magnetize bonuses. If succsessful, you may throw the weapon up to CHA/4
yards in any direction, or bring it to yourself (and, if you wish,
wield it).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You can retrieve, as a Speed 4 action, any discarded metal weapons or
used projectiles within CHA/2 yards, bringing them to yourself.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Mujona Kaiho - Merciless World Order )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
By no means the most powerful of a Monkasei's abilities, this is one of
the most visually impressive. You project your magnetic chakra out
across the battlefield, and use it to seize control of any discarded
metal weapons--kunai, shurikens, even swords. Using that control,
you're able to attack with impunity without having to make a single
motion.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Jiton Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 4<br>
Effects:<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
While this is maintained you may spend AP to make ranged attacks with
any metallic weapons present and not being held on the battlefield.
They have a range of CHA/2 yards, and use your ninjutsu, rather than
physical, damage bonus.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This costs 1 AP per 2 Speed it would normally cost to attack with the
weapon; the weapon uses its base Speed for damage purposes. This uses
your CHA instead of DEX for Accuracy. These weapons don't benefit from
weapon-specific abilities. They receive the full Accuracy from
Magnetize as if this was a Jiton ninjutsu, but none of the other Jiton
effects (such as applying more Magnetize) apply.<br>
<br>
<br>

### Sabechi<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
When Sunagakure initially organized itself into a formal village of
Ninja, the Sabechi were the tribe most resistant to allying themselves
with those who had been their rivals for generations.&nbsp; They
fought against change and the alliances that were being made, relying
upon nature for their survival against what quickly became a much
larger force.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
In doing so, they resorted to extreme measures.&nbsp; While no
Sabechi ever confirmed as much, it is suspected that they tried all
manners of profane rituals and struck bargains with the most dangerous
and amoral of the species to be found within Sunagakure, which is how
they began to produce a poison from their own blood.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Eventually they did assimilate into the village, sufficiently impressed
by the collective force of the tribes.&nbsp; For a long time they
voluntarily segregated themselves, but over time they formed bonds with
the Henzaki and the Hitori in particular, impressed by the former's
talents and admiring the Hitori's spirit. The three clans, often teamed
together, form an odd balance of sorts; a Sabechi's dark humor, a
Henzaki's withdrawn neutrality, and a Hitori's overzealous enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Members of the clan are not a very vocal sort, with a sense of humor
that is often classified as 'twisted'.&nbsp; While well-mannered,
most Sabechi have a sense of wit which invariably carries undertones
not fully understood by those they converse with until well after
they've spoken, making those that meet them frequently question just
what they meant.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>

#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>

&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Rustblood )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The very blood of a Sabechi is poisonous.&nbsp; Along with minor
inconveniences, like it being harder to give them transfusions and them
being ineligible to ever donate their blood, it can also be used in
combat as a very potent venom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limit: 1 + XP/100<br>
<br>
You can poison a weapon on your blood as a Speed 5 action by inflicting
1 point of damage on yourself. This applies 1+(Toxicology)/5 doses
worth of poison to a melee weapon, or poisons up to that many thrown
weapons. Your Rustblood poison has a +4 bonus to all its Toxicology
rolls.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This poison's severity begins at 1, and increases by 1 every 4 ranks.
It has a base Duration of 10. For every rank of Rustblood, you gain one
Poison Point.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Because this toxin is dependent upon the precise physiology of the
Sabechi who produces it, it will break down rapidly outside their body.
This prevents it from being stored for any significant amount of time,
and means it can't be used to lace food or drinks.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Poison Points are spent to add the following effects to poison,
declared when you envenomate a weapon. These effects all have costs
that function the same as ability costs, which you spend PP (rather
than XP) on. For example, Paralytic is Base 3 / Scale 2. This means the
first rank costs 3 PP, the second costs 5 (for a total of 8), and so
forth.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You may not unspend and respend Poison Points at well; once spent, they
are allocated. However, you may choose to use less than your full
value; for example, your poison might have Paralytic 3, but you could
choose to make a single use of it only Paralytic 1. <br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This is significant because each PP spent on applied effects increases
the Vitality (or HP) cost by 1. So, using your poison at Paralytic 3
would add +15 Vitality to its cost, while Paralytic 1 would only add +3
Vitality.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Paralytic&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Your poison debilitates the victim's muscles, slowing their ability to
react. This inflicts Paralysis 1 per rank.<br>
&nbsp; Base: 3<br>
&nbsp; Scale: 2<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Necrotic:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Your poison causes rapid cell death around the area struck. Aside from
taking longer than usual to fully heal, this inflicts Immobilization 1
per rank.<br>
&nbsp; Base: 2<br>
&nbsp; Scale: 1<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Irritant:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
There are many ways of accomplishing this. The most common is including
some chemical in the poison that will cause an allergic reaction in
most humans. Whatever the method, your poison causes irritation and
possibly inflammation, and inflicts Burns of its rank in severity.<br>
&nbsp; Base: 1<br>
&nbsp; Scale: 1<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hallucinogen&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Affects the senses and mental functions of its victims, causing
temporary disorientation and delirium.&nbsp; It inflicts a -1
Visibility Penalty per rank.<br>
&nbsp; Base: 2<br>
&nbsp; Scale: 1<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neurotoxin&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Causes a temporary overload of the nerves, which stops proper brain
function for a few moments.&nbsp; Can be deadly in the midst of
combat.&nbsp; It inflicts 2 Stun per rank.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Base: 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scale: 1<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Virulent&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Your poison is especially deadly, taking a longer than normal time to
metabolize. This increases the Duration of the poison by 5. The first
three ranks of this effect cost 1 PP; the next three cost 2 PP; the
next three cost 3 PP, and so forth. So, for +50 Duration (10 ranks)
you'd need to spend (1*3 + 2*3 + 3*3 + 4) = 22 PP.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Mithridatism )--<br>
Constant exposure to the Sabechi's own venom eventually has their
bodies produce antibodies to a variety of poisons, building up an
immunity to even the nastiest kinds of venom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Base: 5<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scale: 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit: RES /30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
For every rank, you reduce the rank of any Poison you suffer from by
1.&nbsp; If you reduce the Poison's severity to 0 by this, you add
a bonus to the Resistance roll against all secondary effects of the
Poison equal to the Poison's severity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Predatory Protrusions ]=-<br>
Every Sabechi has a way to deliver their poison naturally, without the
aid of weapons--such is the nature of their
bloodline.&nbsp;&nbsp; As their skill expands and chakra
develops, it's not unheard of for a Sabechi to begin manifesting other
mutations.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You choose one of the four mutations below at creation.&nbsp; For
every 2000 EXP you have, you can voluntarily choose to lower your
maximum Willpower by 1 to acquire an additional protrusion.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You may taken the Weapon Focus ability for &amp;quot;Natural
Weapons.&amp;quot; This applies to any attacks made with your
Sabechi clan mutations.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Stinger )--<br>
The most obvious of all the mutations and the signature feature of the
clan, a Sabechi's stinger is far more potent than a scorpion's, even
though they look about the same.&nbsp; It's much longer than it
looks, able to extend over the Sabechi's shoulder or around their side
to strike those in front of them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/10)d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: -5 Accuracy<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You have a flexible tail with a curved tip.&nbsp; Most Sabechi tend
to wrap it around their waists as a type of belt, but some let it hang
behind them.&nbsp; You can attack with the Stringer even in a
grapple, and if you do so you don't suffer the normal Accuracy
penalty.&nbsp; If you strike with this weapon, you can inflict a
dose of your poison. When attacking with your tail, your Rustblood has
no Vitality cost. Your tail inflicts Piercing wounds, and in a grapple
you may make your attacks automatic called shots at no penalty.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Quills )--<br>
While not true &amp;quot;needles&amp;quot;, some Sabechi
actually have the ability to straighten the hairs on their head, which
tend to be much thicker than normal hair, enough so to inject trivial
amounts of their poison.&nbsp; When used in groups, however, it can
be quite deadly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: Variable<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Variable<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: Variable<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is treated as a Senbon multithrow, though it does not require the
normal ability to do so.&nbsp; If you use at least three Quills,
you can deliver a dose of your poison with them. Unlike actual senbon,
you won't run out of quills.<br>
<br>
These are not actual senbon, and do not benefit from any
senbon-specific abilities. Poisoning your quills requires the normal
Vitality cost for your Rustblood, but does not have the maximum of
1+(Toxicology)/5.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Saliva )--<br>
Sabechi who happen to deliver their poison this way tend not to get
many dates, leading it to be the least common of all the mutations
found within Sabechi, but those who have it swear by its usefulness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (CHA/10)d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed:&nbsp; 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can apply a dose of your poison with this attack. As in, by
spitting on someone. This is a taijutsu attack, though it uses your
ninjutsu damage bonus and can only be parried as if it was a ninjutsu
technique. It inflicts Energy wounds (due to the caustic nature of the
saliva). As usual, this costs 1 Vitality for every Poison Point
utilized during the attack.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Oily Skin )--<br>
Frequently mistaken for sweat by their enemies, Sabechi with this
mutation tend to enjoy trading blows with their opponents, crippling
them the longer the fight goes on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Rather than being an attack, this is activated as a pre-emptive action.
At that point you specify the composition of your poison.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyone who strikes you with an unarmed attack must pass a Resistance
roll&nbsp; or be poisoned.&nbsp; As a Speed 6 action, you can
change the type of poison applied upon contact. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
A new dose of poison is automatically applied to your skin (And
therefore, deducted from your Vit/HP) every time you poison
someone.&nbsp; This can knock you unconscious, but will not reduce
your HP below 0 (and will shut off, if the cost can't be paid).<br>
<br>

### Kirigakure No Sato<br>
Located in the south western part of Water Country, Kirigakure no Sato
has a cool to moderate climate. Being near to the shore and often
fluctuating in temperature, the village is swallowed by fog year round,
leaving it perpetually moist and dreary. Entering Kirigakure, it's hard
to make a quick judgment of its size. Stone buildings loom like ghosts
dressed with sturdy flora disappearing from sight into the hazy
countryside. <br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
After the war, Kiri was one of the first villages to recover. Being an
island, its physical infrastructure remained mostly in tact. The first
order of business was rebuilding the village's military strength.
Previously Kiri had eradicated several clans who tried to overthrow the
Mizukage and council elders. Perhaps it was luck, but some of them
escaped the purge. Many previously exiled or near extinct clans, seeing
Kirigakure weakened, came out of the woodwork and claimed their
footholds, building new and better clan compounds and taking seats on
the Kiri council. Kiri, realizing they couldn't afford to refuse them,
allowed them back - but they live under perpetual observation. Shortly
after, many of the people came to Kiri from the surrounding villages,
having not fared as well through the war. While Water Country is still
hurting for total population, Kiri appears to be bigger and stronger
politically than in the past. Rumors abound of them more or less
bullying local nobles and perhaps even the daimyo, though nobody--on
either side--will confirm that.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
During the recovery after the Fourth Great Shinobi War, Kirigakure
underwent reform. They did away with their chaotic, bloody past and
introduced a new age of military power and structure, adamantly
refusing to risk losing their seat as one of the Five Great Shinobi
Superpowers. Because of this, students who begin to fall behind in the
academy are pushed ever harder; those who can't keep up are cut out,
without second chances. They start training their shinobi at younger
ages than any other village, and their genin graduation happens a year
or two later than most other villages. Should an individual remain out
of work for an extended period of time or fail to meet village
expectations, they're subject to review and the mercy of the Kirigakure
council. <br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Martial Law reigns supreme. In the past Kirigakure's greatest threats
came from within - those days are no&nbsp; more. The village wastes
no time in snuffing out even the hint of rebellion or political
discord. <br>
<br>

<br>
The forces of Kiri can proudly call upon the Hozuki, Kaguya, Niou,
Terumi and Touu clans in their hour of need. There was a time in which
the seven swordsmen were but a faded memory, although that has changed.
The swordsman corps of mist has once again risen to prominence to
become a feared force. Because drunk, crazy,&nbsp; violent island
dudes with swords are dangerous.<br>

## Sword Corps<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp; src='https://i.imgur.com/jmHk3JY.png' <br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
One of Mist's several special operations units, the Swordsman Corps are
trained to be Kirigakure's elite infantry. Militaristic and merciless,
only the students who display an abnormal talent or fascination with
swordsmanship are selected to be trained by the Corps.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Mist's swordsmen may not believe their kenjutsu is superior to ninjutsu
or typical taijutsu; some do, while most admit it's simply a very
specific focus. Most, however, will very adamantly reject the concept
that natural talents or abilities, such as bloodlines, can match their
rigorous training.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
A disproportionate number of the Mizukage's honor guard tend to be
members of the Swordsman Corps.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### Members of the Swordsman Corps begin with 1 less Unique Point.
Because they have no clue.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Blademaster )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Members of the swordsman corps do not put as much effort into training
with their swords as other ninja do into learning the basics of
ninjutsu--they put in more. This rigorous training tends to leave
members of the swordsman corp disproportionately grim, and
exceptionally dangerous.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Precision<br>
Effects:<br>
When using a sword, you use DEX/8 rather than DEX/10 to determine your
bonus to Accuracy. Additionally, when making a sword attack you may
choose to replace your regular accuracy with an accuracy roll (using
1d20 instead of 10 for the base value).<br>
<br>
If you choose to use your physical damage bonus with a sword attack,
instead of your Sword Damage Bonus from the Precision ability (found
directly below this one), you do not receive the benefits of
Blademaster on that attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Precision )--<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Any ninja who uses a weapon seriously knows something about it beyond
;put the pointy end into the other person;. Mist's swordsmen generally
understand their weapons, knowing the importance of a sword being
well-balanced, and just how to cut someone to make the most of their
weapon's momentum.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limiting Attribute: DEX /20, Max 4<br>
&nbsp; &lt;Br&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
You have a special &amp;quot;sword damage bonus&amp;quot; of
DEX/15 (to, as usual, a single decimal point). You may use this in
place of your physical damage bonus whenever wielding a sword, if you
prefer. Each rank beyond the first reduces the divisor by 1, to a
minimum of DEX/12.<br>
<br>
Increases to your Physical Damage Bonus do not affect your Sword Damage
Bonus. However, anything which reduces your PDB (such as many wounds)
will also reduce your SDB.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Silver Flash )--<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Once a sword kata has been perfected, you don't stop practicing it. If
it is a ten-minute kata, and you know every step perfectly, you will do
it in nine minutes, and then in eight. You learn how to not think about
what you're doing, and instead simply do it. You learn to stop being a
person wielding a sword, and become a sword guided by your subconscious.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limiting Attribute: DEX /40<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Br&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Effects: &lt;BR&gt;<br>
Every rank reduces the Base Speed of your sword attacks by 1, but
increases their damage for the purpose of causing wounds by 5%.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Daisho )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Most memebrs of Mist's Swordsman Corps have one sword which is distinct
to them, and they learn to use it like an extension of their own body,
often to the exclusion of other weapons. A select few, however, find
themselves with the need or desire to own more than one. If these
individuals are considered worthwhile, the Corps will allow them to
have another one of Mist's famous swords forged for them.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Technically, &amp;quot;daisho&amp;quot; refers to a paired set
of weapons used by samurai. It's a very precise word, with deep
significance and a great deal of ceremonial importance. Well, at some
point in the past some member of the Swordsman Corps decided to present
themselves as a samurai, and adopted the term to refer to their own
paired weapons. It caught on, because while ninja don't actually know
anything about samurai behavior, it sounds impressive to claim you
follow their ways, and now a &amp;quot;Daisho&amp;quot; among
the swordsman corps refers to any set of weapons an individual
personally values.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Talent<br>
Effects:<br>
This may only be taken after you already have a clan sword (meaning,
you are of chuunin or higher rank). You acquire a second sword, which
follows all the normal rules for a clan sword, designed separately from
your first one. You may take this talent multiple times, acquiring a
new sword each time.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
#### -=[ Clan Swords ]=-<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Upon becoming a chuunin, a Mist swordsman will receive their own,
personalized blade. Most of them will have kept, used, and taken care
of a single sword, usually a katana, from their days in the academy--in
these cases, they usually opt to have that weapon reforged.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Though they don't partake in the forging process, the ninja will be
there the entire time, and it's followed by a ritual consecration, and
a four-day period of solitary meditation in which the shinobi is alone
with only their blade, fasting and subsisting off only just enough
water to stave off dehydration.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The relationship between sword and swordsman is... interesting. Most
swordsmen take care of their blade better than their teammates, and
it's not even considered unusual for them to name and talk to it (if
the sword starts talking back, though, that just means they're crazy).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
There's more to this than lasting effects of the hallucinations from
four days of fasting and partial dehydration. Members of the swordsman
corps always know where their sword is, in terms of distance and
direction. It could be on the other side of the world, and given enough
time, they'd be able to track it down.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Many claim their swords are 'loyal' to them (others just say their
weapons are unique and they're the only ones who know how to use them
properly); and, indeed, a borrowed or stolen sword functions as an
ordinary katana, nothing more, in the hands of anyone but its rightful
owner.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
In the event one of these swords is hopelessly lost (say, tossed to the
bottom of the ocean, or thrown into a volcano) a new one can be forged
for the swordsman, though this is not done lightly; if given the
chance, most would literally fight through hell to get their sword
back. It takes four weeks to obtain a replacement sword, after which
the original will no longer recognize its former owner. A member of the
swordsman corps who accepts a replacement blade when it's in any way
possible to reclaim their old one is viewed with severe disdain by
their fellow swordsmen. (Using a regular katana in the meanwhile,
however, is perfectly acceptable).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Upon reaching Chuunin rank all members of the Swordsman Corps receive
their own weapon automatically. Once you've reached that rank, use the
rules here to customize your personal weapon.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Your sword begins with 20 points which you can spend on it at your
discretion. The first thing for you to do is choose its Structure
features; this is its basic shape and so on. There are 5 primary
characteristics to select here, and each one has a point cost listed
next to it; for example, &amp;quot;(2) Slashing&amp;quot; means
it costs 2 of your 20 points to make your weapon inflict Slashing
damage.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
After selecting all your Structure options, you move on to Features.
Although prices are in the same format, the layout is different.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Features relate to three key components of your weapon: its balance
(how easy it is to handle), its blade (how sharp, and other special
characteristics), and its body (its weight and sturdiness). They are
also divided into three tiers: Bottom, Middle, and Top. To take
features in the Middle tier, you must have spent at least 5 of your
sword customization points in that group; to take features from the Top
tier, you must have spent at least 10 points in that tree.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
For example, if you spent&nbsp; 7 points on Low-tier and 3 points
on Middle-tier features in Balance, you could take the top-tier Balance
features. You would still be restricted to Low-tier Blade and Body
features, unless you also spent enough points in those trees.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You must spend at least 1 point in one of the three primary trees of
Features. There are also Special Features, which have two differences
from regular features. The first, they only have Bottom and Middle
tiers. The second, they will not determine your sword's number of
damage dice.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Structure<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
1. Damage Type<br>
Every weapon must have at least one damage type. If it's both, you can
decide whether to deal slashing or piercing damage each time you
attack, and the weapon can be used with Slashing- or Piercing-only
moves (though in that case it deals only the type of damage allowed by
the technique).<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Slashing<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Piercing<br>
<br>
2. Size<br>
A weapon may have only one size. Size determines both which jutsu and
abilities it functions with, as well as the number of damage dice it
rolls.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(0) Normal: 6d_ damage<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3) Small: 4d_ damage<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) Large: 8d_ damage<br>
<br>
3. Two-Handed?<br>
Only Large weapons may be two-handed. If a weapon is two-handed, it
can't be used one-handed unless you have the Monkey Grip ability. You
may only choose one of these options.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(0) One-Handed<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(4) Two-Handed<br>
<br>
4. Number<br>
Some swordsmen have more than one weapon. The Dual tag does not
actually grant you an additional sword, just means your weapon is
optimized for dual-wielding (as per the ability). If you take Paired,
you get a second weapon which has 13 points to spend normally, and may
not take Paired itself.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) Dual<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(5) Paired<br>
<br>
5. Damage<br>
Not something you spend points on, this time! Of the three primary
feature sets below (Quick, Steady, and Strong), determine which one you
have the most points in. If there's a tie, choose one. That determines
your sword's Speed, Stamina cost, and die size.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Balance: Speed 10, Stamina
8, _d6 damage<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blade: Speed 12, Stamina 10,
_d10 damage<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Body: Speed 15, Stamina 14,
_d12 damage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
```<br>

2. Features<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Balance ]=-<br>
<br>
###### Bottom:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) +2 Bleed, -1 die of
damage. Your sword must deal at least 1d_ damage. This status effect is
automatically&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;applied if the sword does damage.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) If you spend AP on a
sword attack, and miss, half the AP spent (rounded down) is refunded.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Your sword deals +1d_
damage, to a maximum of +4d_.<br>
&nbsp; &lt;Br&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
###### Middle:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) -1 base Speed, maximum
of -2.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) +1 Parry, to a maximum
of +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Top:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Your Parry has its base
Speed reduced by 1. This can only be taken once.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) The weapon may be held
with one less hand than normal. This allows a two-handed weapon to be
one-handed without difficulty (though does mean it loses is two-handed
damage bonus). A weapon that requires &amp;quot;no
hands&amp;quot; can be strapped to your body somehow.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Blade ]=-<br>
<br>
###### &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bottom:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Your sword's damage is
increased by 10% for the purposes of determining wounds; this can be
taken up to 5 times.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Your sword attacks have
their damage bonus increased by 1, but their Accuracy decreased by 1 as
well.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Your sword's die size is
increased by 2, to a maximum of _d20.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Br&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
###### Middle:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Attempting to parry your
sword has a -1 penalty, to a maximum of -3.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Your sword deals three
more dice of damage but has its Stamina cost increased by 4.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Top:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Your sword deals another
STR/20 dice of damage, but has its Stamina cost increased by the number
of dice added this way.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Your weapon's dice
become .extra(die size-2). This can be purchased repeatedly, each time
lowering the .extra value by 1 (from .extra(10) to .extra(9), then
.extra(8), and so on).<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Body ]=-<br>
###### Bottom:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) You have a +1 bonus to
rolls made to disarm an opponent's weapon, and a +1 bonus to any of
your defenses against being disarmed. Your sword's base Speed is
increased by 1.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) If you block while
holding your sword, you gain a DR equal to your Sword Damage Bonus;
this is multiplied by the number of times you've taken this feature,
and doubled if used with the mid-tier Weapon Block ability.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Your sword gains a Stun
1, to a maximum of Stun 4.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Middle:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Weapon Block: While
wielding your sword, you can block weapon attacks as a Speed 4
Interrupt.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) You may declare when you
make your attack that you are reducing its damage by 50%. If it hits,
it gains a Stun of (damage dealt)/50. If you purchase this feature a
second time, you reduce your damage by only 25%. It cannot be taken
more than twice. This adds to the low-tier Stun effect if you have it.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Anyone attempting to
parry your sword does so at a -1 penalty. This can be taken up to 4
times.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Top:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) While blocking, you can
declare Block as your defense against a disarm attempt. This allows you
to use your normal Accuracy value, or make an accuracy roll, against
the disarm attempt, with a +5 bonus (in addition to all other Steady
bonuses).<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Special Features<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
##### -=[ Small ]=-<br>
###### Bottom:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) Your sword has +1
Accuracy, but -0.5 to your damage bonus. This has a maximum of +2 / -1.0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Someone trying to parry
your sword with a weapon does so as if your attack's Speed was 1 lower.

### Terumi<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp;
src='https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/narutofanon/images/f/f8/Lava_Explosion.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20130410181603'
<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
One of the few clans in Kirigakure that was never victim of the
extensive bloodline purges in that village's pasts, the Terumi clan
came about only after they had concluded. Most of the clan is descended
directly from the Fifth Mizukage, from whom they take their name.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Typically red-haired and slender, the Terumi have a slightly
exaggerated, but ultimately accurate, reputation for being hot-headed
and tending to react strongly (and often violently) to comments about
issues they find sensitive. Whether what offended them was something a
person actually said, or a simple mishearing on their part, doesn't
seem to matter very much.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Surprisingly for such a relatively new clan, the Terumi have wound up
in a position of lore-keepers for the village. Mist's largest library,
and the vast majority of its historical records, are managed by the
clan.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Terumi begin with Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Water. They have
Elemental Affinity for Futton, which includes Katon and Suiton.<br>
<br>

&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Futton - Boil Release )--<br>
Combining fire- and water-natured chakra produces the somewhat
inaccurately-named Boil Release; not all Futton techniques necessarily
use boiling water. Some converted Katon instead manifest as a heated,
often high-speed blast of corrosive mist.<br>
<br>
Any Suiton or Katon technique may be converted into Futton, with the
following effects:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;+5 Chakra cost.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Futton always deals Energy
damage.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Optionally, Katon techniques
may use up to half their Chakra cost in gallons of water.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Katon techniques which don't
utilize water instead manifest as corrosive steam. When this condenses
(after the technique is resolved), it adds 1/5 of the move's Chakra
cost in gallons of water to the battlefield.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You may choose to boil off
(remove from battle) up to half the gallons of water used in a
technique. Each gallon 'destroyed' this way increases the technique's
damage by 5%.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blocking Futton reduces its
damage normally. However, its damage for the purpose of inflicting
wounds is based off its unreduced damage. The same applies to partial
defense.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Futton cannot inflict
Ignite. Instead, Futton techniques deal 5% more damage per point of
Ignite they would inflict.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suiton techniques converted
to Futton gain Burns equal to their Chakra cost divided by 5.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Futton is strong against
Katon and Fuuton, but weak to Doton.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Boil )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Channeling your chakra into an impending water-based attack, you boil
it harmlessly away before it reaches you.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5 + X/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: X<br>
&lt;Br&gt;Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
This can be used as a defensive Interrupt against any Suiton ninjutsu
which requires gallons to be used. Make an Accuracy roll, with (CHA)/10
as a bonus. X is the amount of gallons used in the jutsu you're
interrupting. If successful, the technique fails, and the gallons of
water used in it are destroyed.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
##### --( Sekai ni Tokeru - Dissolving World )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The Terumi ability to boil water and alter the pH of steam taken to a
logical extreme, this boils all water within a broad radius within
seconds, flooding the area with a rising high-temperature vapor.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Futton Ninjutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35 + X/5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 22<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
This destroys up to your CHA in gallons of water. Water present on the
battlefield will be boiled off first, and then water used in jutsu with
upkeeps. It's centered on you, and has an Area of 50 or up to X, with X
being the number of gallons boiled, whichever is higher.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;It does X*(ninjutsu damage bonus) damage to anyone
caught inside the area. As is normal for a Futton technique, blocking
and partial defense will not decrease the damage from its wounds.<br>

### Touu<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp;
src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/narutoff/images/a/a9/Cold_Shower.png/revision/latest?cb=20141226073010'
<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The Hidden Mist, and Water Country in general, has a dark past it would
very much like to forget. And, while the Touu would just as much like
for it to never have happened, they in many ways are symbolic of that
dark, bloody past.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
When the people of Water Country embarked on their genocide against
bloodlines, they were remarkably successful. Shinobi within Kirigakure
who possessed distinctive kekkei genkai were suddenly demonized by
their peers, and would end up being 'killed in action' on routine
missions or simply vanish. Several bloodlines vanished forever.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The Touu did not, despite being the proverbial poster children for
'powerful, dangerous bloodlines'. Their powers manifested at a very
young age, and could be used even without ninja training. They weren't
arrogant, but they were special, and that was enough for them to be
feared, hated, and ultimately all but wiped out in an orgy of
irrational hate and violence.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Decades later, Kirigakure found itself in an awkward position: it
wanted to get as many of those bloodlines back as they could, but most
shinobi with kekkei genkai were fearful and resentful of the village,
at best, and guilt and old hatreds were slow to die down.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The Touu bloodline was forever diminished. The once-proud clan that had
faithfully and efficiently served its village was no more; the village
was left gathering up tattered shreds and trying to patch them back
together, which all the success of a child trying to repair a torn-up
work of art before their parents got home. Literally dozens of secret
techniques were lost forever.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The Touu of the current generation are few in number, and tend to be
cold, aloof, and perhaps a touch more prideful than is warranted. The
wholesale genocide of your ancestors by the ancestors of your peers, at
the behest of the organization you work for and the country you serve,
is a little hard to get over. If people criticize them for being
arrogant and thinking themselves better or different than everyone
else... well, those criticisms always have an undertone of guilt to
them. It's just as hard for everyone else to wash away that inherited
shame as it is for the Touu to forget the taste of betrayal at the
hands of those they served.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Touu begin with Elemental Aptitudes for Water and Wind. They have an
Elemental Affinity for Hyouton, which includes Suiton and Fuuton.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>

&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Hyouton - Ice Release )--<br>
Touu have the ability to use one of the coveted advanced chakra
natures: ice release, combined the elements of water and wind. Ice
release combined the flexibility of water with the penetrating power of
wind.<br>
<br>
You may convert any Suiton or Fuuton technique into a Hyouton
technique, with the following effects:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; +5 Chakra cost.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Blocking reduces the damage from Hyouton
techniques by only 25%.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Unless an individual jutsu specifies otherwise,
Hyouton inflicts Piercing wounds. Hyouton's damage for the purpose of
wounding is considered 25% higher, which stacks additively with any
existing increases on converted jutsu (50%+25% = 75%).<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Fuuton converted into Hyouton may not be used
with a fan, and gains a gallons of water requirement equal to half its
chakra cost.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Any time someone is hit by a Hyouton technique,
they suffer an immobilization penalty due to ice crystalizing on them
and their muscles being numbed. This penalty is -1 for E-rank
techniques, -2 for D-ranks, -3 for C-ranks, -4 for B-ranks, and -5 for
A-ranks. This penalty fades at a rate of 1 per 10 IC.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Hyouton is weak against Katon, and strong
against Doton and Suiton.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Suitenhoufukyuu - Water Sky Convergence )--<br>
Often considered the mark of the Touu bloodline, even moreso than their
ability to use ice release ninjutsu. All members of the bloodline, even
ones without ninja training, exhibit from a young age the ability to
mentally control water. They can lift it off the ground, cause it to
float between their hands, and even freeze it with a thought (or,
conversely, liquify ice).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
For a child, this is limited to what's nearby, and what they can see;
for a skilled ninja, they can actually sense the presence of
significant bodies of water (this does not include human beings or
large animals).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You may use any water scattered about the battlefield to fuel your
Suiton or Hyouton techniques, as if you'd performed the Water Gathering
Technique. This does not allow you to seize control of someone else's
water or techniques; if it's in a container, or is infused with
someone's chakra, it's off limits.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You may take a Speed X action, with a Chakra cost of 5+2*X, to freeze
or liquify (CHA/30, minimum 1)*X gallons of water on the battlefield.
Ice may not be used in Suiton techniques; it can, however, be used to
perform Hyouton (including Suiton jutsu which you have converted into
Hyouton).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You can perform Suiton (but not Hyouton) jutsu without handseals, by
adding (the base Seal Speed - CHA/10)/2, rounded up, to the action's
base Speed. Normal alterations to Seal Speed (such as from Ninjutsu
Specialist) do not apply to this ability.<br>

##### --( Hijutsu: Sensatsu Suishou - Secret Technique: Thousand Flying
Water Needles )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Water is gathered from the air, and then formed into dozens or hundreds
(but 'thousand' sounds far more impressive) of long, levitating
needles. Those needles are then directed a single target at high
speeds; the needles nearly surround the foe, making evasion especially
difficult.<br>
<br>
Note that this is a Suiton technique, and as such can be converted to
Hyouton.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Up to (CHA/8)d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: CHA/3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: 2 gallons of water per 1d10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique's damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of
inflicting wounds, and it always inflicts Piercing wounds. If it wounds
an enemy, it also applies one wound of the next-lower rank<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Located on the outskirts of Mist village, the Hozuki have been
gradually growing in power as a clan. Serving as the guardians and
peacekeepers (or 'peacekeepers') of the village, the Hozuki have
adapted well to Mist's militarization.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Their clan's unique talents also make them excellently suited for
ambushes and 'enforcement' operations; should things turn against their
favor, the ability to liquify oneself entirely allows them many options
to retreat, regroup, and return with overwhelming enforcements.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Within Kirigakure, everyone knows that the Hozuki can turn into water,
but few outside the clan truly understand that ability's limits.
Murmuring of dissent become a terrifying prospect when one imagines
that every puddle or drain pipe could contain a Hozuki listening in.<br>

##### --( Suika no Jutsu - Hydration Technique )--<br>
The Hozuki clan's pride is the ability to liquify their entire entire
body, from bones to organs to hair, turning into living water. Although
they normally maintain a humanoid form, there is nothing preventing
them from turning into a puddle and slipping under a door or escaping
down a drain--though they lose their ability to perceive their
surroundings if they don't keep at least their head intact.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: Special<br>
<br>
Effects:&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Liquifying is a Speed 5 Interrupt (which does not require a roll to
succeed), while solidifying is a Speed 0 action. While in water form,
the following effects are applied:<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You take only 25% damage from Suiton, and 50%
from Katon.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You cannot block Doton or Raiton.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You take double damage from Raiton, and when
hit, you are automatically affected by a Stun 5.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You are immune to physical attacks and medical
ninjutsu.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You are immune to, and do not suffer the
penalties of existing, Wounds.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You can breath underwater.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Your Strength damage bonus is set to 0.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You cannot be grappled (or grapple other
people), and ignore immobilization penalties and effects which work by
restraining or caging you.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You always have an additional 20 gallons of
water to use with Suiton jutsu, which nobody else may access. If you
figure out why, you get a cookie. This water is never used up, or
considered to be added to the battlefield.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; You cannot be burnt, poisoned, or ignited, and
ignore the effects of those statuses while in liquid form; their
durations still decrease normally (and Ignite automatically ends).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You may not liquify (though you can still solidify) if you are
suffering from a Paralysis effect which was caused by a Raiton jutsu.
If incapacitated while liquified you revert to a semi-solid,
translucent gel-like form. In this state you do not heal at all unless
immersed in water, at which point you begin recovering normally.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Masakana Namiochiru - Demon Fish Wave Crash )--<br>
Pulling in water from all around you and extending your chakra from
your watery form into it all, you turn a mass of animate water with a
vague outline of yourself at the center. Despite the jutsu's name, the
water constantly tends to change shape and features, but most who see
it can swear they see something demonic formed. This not only offers
protection to the user, but also allows them to come crashing down upon
their enemies as well.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Suika no Jutsu active<br>
Effects: <br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You absorb up to CHA/2 gallons of water into yourself. In this form you
do not take extra damage from Raiton, and are not stunned by it. You
may use the water you've absorbed into yourself in Suiton ninjutsu
without first performing water-gathering. You may not use any regular
taijutsu while in this form, though you get +Gallons/10 to your
physical damage bonus (rather than reducing it to 0, as would be normal
for Suika), and a 'shield' of Gallons*15 HP that takes damage before
your own vitality or HP (You lose the gallons when you lose this HP).
The only Taijutsu you may actually use in this form is as follows:<br>
<br>
##### Crashing Tsunami<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Suiton Taijutsu<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 20<br>

&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
Effects:<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
You may move up to CHA/2 yards when you use this attack, and you may
collect up to CHA/10 additional gallons into yourself during this
movement, assuming they are present on the battlefield, but not above
your maximum amount.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Suiton: Gosuiwan no Jutsu - Water Release: Great Water Arm
Technique )--<br>
Putting their hydration technique to practical, but less-extreme use, a
Hozuki can force moisture into a single limb (typically an arm) and
give themselves what amounts to hydraulic muscles. The difficulty of
this technique comes from how essential it is to properly control the
distribution of water throughout the body. Used properly, this gives
superhuman strength.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank B<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20 + 2 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: X /2<br>
Effects:<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This increases your physical damage bonus by X, but gives you a -2
penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls due to being put off-balance by your
enlarged limb(s). X has a maximum of CHA/20. This extreme strength is
particularly useful for punching down doors or walls which are
insufficiently reinforced. Notably, this cannot be used when Suika no
Jutsu is active.<br>

&lt;img <br>
&nbsp; src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rvyrVe28xCw/maxresdefault.jpg' <br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
The Niou clan possesses one of the most coveted techniques in the
shinobi world: invisibility. Despite that, they've avoided becoming
famous. There are very few Niou; rather than trying to generate a
reputation that would have shinobi around the world terrified of their
prowess, they downplay and obfuscate their abilities.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Their 'invisibility' is most frequently dismissed as more Mist ninja
trickery, hiding behind veils of chakra-enhanced fog and ninjutsu. The
Niou are happy to keep things that way, and their village quietly
encourages this subterfuge. Even within Kirigakure, the Niou are few
enough in number to be passed off as just a large extended family, not
an actual ninja clan.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Niou tend to prefer to adopt in to their clan, and many of these
orphans keep their original name, rather than take the clan's. They may
pride themselves on membership, but possessing a different last name
makes it that much harder for another shinobi to connect the dots.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Despite their outward appearance of being largely disconnected, Niou
tend to have a close-knit companionship with each other, a mutual
respect that transcends personal grudges. They are raised to be quietly
but firmly loyal to their clan and village, and to prefer reserved
confidence over boastful ambition.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Niou frequently gather together to brag of their exploits to one
another, simply to avoid doing so to other members of the village, who
may not fully understand their invisibility technique--everybody likes
to brag, after all.<br>

<br>
The pride of the Niou clan, and their most closely guarded secret: this
wraps the user in a layer of chakra, and projects their surroundings
across their skin. A slight distortion is the only indication that
anything is out of the ordinary, the technique even providing the
illusion of distance.<br>

&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Effects:<br>
You become invisible. While invisible, you may Hide at will, with a +5
bonus; while hidden, you are always considered to be one Stealth
category higher than you actually are. When making a Stealth roll, or
an Espionage roll to be unnoticed (such as pilfering something, or
picking a pocket) you roll 2d20.takeHighest(1) instead of 1d20. Those
Espionage rolls also receive a +5 bonus.<br>
<br>
Your dodge rolls while invisible receive a similar benefit: you roll
2d20.takeHighest(1) rather than 1d20. This doesn't apply to other
defenses, or against area-of-effect techniques.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Maboroshi no Jutsu - Phantom Technique )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You project your chakra over another person, granting them invisibility
as well. This requires you to make physical contact with them when it's
first applied, and they must remain within (your CHA)/2 yards for its
effects to persist.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Base Cost: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 5&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can conceal one additional person, or person-sized object, with
Genshin no Jutsu per rank. This does require Genshin be active on
yourself, and each additional person concealed this way increases its
upkeep by 3. People and items concealed this way use your stealth in
place of their own; if you're hiding a group, you make only a single
Stealth roll for the entire group.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Meimei Arashi - Invisible Tempest )--<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Wrapping a weapon or held object in your chakra-induced veil of
invisibility is easy; unfortunately, that does not extend to thrown
weapons, as their invisibility comes to an end as soon as they leave
your grasp. This technique exists specifically to patch that hole in
the Niou's invisibility: it allows you to veil one or more thrown
weapons in your chakra, keeping them unseen until they've struck their
target.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Genshin no Jutsu
active&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This supplements a throwing or multi-throwing attack by making it an
automatic surprise attack. Its Chakra cost is equal to the Stamina cost
of the attack being used. If used from hiding, this reduces your
Stealth TN by only 2 each time it's used.<br>

### Kaguya<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp;

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
Originally, the Kaguya clan was not much more than a bunch of
blood-thirsty, barbaric warriors brought into Kirigakure for their
ferocity in battle. Following a failed coup d'etat against the village,
the clan was virtually wiped out--for nearly a generation, in fact, it
was believed that they had become extinct.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
The re-emergence of the Kaguya clan was discovered by one of Mist's
hunter-nin, capturing a renegade ninja who had an unidentifiable body
composition.&nbsp; Mist 'negotiated' their return to the village,
and within a few generations the Kaguya clan had begun its rise to
prominence.&nbsp; They were given their own compound and priority
in missions, and became, once again, the most feared clan within
Kirigakure.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Along with a kekkai genkai that is touted as the ultimate taijutsu
ability, Kaguya are feared for their bloodlust and their refusal to
surrender.&nbsp; They will often refuse to stop fighting against
overwhelming odds, preferring a bloody death to a peaceful surrender
and a long life.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Mindful of the Kaguya's past betrayal, all of the perks given to the
clan came with restrictions.&nbsp; All Kaguya are branded at a
young age with two dots just above their eyebrows, in the center of
their forehead.&nbsp; While not especially well known by those
outside of Kirigakure, within the village it is a marking that commands
respect by most, fear by many, and suspicion by a few. Many Kaguya
shave their eyebrows as well; it's something of a clan tradition, but
by no means enforced.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
While there are no official restrictions, in practice the ranks and
positions of members of the Kaguya clan are closely monitored. It
speaks volumes that there has yet to be a Kaguya hunter-nin. They're
respected, but not trusted.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### Kaguya begin with 1 less Unique Point. Because they have a bone
to pick.<br>

<br>
#### -=[ Abilities ]=-<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Shikotsumyaku - Dead Bone Pulse )--<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The proper name of the Kaguya clan's advanced bloodline, this gives
them the ability to manipulate their skeletal structure by infusing it
with chakra. The primary capability is allowing the user to induce
rapid, focused bone growth at will. Truly powerful Kaguya were dreaded
as having indestructible bodies.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 7<br>
Effects:<br>
You acquire any one Skeletal Modification.<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Shitaikotsu Rensa - Corpse Bone Chain )--<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Much like Kaguya themselves in a battle, their bloodline seems to grow
stronger over time, with no apparent upward limit. That a Kaguya's
power grows exponentially when compared to that of their peers is one
of the factors that makes them so valuable to Mist--and so carefully
watched.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ability<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Scale: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Limit: Max Willpower<br>
&lt;Br&gt;Effects:<br>
Whenever you acquire a Skeletal Modification, from any source, you may
increase your Stamina penalty by 2 and gain any other Skeletal
Modification (which does not have to be one that technique could
normally provide). This may be used a number of times per battle equal
to your ranks in this ability.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Teshi Sendan - Ten-Finger Drilling Bullets )--<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
You can fire the bones of your fingertips at opponents. They fly faster
than most weapons, and rotate quickly enough to literally drill through
most defenses before losing their momentum.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 5 + 2 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Xd10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10+RES/10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You fire X projectiles, up to a maximum of 10; your damage bonus for
this attack is increased by 0.25 per projectile. This attack deals
Piercing damage and ignores armor. For the purposes of defending
against Teshi Sendan it is considered a multi-throw, though it is not
subject to other multi-throw rules.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Teshi Sendan's damage is increased by X*10% for the purposes of dealing
wounds. Regardless of its actual Speed, it uses X as its Speed for the
purposes of determining damage. Any defenses with a set amount of HP
(such as Earth Shore Return) take double damage from Teshi Sendan.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You may take Weapon Focus: Teshi Sendan, which increases its Chakra
cost appropriately (since Teshi Sendan does not have a Stamina cost).<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Skeletal Modifications:<br>
Osteogensis<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Tsubaki no Mai - Dance of the Camellia )--<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
By manipulating their skeleton, Kaguya are able to extrude weapons made
of bone through their flesh, pulling them out the rest of the way and
using them in combat. Despite being bones, these are stronger than iron.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You can create any non-Large weapon from the Equipment section of the
PHB, other than bows (arrows are fine). If you wish, you may 'draw'
these weapons as part of this action, simply discard them, or keep them
partially extended from your skeleton, ready to be 'drawn' whenever you
wish. If you are creating a weapon with the 'Dual' property, you can
create two of them with only one use of this technique, though doing so
increases its Chakra cost by 5.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the hands of anyone but a Kaguya these have a -3 Accuracy penalty.
Your own bone weapons have a +2 bonus to their Accuracy when you are
using them. Other Kaguya using your weapons receive no penalty or bonus.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Skeletal Modifications:<br>
Blades, Spurs, Osteogenesis, Skeletal Realignment<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Karamatsu no Mai - Dance of the Larch )--<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This technique creates razor-sharp bone spikes all over the user's
body, branching off from the existing skeletal structure. These bones
can stop attacks on their own, or if necessary the user can spin in
place, turning themselves and the area around them into a veritable
death trap.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank D<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 22<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is a melee-range parry with a +1 bonus per rank of Bone Spurs you
have active. If successful, they also take damage from your Spurs as if
they had struck you, plus your damage bonus multiplied by this
technique's speed. This can not deal damage against a Large weapon
attack.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Skeletal Modifications:<br>
Blades, Spurs<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Yanagi no Mai - Dance of the Willow )--<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
A multitude of bones protrude from the body, most commonly along the
joints of the shoulders, elbows and knees, creating sharp spikes that
extend outward in several directions, turning their entire body into a
weapon.&nbsp; Thereafter, the user can focus on evasion and
counterattacking, with minimal movement required to strike at anyone
who comes near.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
While maintaining Dance of the Willow's Upkeep, you may spend 4 AP to
attack anyone in melee range using your bones. By raising the cost to 6
AP you improve this attack to target everyone in melee range with you.
You may attack with Dance of the Willow at most once every 10 IC, and
it is always considered to be a surprise attack.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
This is treated as a Speed 8 action, though it does not allow you to
move as part of the attack; you do not delay your next action because
of this, but that Speed is used to determine viable defenses and damage
bonus. You can spend additional AP to lower the effective Speed
further. Parrying Dance of the Willow reduces its damage by half and
prevents it from inflicting wounds, rather than defending against it
fully.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You acquire a Skeletal Modification every time you spend AP to activate
Dance of the Willow, but not when you first use the jutsu and pay its
chakra cost.<br>

<br>
##### --( Tessenka no Mai - Dance of the Clematis )--<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Through the use of Shikotsumyaku, the Kaguya creates a bone weapon from
one of the central bones of the body (typically the femur or the
spine), which is then augmented further. The resulting weapon is both
stronger and lighter than any metal, making it positively devastating
in the hands of a skilled Kaguya.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This creates a Large Piercing weapon, which can use both Sword and
Polearm abilities and techniques. Attacking is a Stamina 25, Speed 16
action. It deals 1d12 damage per Skeletal Modification you have, and
you may take the Weapon Focus ability for this weapon. For each rank in
certain skeletal modifications, its effects are modified as follows.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Armor: -1 base Speed<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Blades: Damage is considered 5% higher for determining wounds<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Spurs: +1 Accuracy<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Osteogenesis: -2 Stamina cost<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Skeletal Modifications:<br>
Any<br>
<br>
<br>
##### --( Sawarabi no Mai - Dance of the Seedling Fern )--<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
The pinnacle of the Kaguya clan's techniques, this creates a countless
number of bone spires around the user, creating an entire field made
from their bones which they can shape as they desire.&nbsp; The
field entraps and potentially skewers everyone caught in it, and the
Kaguya can instantly travel from one bone to another by melding in and
out of them.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Type: Taijutsu, Rank C<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 1d12 per Skeletal Modification<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: Physical damage bonus *5 yards<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may instantly move anywhere in the radius as a Speed 0 action.
Using this, you can increase the Speed of any action by 2 to make it a
Surprise Attack. By melding into and out of the bones you can remove
any Immobilization penalty (excluding those due to poison, genjutsu,
etc.) as a Speed 4 action. While inside your bone field, you can
attempt to Hide. When you hide, you begin at Stealth 2.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
If someone attempts to escape the bone field, you may automatically
Interrupt their action with any melee-range attack of Speed 10 or less
by moving to them and attacking; if they are in Stealth when they
attempt to do so, you automatically locate them in time to intercept.
If you hit, this knocks them half of the way back towards the center of
the field.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
When used, this effectively destroys any other terrain-based effects
(such as mud on the ground). Inside the field, the Kaguya has a +5
bonus to Awareness. If this technique is used again when already inside
its radius, the two fields overlap and combine; nobody already in the
field will be damaged again; and the cost is halved, after applying
Osteogenesis' reductions.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sawarabi no Mai deals Piercing damage. Even if someone dodges Sawarabi
no Mai, they do not escape its area; they simply avoid being skewered
by spikes of bone erupting from the ground.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
After a few hours the bones will grow brittle as the chakra dissipates
and begin crumbling. Within a day there will be nothing left but dust
and bone chips.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Skeletal Modifications:<br>
Any two.<br>

<br>
#### -=[ Skeletal Modifications ]=-<br>
<br>
As the Kaguya fight, their skeletal structure becomes increasingly
better-adapted for combat. Every time you use one of your clan jutsu,
you gain one of the following modifications. You can apply them
repeatedly, their effects stacking additively.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Additionally, every time you suffer a Wound you gain a skeletal
modification of your choice.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
If you wish, you may suppress activation of these modifications.
Suppressing any or all of your skeletal modifications is a Speed 0
action. Regardless, once combat has ended these effects all fade within
an hour; bones retract into your body, and so forth.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### [ Armor ]<br>
You extend your bones to cover your vital regions, forming broad,
flexible plates. This gives you a damage reduction of (RES)/5, and can
be applied up to 5 times.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
#### [ Blades]<br>
Numerous spikes and blades of hardened bone protrude from your body in
combat-useful ways, such as from your knees, extending past your hands,
and so forth. This increases your damage bonus by 0.25 for unarmed
taijutsu and weapons created by Dance of the Camellia, or 0.5 for clan
jutsu (including Dance of the Clematis' weapon), each time it's
applied. There is no limit to how many ranks of bone blades you may
apply.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### [ Spurs ]<br>
Small shards and lengthier spikes of bones gradually cover your body,
protruding from beneath your skin and injurying anyone foolish enough
to strike you. Anyone who attacks you in melee range, including with
any weapons of less than Large size, takes (your RES)/5 damage if they
hit. This damage is also dealt any time they use a Grapple Jutsu
against you. You can apply this up to 5 times.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### [ Osteogenesis ]<br>
The more a Kaguya fights, the easier it becomes for them to do so.
Every application of this modification reduces the Chakra costs of your
clan jutsu by 2. You can apply this up to 5 times.<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### [ Skeletal Realignment ]<br>
You recover from any one wound of your choice which involves your
bones, such as broken ribs.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Sheathe Weapon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Discard Weapon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Retrieve Weapon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Disarm<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Obtaining Equipment<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ninja in the Naruto universe have an advantage which real ninja lacked:
namely, magical chakra-based powers that let them perform superhuman
physical feats, stand on water, and breathe fire.<br>
<br>
Even so, a wise ninja, magical or not, will equip themselves with a
wide variety of tools. True, you could create a thick bank of fog
instead of throwing down a smoke bomb--but that smoke bomb's faster,
and less taxing.<br>
<br>
Every piece of equipment has a cost in Ryo, the world's most
commonly-used currency. You can get Ryo in two primary ways, the Money:
Requisition and Money: Savings abilities.<br>
<br>
Items bought with Requisition can be traded in and replaced whenever
you visit your village. Items bought with Savings are yours forever,
for better or worse; if you lose them, they won't be replaced.<br>
<br>
<br>
Items can be divided into two broad categories: Consumable and
non-consumable.<br>
<br>
Consumable items are gone once you use them once. These are things like
smoke bombs, poisons, and explosives. Used-up consumables can be
restocked when you get back to your village, if they were bought with
Requisition. It is generally unwise to purchase consumables with
Savings; if you do, once you use them they are gone forever.<br>
<br>
Non-consumable items can be broken, destroyed, or lost, but usually
aren't. These are things like ropes, weapons, and lockpicks.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Weapon-Specific Actions<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Draw Weapon (Speed 5)<br>
Weapons are typically carried attached to one's person somehow; swords
have sheathes, a pair of tonfa might be tucked through belt holsters, a
fan could be strapped across your back, and so forth.<br>
<br>
Drawing a weapon is retrieving it from wherever you have it stored and
placing it in your hands. At this point you can use it to attack,
parry, or whatever else you please, the downside being that your hands
aren't free for, say, handseals. You may also draw a weapon at the
start of combat (when you roll initiative), without taking an action to
do so. If you wish, you can draw two weapons as a single Speed 5 action.<br>
<br>
Note that you only needed to Draw weapons you intend to hold and use in
melee. This Speed to attack with thrown or multi-thrown weapons
includes the time needed to retrieve them from holsters.<br>
<br>
Be aware: While holding one or more weapons, you can still make basic
unarmed attacks. You cannot, however, use Unarmed or Combo jutsu.
Grappling is still possible as long as you have at least one hand free.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Sheathe Weapon (Speed 5)<br>
You put a weapon you're holding away, in some secure fashion. If you're
holding two weapons, you can put them both away at the same time.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Discard Weapon (Speed 1, or Speed +2)<br>
You drop or toss aside a weapon. Done normally, this is a Speed 1
action. However, it may also be used alongside an Interrupt (such as a
defensive ninjutsu technique) by increasing that action's Speed (after
AP reductions) by 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Retrieve Weapon (Speed 5)<br>
You pick up a weapon on the ground. This can be your weapon, or someone
else's, as long as nobody's currently holding it. You can only pick up
one melee weapon at a time with this action, and must be able to
physically reach it (which may require you to move first).<br>
<br>
You can also pick up DEX/10 used throwing weapons and holster them
appropriately.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp; Disarm (Weapon's Speed +4)<br>
You use a weapon you're holding to knock an enemy's out of their grasp,
usually by hitting it at such an angle, and with enough force, that it
becomes physically impossible for them to hold onto it.<br>
<br>
This is a basic weapon attack that does no damage, but if it hits you
knock their weapon STR/10 yards in any direction (if straight up, the
weapon lands at their feet but cannot be retrieved for STR/10 IC).
Trying to Parry a Disarm attempt has a -3 penalty.<br>
<br>
Small weapons cannot disarm Large weapons, and Large weapons lack the
finesse to be used to disarm at all.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Tonfa<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; h. Trench Knives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Umbrella<br>
<br>
Next to a weapon's name are various characteristics of the weapon,
useful for determining what kind of wounds it inflicts and what jutsu
it may be used with.<br>
<br>
Of particular note is the &amp;quot;Two-Handed&amp;quot;
descriptor, meaning the weapon in question may only be used by holding
it in both hands. When being used two-handed, the weapon increases its
user's Damage Bonus by 50%.<br>
<br>
The multiplication from two-handed weapons does not apply to the damage
bonus increase from the Weapon Focus ability, or any ninjutsu which
temporarily increase your damage bonus.<br>

# 1. Swords<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Katana (Slashing)<br>
The traditional samurai sword, with a slightly curved blade and wavy
design along the edge due to its forging.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 150<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 8d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 13<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: +2 to parry swords<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Ninja-to (Piercing)<br>
A small, light-weight straight-bladed sword with a traditionally
square-shaped handguard, the ninja-to is, as its name may suggest,
favored by shinobi.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 9<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 7<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Drawing and sheathing a ninja-to is a
Speed 2 action.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Nodachi (Large, Slashing, One- or Two-Handed)<br>
The largest practical weapon, a nodachi is is designed for use as a
two-handed weapon. Ninja, however, have the brute strength necessary to
use them one-handed, admittedly with some loss of efficacy. Nodachi
range as great as four feet in length.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 200<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Anyone attempting to parry a Nodachi
has a -2 penalty; however, when attempting to parry using a Nodachi,
your accuracy roll suffers a -3 penalty, and the Parry action's base
Speed is raised to 4.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Tanto (Small, Piercing)<br>
A straight-bladed dagger, usually double-edged, between six and twelve
inches long. Good for stabbing people! Popular among reasonably wealthy
civilians for purposes of self-defense.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 3d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Ignores armor.<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e.&nbsp; Wakizashi (Small, Slashing)<br>
Among samurai, this is the traditional partner of the katana. The
wakizashi has a blade about a foot and a half long. It's a relatively
small sword, which makes it easier for ninja to conceal.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 75<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 11<br>

&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
#### f.&nbsp; Zanbato (Large, Slashing, Two-Handed)<br>
An enormous sword with a hilt over a foot long, and a blade more than
four times longer than that, in traditional militaries the zanbato is
an anti-cavalry weapon. Ninja, however, are hardly deterred by such
impracticality.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 250<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 8d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Delay 2. If you have 80 or higher STR
you may increase the damage by 6d12, by raising its Stamina cost to 20.
If using a Zanbato to parry, the Parry action's base Speed is 4.<br>

====================<br>
# 2. Polearms<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Bo Staff&nbsp; (Blunt, Two-Handed)<br>
A weapon which sees more use in martial arts than among ninja, the bo
staff is traditionally six feet long, though ninja scale their staves
to their users. The bo is, essentially, a hard wooden pole, sometimes
tapered at the ends.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: You may attack with a bo staff without
triggering effects dependant upon being in melee with an enemy (such as
most damage-on-hit effects). You can parry weapons with a +2 bonus, and
unarmed attacks with a -2 penalty. When attacking, you may
&amp;quot;dual-wield&amp;quot; this staff with itself by
attacking with both ends, but when doing so lose its accuracy bonus; at
this point, it is considered to have the Dual tag for the duration of
that attack. If used as a Dual Wield attack, you do not receive the
Two-Handed damage bonus multiplier.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Naginata&nbsp; (Slashing, Piercing, Two-Handed)<br>
A weapon almost as traditional as the katana, and even more rarely
appropriated for use by ninja, the naginata is essentially a wooden
pole with a sword-like curved blade on the end.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 125<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: By sacrificing this weapon's Accuracy
bonus you can avoid any effects that depend upon you making melee
contact with your opponent (such as some jutsu). Blocking is an
additional 10% less effective against a naginata.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Tetsubo&nbsp; (Large, Blunt, Two-Handed)<br>
Rarely used among ninja, except ones who want to demonstrate how
overpoweringly strong they are, the tetsubo is a large wooden pole,
often with iron studs on the business end.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 300<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 6d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 22, Delay 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Stun 6<br>
While being wielded two-handed, the user's damage bonus is doubled
(instead of being increased by 50%).<br>
<br>
```<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Yari&nbsp; (Piercing, Two-Handed)<br>
An infantry weapon among mundane armies, the yari is about as simple as
a polearm can get: wooden pole, straight wooden blade with a sharp
point that you stick into other people.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 150<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 3d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: This weapon's damage is considered 20%
higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds. By taking a -2 Accuracy
penalty you can avoid triggering effects which rely upon you making
melee contact with your enemy (such as some forms of damage reflection).<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
# 3. Miscellaneous<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Gunbai (Large, Blunt, Fan, Two-Handed)<br>
Large fans with reinforced wooden slats, these were originally used by
generals to signal soldiers on battlefields. Then some ninja was
looking for a way to be unique, got ahold of the idea, and, well... the
usual. Though they're several feet long, these fans do (impressively)
fold.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 8d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Delay 2. You may use a gunbai to block
weapons, reducing their damage by 50% rather than 25%. This may be done
10 times before the fan breaks and is rendered useless.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Kama (Dual, Piercing)<br>
Farming tools used by the ninja of old, back before they had awesome
chakra-powered pyrotechnics. A kama is pretty much a short wooden
handle with a slightly-curved blade at a right angle to it on one end.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 11<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Kusari-gama (Blunt, Piercing, Chain)<br>
A weapon that consists of an adapted kama on a narrow metal chain with
a heav, typically iron, weight on one end. Some shinobi have been known
to replace the kama with a heavy metal spike.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 175<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Special<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 13<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: You can strike with either end. The
weighted end (Blunt) deals 4d8 damage, while the bladed end (Piercing)
deals 8d8. The weighted end can be used to attack targets up to 5 yards
away, and gives a +4 bonus to disarm attempts.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Nunchaku (Dual, Blunt)<br>
A pair of wooden handles attached by a length of rope or chain, a
single nunchaku is generally wielded by grabbing one handle and using
it to spin the other and bludgeon someone. Paired they do the same
thing, except twice as much.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 9<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 5d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: If your last non-Interrupt action was
an attack with nunchaku, attacking with your nunchaku has its total
speed lowered by 1, to a minimum of 6.<br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e.&nbsp; Sai (Dual, Blunt)<br>
A martial arts weapon, the sai consists of a single main, dagger-like
spike, with two prongs extending from the handle. The points of this
weapon are typically blunted slightly, and the prongs reinforced; it's
a primarily defensive weapon.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: +2 parry. If you successfully parry any
non-Large weapon with your sai, you may immediately, as a Speed 0
action, attempt to Disarm it. For the purposes of determining what
defenses can be used against this Disarm attempt, it is considered to
have a base Speed of 12 (the normal for a Sai's Disarm).<br>
<br>
<br>
#### f.&nbsp; Tessen (Dual, Blunt, Slashing, Small, Fan)<br>
A small war fan, used, much like their larger counterparts, to signal
troops in combat. Or, if you're a ninja, to kill people with. The
tessen, as used by ninja, is a handheld folding or non-folding fan
with, at the very least, a sharpened metal edge.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 9<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: These may be used to parry unarmed
attacks.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### g.&nbsp; Tonfa (Dual, Blunt)<br>
Originating from a small island off the shore of fire country, the
tonfa began as a martial arts implement, which ninja have seen fit to
'borrow' and upgrade. A single tonfa is essentially a circular wooden
bar the length of the wielder's forearm with a handle 1/4 of the way
from one end. Typically wielded in pairs, they're an unorthodox but
sometimes-effective weapon.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 9<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 3d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: +2 to parry, and you may parry unarmed
attacks. You may block weapon attacks and reduce their damage by 50% as
normal. This may be done five times with a single tonfa before it
breaks.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### h.&nbsp; Trench Knives (Dual, Slashing, Small)<br>
Essentially knuckle dusters, with the blunt or knobbed front replaced
by a serrated blade which extends several inches past the end of the
fingers.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 4d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: +1 accuracy when using two to attack as
one action. You may perform handseals while holding trench knives,
increasing the Seal Speed by 3 (whether you're using 1 or 2).<br>
<br>
<br>
#### i.&nbsp; Umbrella (Blunt, Piercing)<br>
Yes, umbrellas. Ones used in combat are reinforced with metal or hard
wood, making them semi-decent bludgeoning weapons, and most have a
sharp, pointed tip added at the end.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 120<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 11<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 6d8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 13<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: You may Block as a Speed 6 Interrupt
while holding an umbrella. The umbrella may do this up to 5 times per
battle before breaking and being useless.<br>

<br>
# 1. Small<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a. Kunai (Piercing, Thrown)<br>
One of the two mainstays of ninja armed combat, the kunai is a small
metal knife, shaped like an elongated diamond. On the short end it has
a handle just long enough to wrap one's hand around, typically wrapped
in cloth to improve the grip, and a metal ring on the end of that.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 2d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 5 + STR/4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Kunai may be used as a melee weapon, in
which case they are (Small) and (Dual).<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b. Shuriken (Slashing, Thrown)<br>
The other classic ninja weapon, even more famous than the kunai,
shuriken are small, flat four-pointed metal stars thrown at opponents
to distract and mildly injure them. Like kunai, shuriken are black,
making them less reflective and generally harder to spot in low-light
conditions.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 1d6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 5 + STR/4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
<br>
#### c. Senbon (Piercing, Thrown)<br>
Large metal needles, traditionally used in acupuncture. Rarely,
particularly skilled shinobi will use these with devastating
efficiency. Frequently, particularly overconfident shinobi will use
this with depressing ineptitude.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 1d4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 5 + STR/5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Senbon ignore the effects of enemy
armor.<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Large<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a. Fuuma Shuriken (Slashing, Thrown)<br>
A fairly complex device, a fuuma shuriken is four curved blades that
can fold together and be used as an improvised blade in melee combat,
or unfolded and locked open, taking on a pinwheel shape, to be thrown.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (4+STR/12)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: STR/3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: For every point you hit by, you add 10%
to the attack's total damage, to a maximum of +200% (so, if they dodged
and you hit by 3 points you'd do 1.3 times damage, and that number
would be reduced by the effects of partial defense); this does not
apply if it is blocked. This weapon's damage is considered 25% higher
for the purpose of inflicting wounds. You may also use the Fuuma
Shuriken as a melee weapon, in which case it loses all of its other
special effects and deals only 4d12 damage.<br>
<br>
#### b. Large Star Shuriken (Piercing, Thrown)<br>
The name is about as literal as it could be: it's essentially a
shuriken many, many times larger than a normal shuriken, up to four
feet from the tip of one point to the opposite. It generally sees
limited use in combat due to its cumbersome size.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (4+STR/12)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: STR/3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: For every point you hit by, beyond full
damage, you add 10% to the attack's total damage; this does not apply
if it is blocked. This weapon's damage is considered 25% higher for the
purpose of inflicting wounds. Because these are large and encumbering,
they are typically worn somehow strapped to the back; for each large
star shuriken beyond the first you are carrying you have a -1 penalty
to dodge rolls.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Exotic<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a. Bow, Daikyu<br>
A large bow, generally bigger than its wielder at six feet or so high.
The upper 'half' is actually 2/3 or so of the total length. As most
ninja find these near-useless in combat, they tend to see more use in
assassination missions.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 250<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/8) dice; die size determined by
arrow<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: STR<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: The bow uses double your damage bonus.<br>
Using a bow always takes two hands. You may take a Speed 10 Aim action
which gives the attack +4 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a
single attack. If you have to take any action which requires movement
(including dodging), you lose the benefits of your aim.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b. Bow, Yumi<br>
Technically, it's called a hankyu, and kyudo practitioners would be
horridly offended to hear shinobi calling all bows of this sort
'yumis'. However, ninja hardly care! The yumi is a much smaller bow,
typically not more than four feet long.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 150<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Stamina: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (STR/10) dice; die size determined by
arrow<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: STR /2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: The bow uses 1.5 times your damage
bonus.<br>
Using a bow always takes two hands. You may use a Speed 8 Aim action
which gives the attack +3 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a
single attack. You may dodge while Aiming, though this increases the
Speed of your Dodge action by 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Arrow (Piercing)<br>
These are necessary to use a bow in combat! Specifically, arrows are
the ammunition for bows, and each attack you make with a bow requires
you to use an arrow. Arrows can usually be retrieved after battle.<br>
<br>
Arrows are expensive not because of their construction, but because
ones of the quality that chakra-using ninja need are hard to come by;
shuriken and kunai are competitively mass-produced, arrows are not.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: d12<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Arrow, Piercing (Piercing)<br>
Arrows with narrow steel tips that excel in penetrating armor and the
like. These ignore the effects of enemy armor when dealing damage, but
lose something in terms of killing power due to creating smaller wounds.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: d8<br>

<br>
====================<br>
1. Ninja Tools<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Blank Scroll<br>
A large scroll. Most of the time these are carried rolled up to save
space. They're useless, aside from the fact that a few sealing jutsu
make use of them.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 25 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Blood Increasing Pill<br>
These pills contain a peculiar mix of chemicals that, when consumed by
someone capable of using chakra (such as a ninja) will allow their body
to rapidly replenish lost blood. When you take one of these pills you
regain RES/10 HP (but not Vitality) each IC, for 50 IC. During this
duration you take only one third damage from poison, and no damage from
effects caused by bleeding (such as certain wounds). Using a Blood Pill
is a Speed 10 action.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 250 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Caltrops<br>
Small bits of metal that are basically just four short spikes attached
at a center; no matter how they land, there'll always be a metal spike
pointing upwards. The typical use is to scatter them across the ground
to impede movement through an area. As a Speed 10 action you can cover
an area with a 5 yard radius in caltrops. Anyone moving through the
area going at more than half their maximum movement speed takes 1d4
damage for every IC they spend moving through the area; this cannot
inflict wounds.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 20 Ryo for enough caltrops to cover one 5
yard area<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Cloth <br>
Broad, sturdy cloth that looks like bandages, or perhaps mummification
wraps. This comes in large rolls of up to 200 yards; carrying more than
one roll inflicts a -1 immobilization penalty for each beyond the first
(not due to weight, but because they're bulky). Confine Scroll Seals
can carry one roll each.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 3 Ryo per yard.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e. Container, Small<br>
A container, usually a gourd, clay jug, or waterskin, commonly worn at
the hip. One container can hold 2 gallons of water or another
substance. For every container beyond the second, you suffer a -1
penalty to dodge due to encumberance.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### f.&nbsp; Container, Large<br>
A large gourd or other sort of container, several feet long and usually
worn on the back. It's heavy and bulky, but not quite enough to
restrict the mobility of a well-trained shinobi. It can hold up to 8
gallons of water, but you can only carry one with you (due to its
size!).<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 150 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### g.&nbsp; Flash Bomb<br>
Flash bombs are devices which, when ignited, produce brilliant flashes
of light. Anyone who doesn't know to close their eyes when you throw
one suffers a -4 visibility penalty for the next 10 IC. You can throw
these up to STR/5 yards. Throwing one is a Speed 4 action.<br>
<br>
You may also drop a flash bomb when dodging, in which case your dodge's
Speed is increased by 4.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 30 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### h.&nbsp; Ninja Wire<br>
High tension 16-gauge wire. It is generally only available in ninja
villages, and comes in spools with various lengths of wire.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo per 100 feet<br>
<br>
<br>
#### i.&nbsp; Rope<br>
I refuse to explain what this is. Individual lengths of rope can be
purchased up to 300 feet (100 yards), but there's nothing stopping you
from tying a few together. Tying somebody up requires 10 yards of rope,
and the person in question to not be resisting.<br>
<br>
You can tie someone up with ropes. If so, roll Espionage +10 to see how
good your knots were. The result, or 20, is the difficulty of escaping.
The user can try to slip the knots (Espionage skill roll, +DEX/10)
which takes 5 minutes to attempt (they can hide that they are doing so
via an opposed Espionage roll). This can be attempted repeatedly. <br>
<br>
You can also attempt to snap the ropes using brute force. This calls
for a roll of 1d20 + (Athletics /5) + (STR /10) against a target of 30,
requires a Stamina 25 roll, and is done instantly, but repeated
attempts cannot be made (either you're strong enough to break the
ropes, or you're not).<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 10 Ryo per 5 yards.<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
#### j.&nbsp; Smoke Bomb<br>
Paper balls small enough to be easily held in one hand, when thrown at
the ground they burst and release wide clouds of smoke. Smoke bombs
have a range of STR/5 yards, and can be thrown as a Speed 4 action.
When thrown, it releases a cloud of thick smoke that causes a -6
visibility penalty to all people within its 5 yard radius, for 10 IC.
Anyone other than the user in the area may, as a Speed 1 interrupt,
make an opposed Athletics (Defender) vs. Espionage to avoid the smoke
bomb, bringing them to the edge of their choice.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### k.&nbsp; Poison Smoke Bomb<br>
Sturdier than regular smoke bombs, and much more dangerous, these are
filled with some manner of poisonous vapor. They're used like regular
smoke bombs, but have a 10 yard radius, a -4 visibility penalty, and
persist for 25 IC. When you buy a poison smoke bomb, select a poison
(from the Poisons section) which has Inhalation as one of its possible
vectors of delivery. When you throw the smoke bomb, make a Toxicology
roll. Anyone who passes through the area must make a Resistance roll
against that Toxicology result, or be poisoned. The cost of the poison
smoke bomb is 100 Ryo, plus the base cost (unreduced by buying
multiples) for one dose of the chosen poison. Anyone other than the
user in the area may, as a Speed 1 interrupt, make an opposed Athletics
(Defender) vs. Espionage to avoid the smoke bomb, bringing them to the
edge of their choice.<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Cost: 100 Ryo + cost of poison<br>
<br>
<br>
#### l.&nbsp; Soldier Pill<br>
The proper name is 'military ration pills', but the term soldier pill
is more commonly used among shinobi. They're less rations than
fast-acting performance-enhancing drugs. Though every village has a
slightly different recipe, the pills are all marble-sized and black or
dark brown. When eaten, they have the approximate flavor and texture of
sawdust. These pills are essentially just condensed stimulants and
nutrients; taking one immediately lowers you a Fatigue category, and
gives you +5 to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls for the next hour.
Doing so is a Speed 10 action in battle. You may only take one per
battle, and no more than RES/50 per day.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 250 Ryo\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Survival<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Antidote<br>
Antidotes to several of the more popular and lethal poisons which
shinobi use are widely available, for somewhat obvious reasons. A
single dose of an antidote costs half the amount for a single dose of a
poison; multiple doses cost half as much as the first. So, buying 2
doses of antidote for Black Adder venom would be (40+20) 60 ryo, and
buying 4 doses of antidote for Yew toxin would be (60 + 3 * 30) 150 ryo.<br>
<br>
Taking a dose of an antidote is a Speed 6 action, and immediately cures
you of the poison in question and all its lingering effects. Antidotes
that act quickly enough to be useful in emergencies, such as combat,
aren't gentle on the body, with each applying a -2 penalty to your
Accuracy and all d20 rolls for 100 IC. However, for that duration you
are immune to the poison in question.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: Varies<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Compass<br>
A small, typically handheld device that has a needle inside a metal
case (with a glass cover, so it can be seen) that points,
approximately, to magnetic north when held level. These aren't exactly
precise, but they're good enough most of the time. Notably, they can
have trouble working underground or if they get zapped by a lightning
jutsu. When trying to navigate the wilderness, having a compass gives a
+2 bonus to any Survival rolls. If you also have a map of the country
you're in, this is raised to +4.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; First Aid Kit<br>
A collection of bandages, ointments, and antiseptics. First aid kits
can be used to stop bleeding from Wounds, as a Speed 10 action per
category of wound. They can also cure Burns, with a Speed of 2 per
level of severity of the burns. A single first aid kit can do each of
those once before being expended.<br>
<br>
Alternately, it can treat a wound (in the sense of, &amp;quot;this
wound has penalty X until treated, and then only penalty
Y&amp;quot;). This is a Speed 15 action per wound category, and
completely consumes the first aid kit.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 25 Ryo<br>
<br>
```<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Flare<br>
A handy little pyrotechnic device, a cylinder usually a bit too large
to fit comfortably in the palm. When lit (most have built-in starters
or strikers, to avoid the need for matches) they shine brilliantly,
enough that it can be painful to look directly at them without
squinting, and become blisteringly hot. They burn out quickly, within
half a minute.<br>
<br>
The vast majority of flares are projectiles, with built-in propellant.
Aimed upwards, they'll launch into the air. During the day, this is
typically unnoticed if you're doing anything other than staring at the
spot it's launched up waiting to see it, and know exactly where it will
be. In twilight and darker conditions, however, a flare can be seen for
a considerable distance; they're often used for signalling, though
suffer from not being too discrete.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 40 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e.&nbsp; Flashlight<br>
Flashlights are popular because ninja like to be able to see in
low-light environments! They're also useful because they can be turned
off, or on, as needed. Quite handy for staying hidden when you hear
unwanted company approaching. Flashlights have a battery life of about
half an hour. A spare set of batteries (for another half hour of use)
costs 20 Ryo.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 40<br>
<br>
<br>
#### f.&nbsp; Glow Stick<br>
A transparent small (around six inches long, usually) cylinder filled
with chemicals that, when mixed, glow brightly. A swift blow to the
stick (usually striking it against one's knee; simply bending it with
enough force will also work) will shatter the internal glass dividers,
mixing the chemicals and producing a pleasing illumination.<br>
<br>
A glow stick will glow for about an hour; it cannot be turned off once
activated, short of breaking it completely and letting the luminescent
fluid inside it drain out (in which case you just have a glowing
puddle). They're available in a variety of colors, with the most
popular ones being green and blue.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 20<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
#### g.&nbsp; Map<br>
A map of a given country. It's usually a really, really good for at
least one person on every ninja team to have a map of any country they
expect to be going through. These have only basic information about
terrain, landmarks, and settlements. Maps come with scroll cases for
ease and safety of transportation. A map gives a +4 bonus to any
Survival rolls made in the appropriate country, within reason (they
would help tracking someone, or finding shelter, but not exploring the
inside of a cave).<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### h.&nbsp; Oxygen Mask<br>
This is a small 'mask' that covers the wearer's mouth and nose, and is
held in place by elastic bands which form an airtight seal. Rather than
filtering air out, it has two possible fixtures (usually one on each
side of the mouth) for an oxygen tank to be attached. When wearing the
mask, the user has a -3 penalty to all Stamina rolls, as it takes a
slight effort to breathe through it. Putting this on in combat is a
Speed 5 action.<br>
<br>
Wearing an oxygen mask with at least tank attached makes the wearer
immune to external suffocation penalties (being inside an unbreathable
cloud would not affect them; being physically choked would) and
provides a +8 bonus to Resistance rolls against statuses that would be
inflicted by breathing something in (such as poison mist); the mask is
not perfectly air-tight.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 200 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### i.&nbsp; Oxygen Tank<br>
Tanks of compressed, breathable air, usually strapped to one's back.
They're basically useless by themselves, but each comes with a hose
that can be attached to an oyxgen mask. Each tank provides 30 minutes
of breathable air.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100 Ryo per tank<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
# 3. Infiltration<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Camouflage Kit<br>
Everything you need to blend in with the environment, like a truly
sneaky ninja. These come in four flavors: forest/plains, desert,
mountainous/rocky, and 'other' (covering anything not one of those). A
kit may only be used in its corresponding environment.<br>
<br>
Using a kit takes 15 minutes, and is enough to conceal a person at
level 3 Stealth; the stealth roll is made after they're fully hidden.
The exact contents are fairly nonspecific, but regardless, each kit is
good for only one use.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 150 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Camera<br>
Cameras are rare devices, and ones suited for use by ninja even more
so. Styles vary, but they are all small, and usually handheld. However,
they are large enough that they cannot be effectively concealed while
in use. The exact designs may vary greatly, though Sunagakure is fond
of a model worn like a circlet on the head, with the lens covering one
eye.<br>
<br>
Most models include a flash that allows blurry pictures to be taken in
the dark. Each image uses a single piece of film, acquired separately.
Facilities to develop the film are rare, but exist in all major shinobi
villages, along with trained staff who will do so overnight for urgent
matters, or within a week for personal needs.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 750 Ryo<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &lt;img <br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Camera Film<br>
These are specially treated, light-sensitive pieces of paper. Due to
the lack of standardization among models, pieces of film generally
cannot be exchanged from one camera to another. These are usually
stored inside the camera itself; if exposed to light before capturing
an image they become useless, though afterwards there will be no
effects from direct light on the paper.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 50 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Grappling Hook<br>
A three- or four-pronged sturdy metal hook. The typical use is to
attach it to the end of a rope then throw it over a wall, up a tree, or
across a small chasm, and hope it catches on something (such as a piece
of architecture, a branch, or a appropriately-shaped rock). The user
then climbs the rope to get to their destination!<br>
<br>
These see limited use among experienced ninja, who typically have ways
of easily doing the same thing, but beginners often find them useful,
and they can be situationally helpful even for more advanced shinobi.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e.&nbsp; Lockpicks<br>
A set of small tools, easily carried in a pocket, used for opening
locks in absence of the key. These allow an Espionage roll to be made
to open a lock, and also provide a bonus to said roll. That bonus has a
maximum of +5, or the user's Espionage skill ranks, whichever is lower;
you have to actually know how to use them to get any benefit. These are
reusable, though a roll of 5 or lower on the Espionage check means they
break in the attempt (which may still be successful).<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100 Ryo per +1<br>
<br>
<br>
#### f.&nbsp; Ninja Comm Device<br>
The pinnacle of technological advancement in the ninja world, these are
small wireless radios. They're typically worn as headsets with an ear
insert and a microphone held suspended near the wearer's mouth. Normal
comm devices can be tuned to transmit and receive on any of a dozen
frequencies by the user, allowing any set of devices to be synchronized
with one another. Though each village also has a few sets of specially
made comm devices built to operate on
&amp;quot;secure&amp;quot; frequencies, these are not typically
given to shinobi on missions.<br>
<br>
Commonly used in missions that require precise coordination or
infiltration, these always receive, and are touch-activated to
broadcast. They have a range of half a mile. Be aware that while these
are generally a secure means of communication, it's (theoretically)
possible for enemies to find your frequency if you're making continual
use of the comms, they know you're using them, and they're actively
trying to do so.<br>
<br>
If you suffer a Major or greater Head wound while wearing a comm
device, it breaks as a result of the damage. A comm device broken this
way is too badly damaged to be repaired, and will need to be replaced.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 500 Ryo ; 1000 Ryo for 2-mile radius<br>
<br>
<br>
#### g.&nbsp; Telescope<br>
A small pocket telescope, which telescopes out from two inches to close
to six. It allows you to effectively see what's going on up to five
hundred yards away, and read reasonably-sized text (assuming you have
clear line of sight) up to a hundred yards away. Mechanically, this
means that any Awareness rolls at a distance up to its maximum (to,
say, see when a guard leaves his post) have no penalty.<br>

Poisons are nasty business, and one of the murkier aspects of ninja
tactics. Certainly, before the days when shinobi had discovered the
secrets of chakra manipulation, poisons were a vital part of their
arsenal. The proper use of poisons, however, is hard to learn, and in
most circumstances just isn't as useful as being able to shoot
fireballs and run up walls.<br>
<br>
Some ninja, however, still find uses for them. This section is for them!<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Rules<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Doses<br>
Poisons are measured in doses. Each poison has a listed price. The
first dose costs that much; subsequent doses cost half that much, each.
This is, essentially, a limit on how many times you can use that poison
before running out.<br>
<br>
Each poison has a listed Toxicology rating. Your Toxicology skill ranks
must be a minimum of that much to use that poison.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Melee Weapons<br>
One dose of poison is enough to coat the business end of a weapon. You
can apply up to 1+(Toxicology)/10 doses worth of poison to a weapon as
a single Speed 10 action. Each time the weapon hits something, it loses
one dose. If you apply a new poison to the weapon (even another dose of
the same type), any remaining poison of the previous dose is wiped away.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Thrown Weapons<br>
A single dose of poison can coat two thrown weapons. Like melee
weapons, a thrown weapon does not lose its poison coating unless it
actually hits something or someone. A thrown weapon may hold only a
single dose of a poison; applying a new poison wipes away the old.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Types of Poison<br>
Poisons have four possible vectors: Contact, Injury, Inhalation, and
Ingestion. Contact poisons can be applied to any blunt or slashing
weapon, while Injury poisons can be applied to slashing or piercing
weapons.<br>
<br>
Whenever you're hit by a weapon with Contact poison, or damaged by one
with Injury poison, you roll Resistance against the poison user's
Toxicology. If you fail this roll (which does receive the benefits or
partial defense), you have been poisoned. You're afflicted by the
poisons status effects (Poison of some value, and sometimes other
effects, described in the individual poison) for its Duration. If
partial defense applies, it reduces the Duration, not the severity.<br>
<br>
Ingestion poisons are effectively useless in combat, but can be used to
lace someone's food. Inhalation poisons can only be used effectively by
deploying Poison Smoke Bombs.<br>
<br>
No matter how many poisons you're afflicted by, their effects do not
stack. Thus, if you had Poison 4 for Duration 25, and Poison 2 for
Duration 50, you would take 4 damage per initiative count for 25 IC,
and then for the next 25 you'd take 2 damage per IC. Any additional
effects apply regardless, as long as they don't overlap (Paralysis 1
and Paralysis 3 is just Paralysis 3, as normal).<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e.&nbsp; Identifying Poisons<br>
When you or someone else has been poisoned, it's possible to identify
the venom just based on the symptoms. You may do so after 1/10 of the
poison's total duration has passed. At that point, you can roll a
Research, Toxicology, or Medicine skill check (your preference) against
20 + the poison's Toxicology rating. Success means you've identified
the poison.<br>
<br>
If you fail, you may take a Speed 6 action afterwards to try to
identify the symptoms, which you may repeat as many times as you like.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Poisons<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Centipede (Injury, Contact)<br>
Giant centipedes aren't actually all that venomous, though their venom
causes significant discomfort, and a pervasive sensation of weakness.
Centipede venom cannot harm HP, only Vitality. A person afflicted has
their physical damage bonus reduced by (0.5, +0.1 for every two points
they failed their Resistance roll by) for the rest of the day, even if
the poison is cured. However, centipede venom has a -2 penalty to the
Toxicology roll used to inflict it. Multiple damage bonus penalties
from centipede venom don't stack; the highest one replaces any lower
ones.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 75<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 50<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Black Adder (Injury)<br>
Snake poison, and not a particularly troublesome variety of it. There's
intense pain and significant swelling at the point of contact, but
that's the worst of it. Hours afterwards, there will be a lingering,
full-body pain, but nothing life-threatening. However, your Toxicology
roll to poison a person with this has a +3 bonus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 100<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 6<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 80<br>
<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp;

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
#### c.&nbsp; Yew (Injury, Ingested)<br>
Only relatively dangerous in its normal form, the yew's toxin has
proven its value to ninja by being versatile, easily refined, and easy
to get ahold of. Unlike poisonous animals, trees don't tend to be small
or wander around. While poisoned, any time your Stamina penalty
increases, it increases by an additional 2 points.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 100<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 6<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 120<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Bark Scorpion (Injury)<br>
Stings from the bark scorpion aren't typically fatal; ninja weaponizing
the venom distill it to improve the lethality. Despite being
exceptionally painful at the point of entry, it's not likely to kill
someone, though the lingering numbness and spasms are certainly
unpleasant to deal with.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Immobilization: 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 100<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 9<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 180<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e.&nbsp; Cone Snail (Injury, Contact)<br>
A family of brightly-colored, excitingly-patterned snails, the worst of
these produce a venom which is a compound of hundreds of different
toxins. Aside from pain and swelling at the point of impact, the venom
can easily cause respiratory failure.<br>
<br>
There is no antidote to cone snail venom. If you've been poisoned, when
your Fatigue levels increases your Stamina penalty is halved, rather
than being reset to 0. You may not Rest or lower your Stamina penalty
in other ways.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 150<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 9<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 200<br>
<br>
<br>
#### f.&nbsp; Deathstalker Scorpion (Injury)<br>
Despite the name, one of the world's most venomous scorpions isn't all
that lethal to humans. As with most scorpions, being envenomated is
excruciatingly painful, far out of proportion to the actual threat
posed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Paralysis: 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 75<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 12<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 200<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
#### g.&nbsp; Death Cap (Ingested)<br>
The death cap is one of, if not the, most poisonous mushrooms in the
world. Mercifully, there's no way to process it into a weaponized form.
In addition to its Poison rating, every 10 IC which pass a victim loses
1 point of RES. These recover at the rate of 1 per week which passes
(double with medical treatment). Someone who reaches 0 RES simply dies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 500<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 12<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 300<br>
<br>
<br>
#### h.&nbsp; Brown Recluse (Injury)<br>
A shy, tiny spider, the brown recluse none the less has an especially
dangerous venom, especially to civilians; to shinobi, it's only
severely threatening. The poison is slow-acting, but still dangerous.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 700<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 15<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 300<br>
<br>
<br>
#### i.&nbsp; Black Widow (Injury)<br>
This infamous little spider's venom has quite the unpleasant, and
largely well-deserved, reputation. For the poison's duration, your
Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls all suffer from a -4 penalty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Immobilize: 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 150<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 15<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 300<br>
<br>
<br>
#### j.&nbsp; Wolfsbane (Injury, Ingestion)<br>
A poisonous plant known also as monkshood, the least of one's worries
are a severe burning sensation at the point of injury, the abdomen, and
the face. The more severe ones are staving off paralysis of one's heart
and lungs.<br>
<br>
Wolfsbane has a -2 penalty to its Toxicology rolls if delivered through
injury, or +4 if by ingestion. When poisoned by Wolfsbane, your Stamina
rolls use the higher of your Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion penalty, and
your Chakra Exhaustion rolls use the higher of your Stamina or Chakra
Exhaustion penalty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 4<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 125<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 18<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 350<br>
<br>
<br>
#### k.&nbsp; Manchineel Tree (Contact, Injury, Ingestion,
Inhalation)<br>
Nothing about this tree isn't inimical to human life. The sap and bark
are poisonous, the fruit is absurdly toxic, the leaves are sufficient
to poison water supplies. Tying people to the tree overnight is a
brutal, highly effective method of execution. In practice, ninja use
the sap as a toxin, as it keeps best.<br>
<br>
Envenomation results in severe full-body irritation and shortness of
breath. It's painfully distracting enough to inflict a -2 penalty to
Accuracy and d20 rolls, and inflicts its Suffocation effect every 10 IC.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffocation: 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 150<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 18<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 350<br>
<br>
<br>
#### l.&nbsp; King Cobra (Injury)<br>
One of the world's deadliest snakes, the king cobra's venom is a
neurotoxin that quickly leads to blurred vision, disorientation, and
muscular paralysis. While poisoned, you have a -4 penalty to all skill
rolls other than Resistance, and a -5 penalty to Stamina and Chakra
Exhaustion rolls. King cobra venom has a +3 bonus to its Toxicology
rolls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Paralysis: 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 200<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 22<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 500<br>
<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
#### m.&nbsp; Belladona (Injury, Ingestion)<br>
Also known as devil's berries, belladona's poison causes delirium,
hallucinations, and weakness. For its duration, your physical damage
bonus is halved. Anyone is able to hide from you, regardless of your
visibility penalty, if they double the Speed of their Hide action,
though in this case you get a +5 bonus to your Awareness roll. If
eaten, its Poison value is doubled.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Visibility: -4<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 200<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 22<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost: 400<br>
<br>
<br>
#### n.&nbsp; Wandering Spider (Injury)<br>
Not only is it one of the most dangerous spiders, it's one of the most
aggressive ones, and won't hesitate to attack humans. The venom is a
neurotoxin<br>

While poisoned you suffer from -3 Accuracy. Any time your Chakra
penalty increases, your Stamina penalty increases by half that much,
and vice versa.<br>

<br>
#### o.&nbsp; Box Jellyfish (Injury, Contact)<br>
Though they're not the deadliest of sea creature, they're what most
people will imagine when thinking of that. Affliction with this venom
results in convulsions, and before long will send a victim into shock.<br>
<br>
The convulsions make it exceptionally difficult to act. You can't take
any action with a base Speed of 20 or higher, -1 for every 5 points you
failed the Toxicology roll by.<br>

#### p.&nbsp; Water Hemlock (Contact, Ingestion)<br>
There are multiple varieties of hemlock, with this being by far the
most unpleasant. The plant's sufficiently lethal that coming into
contact with it purely by accident in the wild can cause death. It's a
powerful stimulant, leading to intense pain, tremors, disorientation,
dizziness, fever, hallucinations, tingling, dilated pupils, respiratory
difficulty...<br>
<br>
While poisoned, you have a -4 penalty to Resistance and Awareness rolls.<br>

#### q.&nbsp; Stonefish (Injury)<br>
The most venomous fish in the world, it's commonly agreed upon that
having an injured limb amputated is less agonizing than enduring the
pain. Though there will be a slow necrosis of flesh around the injury,
the real risk is quite immediate.<br>

#### r.&nbsp; Blue-Ringed Octopus (Injury)<br>
A small, unimposing creature, it's still one of the world's most deadly
animals. Its venom is a cocktail of more than a dozen toxins that will
kill within minutes. Thankfully they're rare, as no antidote exists.<br>
<br>
If one does have the misfortune of being poisoned, this poison inflicts
its Suffocation effect every 10 IC. Continual first aid provided by
someone else (specifically, forced respiration) will prevent the
Suffocation and Poison damage from being inflicted while it's
maintained.<br>

#### s.&nbsp; Golden Dart Frog (Injury, Contact)<br>
A rare, deadly animal only known to be native to Rain Country, the
golden dart frog's poison is so potent that most stories about it are
believed to be exaggerations. The venom can remain potent for more than
two years, and simply touching a surface the frog has crossed can be
enough for small animals to perish.<br>
<br>
Attempts have been made to raise the animal in captivity, and failed.
The common theory is that some part of their diet is what makes the
poison coating their skin so deadly. That, combined with their rarity,
makes this poison exceptionally difficult to come by--which is a good
thing. It shuts down the nervous system, leading to numbness,
paralysis, and ultimately heart failure.<br>

====================<br>
## 1. Genin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Forehead Protector<br>
A rectangular piece of metal with your village's emblem prominently
engraved. When worn on the forehead, it blocks the effects of the first
Minor head wound you receive, but is knocked off in the process.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: Free<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Exploding Tag<br>
<br>
Rectangular slips of paper inscribed with special seals, centered
around the kanji for &amp;quot;explode&amp;quot;. They're
infused with chakra, but normally inert. A tag can be
&amp;quot;primed&amp;quot; by focusing a small amount of chakra
into them, at which point they can stick to most surfaces (like walls,
or the underside of bridges; tags cannot be attached to people) and are
ready to be detonated; this doesn't take an action.<br>
<br>
Detonating a tag is a Chakra 5, Speed 10 action which requires you to
physically touch the tag in question. You may set it to detonate
anywhere between 10 and (10 + your ranks in the Chakra Control skill)
IC afterwards. When a tag is on its 'countdown' it begins sparking,
smoking, and sizzling distinctively; any shinobi will realize that it's
about to go off.<br>
<br>
Fire will not cause tags to explode, nor will they explode in a
&amp;quot;chain reaction&amp;quot;. A tag that is blown up or
burnt, even a primed one, is just destroyed.<br>
<br>
Tags do 5d20.open(10) damage, in Area 20. If multiple tags are set off
on the same IC (and someone is hit by them all), their damage is
combined for determining what wounds they inflict; explosions inflict
Blunt wounds.<br>
<br>
When detonated, tags count as a Speed 8+2 per tags attack that cannot
be made faster by any means. This uses your base accuracy, gaining no
bonuses from anything, and anyone caught in the explosion incurs a -5
dodge penalty, with an additional -2 penalty per tag in the explosion
and they add half of your NDB to their damage. However, anyone who
escapes their area before they explode automatically avoids all damage.<br>
<br>
Certain jutsu may cause tags, in which the target must defend against
the projectile as well as the explosives when appropriate.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100 Ryo<br>
&nbsp; \page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
#### 2. Chuunin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Flak Vest<br>
Often referred to as 'chuunin vests', these are what many a genin
strives to be allowed to wear. There's a jounin version as well,
slightly different in appearance but functionally identical.<br>
<br>
Any time your torso or abdomen would be wounded, the vest reduces the
wound's severity by 1, and the final damage by 25 (after determining if
you're wounded). The next time, this damage reduction is 20; then 15,
and so forth. When the damage reduction reaches 0, the vest is damaged
too badly to provide any protection and no longer reduces the severity
of your wounds.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 400 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Custom Smoke Bombs<br>
Once someone's a chuunin, they have enough pull to get these: smoke
bombs designed to your own specifications! Very nice, and such. For
pricing, first determine the 'level' of smoke bomb you want, which
starts at 0 and is modified by...<br>
Visibility Penalty: -4 (+0), -6 (+2), or -8 (+3)<br>
Duration: 5 IC (+1), 10 IC (+2), 15 IC (+3), or 20 IC (+5)<br>
Radius: 5 yards (+1), 10 yards (+2), or 25 yards (+3)<br>
Range: STR/5 yards (+0), STR/4 yards (+1), or STR/3 yards (+2)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: Level*10 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Exploding Tag, Type 2<br>
A more powerful version of the regular exploding tags, not given to
genin because experience has shown, time and again, that genin really
can't be trusted with high-end explosives.<br>
<br>
Chuunin, however, are more responsible--at least, in theory. Therefore,
they get to play with the big explosions! Type 2 tags function
identically to regular exploding tags more regards, though the deal
7d20.open(10) damage and have an Area of 30. Additionally, they deal
double damage to inanimate objects (such as walls, but not including
jutsu-based defenses).<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 250 Ryo<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Jounin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Hand Guards<br>
Gloves (often fingerless) with a metal plate covering the back of the
hand. These allow you to parry weapon attacks unarmed; however, if you
do so, any wounds (if you fail) will be applied to your hands (or arms,
or whatever, as appropriate for the rank of the wounds).<br>
<br>
That said, the first two times you're wounded doing this, the wound's
severity is reduced one rank. The second time that happens, the guard
on the back of that glove will be broken. Thus, if you wear both gloves
(100 Ryo pays for a pair), you could do it a total of four times.<br>
<br>
You may also block with these guards, with the same wound location and
severity effects. This allows you to block weapons without reducing
blocking's effectiveness.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 100 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Exploding Tag, Type 3<br>
The end-all and be-all of 'mundane' explosives, reserved for jounin
simply because of how difficult they are to produce, which is in turn
reflected in how troublesome they are to get ahold of.<br>
<br>
Type 3, like Type 2, deal double damage to inanimate objects. They deal
10d20.open(10) damage, and have an Area of 50.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 500 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. ANBU<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### ANBU Mask<br>
Hand-crafted white ceramic masks featuring mono- or bichromatic lines
that make the mask resemble some kind of animal's face. Technically
there's nothing preventing you from changing what animal it is each
time you replace the mask, but most ANBU members stick with a single
choice and use it as a distinguishing feature.<br>
<br>
ANBU masks reduce the severity of head wounds by one rank, a total of
three times before being made useless. The mask does crack, break, and
fall off during this process.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 200 Ryo<br>
<br>
<br>
#### ANBU Cloak<br>
High-quality cloaks that wrap around a user's body to obscure them from
the shoulders down. They're practically waterproof, and do a great job
of keeping out the rain. Stains--especially blood!--come right out in
the wash!<br>
<br>
Once per 100 IC you can make an automatic surprise attack with any
Small-size weapon, drawing it as a Speed 0 action, as long as you
haven't used that weapon previously in the fight.<br>
<br>
They come in black (for most ANBU) and white (for captains). Most ANBU
captains stick with the black anyway since it looks better. They're
ANBU captains, they do what they want.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: 200 Ryo<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Kage<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### Kage Hat<br>
Every village's Kage has a distinctive hat to go with their formal
Kage's robes. It's diamond-shaped with a pointed top, sloping low
enough to keep the sun from their eyes and occasionally accompanied by
a headdress to obscure the sides of their head. If worn properly, it
can also obscure the upper half of their face from view, which looks
really cool.<br>
<br>
The hat is mostly a color corresponding to the country the Kage is
from, with a white portion at the front and a kanji indicating their
country of origin in the dominant color in that section.<br>
<br>
While not useful in combat, it is a VERY nice hat.<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Cost: Priceless<br>
<br>
<br>
#### Kage Robes<br>
Formal attire for Kages, mostly white and off-white, with the lower
half (and some highlights on the upper half) being a color
corresponding to the village. They look bulky, but they actually
breathe very well! The robes are exceptionally comfortable, and while
not stylish they tend to swish and swoosh dramatically.<br>
<br>
The robes impose a -3 penalty on accuracy, dodge rolls, and Athletics
checks. However, because Kages are totally badass they can shed these
robes as a Speed -2 Interrupt. And yes, that's a negative sign there.<br>

<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Gaining Experience Points<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Roleplay<br>
Roleplay is interacting with others while playing as your character. Do
note that this does have to be with other people; playing with yourself
may be fun, but claiming you should be rewarded for it is just silly.<br>
<br>
Every half hour of in-character activity awards 2 XP.&nbsp; You
must remain reasonably active throughout this. Thus, if you were
playing for an hour and a half, but had to take a twenty-minute break
in the middle for whatever reason, you would get 4 XP, counting only
the hour and ten minutes during which you were actually RPing.<br>
<br>
When in doubt, use common sense.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Combat<br>
As highly-trained (well, in theory), supernaturally-powered fighters,
ninja can learn a lot from combat, testing their abilities against one
another. Most of the time this is (semi-)friendly practice rounds, or
spars. Sometimes it's, well... not.<br>
<br>
You get 2 XP for every 30 minutes the fight lasts, though you do not
accumulate RP XP during that time. Additionally, you may receive bonus
XP for your fight depending on how things went. Consult the lists below!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Bonuses:<br>
+1 per Fatigue level you end the battle at, to a maximum of +5<br>
+2 for every Major wound you acquire<br>
+4 for every Severe wound you acquire<br>
+6 for every Critical wound you acquire<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Penalties:<br>
-2 per Fatigue level you begin the battle at<br>
-1 per Wound (regardless of level) you start the battle with<br>
<br>
After fighting someone, you may not gain XP for fighting that person
for 24 hours. If you, however, are in a spar with them and other people
(who you haven't fought in the past 24 hours) you will still gain XP
for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Events<br>
Although the game revolves around the PCs, the world they're in does
not. Things are constantly going on off-screen, separate from casual
role playing. Sometimes, GMs will make this known through an event.<br>
<br>
These are often missions which the characters are sent on by their
village, with clearly defined objectives such as delivering an item or
protecting a person. However, this is by no means the only type of
event.<br>
<br>
You do not get XP for RPing during events, nor do you get XP for any
combat which takes place as part of one. Instead, the GM who ran the
event will tell you how much XP you have earned.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Training<br>
It's assumed that your ninja keeps themselves busy somehow when
off-screen. Maybe they're doing missions for their village, maybe they
actually training, or maybe they're just laying in a hospital bed
reflecting on their mistakes. Realistically, however, you're not going
to go over all these things when playing the game; after all, your
character is always a ninja, but you have a real life to worry about.<br>
<br>
Whatever the reason, your character gets a small amount of XP for each
day the game's been going, representing this; with the way this works,
it also helps characters made later in the game catch up.<br>
<br>
Because it can get a bit convoluted (but look on the bright side: free
XP!) this has its own node; check &amp;quot;Training&amp;quot;,
also in Chapter 9, for details.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e.&nbsp; Other<br>
You may get XP in some other fashion. Usually, this will involve a GM
telling you how much you got, and for what reason.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Spending Experience Points<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Attributes<br>
XP can be spent to increase any of your five basic attributes. Starting
out, the cost to do this is 4 XP per 1 point in any single attribute.<br>
<br>
The primary restriction on this is the poorly-named 'rule of 3'. What
this means is: the amount you have increased an attribute may not be
more than 3 points higher than the next-highest amount you have
increased an attribute by.<br>
<br>
Because an example will make it clearer: You could raise your STR by 3
points (for 12 XP). To raise it to 4 points, a single other attribute
would need to have been raised by at least 1, for a total of (4+1)*4 =
20 XP.<br>
<br>
Say you had raised your STR and RES by 12 each, your CHA by 9, your AGI
by 6, and your DEX by 3. You could raise your STR or your RES to 15
right away, but to raise both of them to 13 you'd need to raise your
DEX, AGI, and CHA by 1 each (in that order).<br>
<br>
And, to be clear, only the amount you have raised an attribute by using
XP matters; its starting value, or bonuses from uniques (or any other
sources), is not part of this limit.<br>
<br>
Aside from that restriction, raising attributes summons from a degree
of diminishing returns. The first 50 points in an attribute cost, as
stated, 4 XP; the next 50 cost 5 XP per +1, the next 50 cost 6 XP per
+1, and so forth. Thus, to raise your STR by 62 points you would have
to spend a total of (50*4 + 12*5) = 260 XP... not counting what you'd
have to spend on other attributes to satisfy the 'rule of 3'.<br>
<br>
Finally, you may spend no more than half your total XP on stats. So, if
you had 1000 XP, you could spend no more 500 XP on raising your stat
points.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Abilities<br>
The full details of spending XP to learn abilities are discussed in
Chapter 4. But, in brief: it varies from one ability to another, with
the costs being listed in individual abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Jutsu<br>
A ninja who intends to be successful would do well to have a wide
variety of techniques at their disposal. The actual restrictions on
what you can and can't learn are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Once
you meet the requirements to acquire a jutsu you want, to learn (or
'purchase') it you spend an amount of XP determined by its rank, as
listed... below:<br>
<br>
E: 6<br>
D: 8<br>
C: 12<br>
B: 24<br>
A: 48<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d. Other<br>
Anything else you can spend XP on will likely explain the rules for
doing so in its description.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Experience Bonuses<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Clanless characters, and certain clans (which will say so in their
description), get what is called an experience bonus. This is an amount
beyond your Total XP which you can spend.<br>
<br>
Experience Bonuses are given in percents--for example, Clanless
characters have a 10% XP Bonus. Take, for example, a clanless character
who's earned 100 XP from RP, 100 from fighting, and 23 from events, on
top of his starting 100 XP. This means that his Total XP is 323, just
like any normal character.<br>
<br>
However, he also has a 10% XP bonus; this means that his bonus XP is
32. Thus, in his Spent XP log (you'll read more about logs later in
this chapter) he would record XP Total as 323, &amp;quot;XP Bonus
(__%)&amp;quot; as 32 (and change the __% to 10%), and
&amp;quot;Total + Bonus&amp;quot; as (323+32) 355.<br>
<br>
Your total amount of XP spent can go up to your Total + Bonus.<br>
<br>
However, your bonus is not actually part of your Total XP. Many things
are based on your Total XP, such as bonuses to Genjutsu rolls, your
Skill Points, and Talents. XP bonuses have no effect on these<br>

&gt;# Training<br>
1. Late Creation<br>
2. Normal Training<br>
3. Eventually...<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Late Creation<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Because of this game's constantly-ongoing nature, a lot of people will
join after it starts; also, you might get tired of a character and make
a new one. Training gives 3 XP a day, every day a character exists (see
&amp;quot;Normal Training&amp;quot; below), which would leave
this people at a disadvantage. For example, if you join 100 days into
the game, everyone would have 300 XP more than you.<br>
<br>
However, there's a system in place to deal with this. Essentially, you
can &amp;quot;earn&amp;quot; all that XP you missed out on by
playing the game. The way it works is a little complicated, but please
bear with us--and look on the bright side, it means you get more XP!<br>
<br>
<br>
The first thing you need to do, when you make your character, is type
get_days on the server. This will return you a message saying something
like, &amp;quot;12 days have passed since the beginning of the
game.&amp;quot; That's your Creation Day (because the game started
on day 0). You record this on your character sheet, in Logs
-&amp;gt; XP Logs -&amp;gt; Training. It goes in the empty box
on the &amp;quot;Creation Day&amp;quot; row.<br>
<br>
Next, you calculate &amp;quot;Missed XP&amp;quot;; this is your
Creation Day, multiplied by 3. In other words, it's the amount of
training XP you would have received if you'd made on day 0.<br>
<br>
The way the system works is that you get that missed XP by playing. For
every 1 point of XP you earn normally (through RP, fighting, or
events--as discussed in the &amp;quot;Experience
Points&amp;quot; node), you earn 1 additional point of XP, until
you've received all your Missed XP this way. That can be complicated,
so please, keep reading--a mostly error-proof way of figuring this out
follows.<br>
<br>
<br>
Still in your Training Log, your &amp;quot;Earned XP&amp;quot;
row has the total of all the XP you gained from RP, fights, and events;
just use the totals from those sections (or your Total XP log) and add
them together. This is mostly just for reference.<br>
<br>
Next is &amp;quot;Claimed XP&amp;quot;; this is the lower of
your Missed XP or Earned XP. To reiterate, in case there was any
confusion, this can never go above your Missed XP. Once they're equal,
that means you've &amp;quot;gotten back&amp;quot; all the
training you missed out on by starting late.<br>
<br>
&amp;quot;Remaining&amp;quot; is also just for reference; it
lets you know how much more &amp;quot;double XP&amp;quot; you
have available.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Normal Training<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
As mentioned above, you get 3 XP for every day your character exists.
You do not, however, need to buy a calendar just for this game!<br>
<br>
When you type get_days on the server, you'll see how many days have
passed since the game began. If you subtract your Creation Day
(discussed above) from this number, that is how many Training Days you
get (filled out in your Training Log). Multiplying that by 3 is your
Training XP.<br>
<br>
So, if you made on day 100, and it was currently day 124, you would
have (124 - 100) 24 days of training. This would give you (24 * 3) 72
XP.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, combine your Claimed XP and Training XP; this will go in the
row labeled &amp;quot;Total.&amp;quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Eventually...<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
After you have the maximum amount of Training XP--that is, your
&amp;quot;Remaining&amp;quot; row is 0, after everything has
been properly filled out--you can delete your Training Log.<br>

9. Kage<br>
<br>
No matter what ranks or combination of ranks you obtain, you may only
acquire a total of 4 Unique Points from ranking up. Thus, if you were
promoted to Chuunin, then to Special Jounin, and later transferred to
full Jounin status, you would have 2+1+2 = 5 -&amp;gt; +4 UP from
your rank.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Academy Student<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Every ninja village has its own ninja academy. It's a lot like you
might expect a modern grade school to be, except instead of learning
math the students learn how to mold chakra, and instead of mandatory
sports programs there are mandatory mock battles.<br>
<br>
The ethics of training children of single-digit ages to be effective
killing machines is dubious at best; however, it's been shown that
shinobi who begin training from a young age (younger than 10, older
than 6, is the typical rule of thumb; any younger and they risk
stunting their development) have significantly higher potential than
those who begin later.<br>
<br>
Players do not begin as academy students, though it's presumed that
their character was one beforehand, and only recently graduated. The
rank is included here for the sake of completion.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Genin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
After graduating from their village's Ninja Academy students are
promoted to the rank of Genin. This is when they're given a forehead
protector with their village's emblem, worn to identify them as ninja.
They're also entered into their village's Ninja Registry for
identification purposes.<br>
<br>
At the rank of Genin they will finally begin performing actual missions
for the village, usually of E- and D-rank, though sometimes higher with
supervision. Genin are trusted to go on missions outside of their
village.<br>
<br>
While genin are typically the weakest ninja in their village, it's a
rank, not a measurement of power. It's quite possible for a genin to be
more powerful than their superiors.<br>
<br>
<br>
Genin can learn E-rank Taijutsu and Ninjutsu techniques.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Chuunin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Chuunin are shinobi who have proven themselves capable leaders within
their village, able to coordinate effective strategies during missions
and make intelligent decisions for themselves and others, and make up
the bulk of the village's combat-ready forces.<br>
<br>
The villages organize a semi-annual Chuunin Exam, with candidates from
all villages participating. This is used both for the ninja involved to
prove their worthiness of advancement, but also as a way for the
village to show off the talents of their shinobi; Chuunin Exams are
relatively public affairs, with many nobles and potential employers
attending.<br>
<br>
While rare, at times exceptional shinobi will demonstrate their ability
consistently in missions and other situations, and the village will
choose to promote them without waiting for them to pass the Chuunin
Exams.<br>
<br>
Chuunin are all issued, and most choose to wear, special flak jackets
when they're promoted. These identify them as qualified as shinobi, and
for many ninja wearing one is point of pride. Some opt not to, instead
preferring more distinct robes or capes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Promotion Requirements:<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Be able to use D-rank Taijutsu and Ninjutsu.<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Pass the Chuunin Exams.<br>
<br>
Chuunin have access to C-rank taijutsu and ninjutsu techniques. Upon
promotion to Chuunin, you gain 2 Unique Points.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Jounin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Considered the elite ninja of the village, Jounin are ninja who prove
themselves exceptionally capable shinobi.&nbsp; Jounin Exams do
exist, but they are not as public or prestigious as Chuunin exams,
which are meant to be a show to the country's daimyo of that village's
potential.&nbsp; They are sent on high-priority A- and S-rank
missions, regularly dealing with life-threatening situations.<br>
<br>
Jounin are often given squads of Genin to lead, training the next
generation as they had once done for them.&nbsp; While it varies
between villages just how important this process is, usuually a genin's
sensei is a lasting confidante and, at times, someone to measure
themselves against.<br>
<br>
<br>
Promotion Requirements:<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Be a Chuunin.<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Never inflict a critical on a fellow village
shinobi during training.<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Be able to use D-rank Genjutsu.<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Pass a Jounin exam or be selected for advancement.<br>
<br>
Jounin have access to B-rank techniques. When you're promoted to Jounin
to receive 2 Unique Points, and may choose two of the following rank
benefits.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Special Jounin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Special jounin occupy distinguished positions in their village; Genin
and Chuunin typically think the rank is 'below' jounin, while most
jounin respect a special jounin's expertise.<br>
<br>
Every special jounin has one field in which they excel. When someone
thinks of a special jounin they typically imagine interrogators,
trackers, and med nin, though many work behind the scenes as
strategists and administrators (a few of them even have fearsome custom
administrative ninjutsu techniques).<br>
<br>
Sometimes Jounin are promoted laterally to Special Jounin status;
similarly, ANBU may temporarily or permanently 'retire' due to the
psychological stress of their work, and become Special Jounin so that
the village can still use their talents. It's even possible for Chuunin
to be promoted directly for Special Jounin status, if their skills are
valuable enough but their overall performance doesn't merit Jounin
status.<br>
<br>
<br>
Promotion Requirements:<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Be selected based on your specialized skills.<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Already be Chuunin or higher rank.<br>
<br>
Special Jounin have access to C-rank techniques. Additionally, for a
single category (such as Medical Ninjutsu) they have access to B- and
A-ranked techniques.<br>
<br>
Upon promotion, Special Jounin receive 1 additional Unique Point to
spend.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
6. ANBU<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The black ops division of every village, ANBU (Ansatsu Senjutsu Tokushu
Butai) are the most elite, competent, and ruthless of their peers. They
serve as the Kage's bodyguards, and are entrusted with the most
sensitive missions. ANBU identify themselves (or, rather, hide their
identities) by wearing a unique face mask, white with a pattern in some
secondary color to make the mask resemble some type of animal.<br>
<br>
In terms of skill and power, ANBU are comparable to jounin. The
difference is the kind of missions they are assigned. ANBU are promoted
with personal approval from the Kage, and are among the most loyal and
dedicated shinobi of their village.<br>
<br>
They're also the ones most likely to be sent on high-profile
infiltration and assassination missions. Being ANBU is a mixed
blessing: they don't really have any more authority within their own
village, and while they are respected by their peers there's also a
certain stigma attached to ANBU.<br>
<br>
<br>
Promotion Requirements:<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Be a REAL Ninja.<br>
<br>
ANBU have access to B-rank jutsu, and access to A-rank jutsu of a
single category (such as Combo Taijutsu). ANBU members receive 1 Unique
Point.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
7. Missing Nin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Not actually a rank, but rather a status. This is the term applied to
ninja who have deserted their village (&amp;quot;gone
missing&amp;quot;) for one reason or another. Missing nin are, in
simplest terms, traitors. Most villages will, once they realize one of
their ninja has fled, promptly add that person to their Bingo Books
and, if the reason they left was sufficiently severe, or if they knew
village secrets, dispatch ANBU teams to hunt them down and either bring
them back to the village or kill them.<br>
<br>
Some missing nin may defect to other villages. However, even if they're
allowed to (many villages will accept, and then promptly imprison the
traitor) they are generally treated poorly and disrespected--once a
traitor, always a traitor, and in the shinobi world loyalty is one of
the most valuable traits a person can have.<br>
<br>
<br>
Requirements:<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; Desert your village. Harder than it sounds...<br>
<br>
Rank benefits:<br>
&nbsp;- So, I've got good news, and I've got bad news...<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; The good news: You're your own boss! Nobody can
tell you what to do!<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; The bad news: Your village wants you dead or
captured, and everyone else wants the bounty your village put on your
head.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
8. Sennin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Calling this a rank is dubious, at best. Certainly, it's not an
official one. These are ninja who've reached a great level of
distinction in their village for reasons other than power in combat,
but who are also skilled enough to be more than a match for most other
ninja in battle.<br>
<br>
Most sennin serve as personal advisors to the kage, and potential
stand-ins for the kage; many sennin would be suitable kages (though
perhaps not powerful enough, yet), if not for personal issues, such as
aversion to authority or a strong preference for field work.<br>
<br>
Sennin are often give free reign to leave their village and undertake
long-term personal missions--one of the defining characteristics of
them is that they're implicitly trusted by their village to such an
extent.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rank benefits:<br>
&nbsp;-&nbsp; You can come and go from your village as you
please, without being labelled as a missing nin. However, you're still
expected to answer to the Kage, and not to act against your village's
interests.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
9. Kage<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The highest rank attainable in any of the major shinobi villages is
that of Kage: the lead ninja in the village. Officially, only the
leaders of the Five Great Ninja Villages are recognized as Kages:
Raikage (Cloud), Hokage (Leaf), Mizukage (Mist), Kazekage (Sand), and
Tsuchikage (Stone). The leaders of Otogakure have taken to styling
themselves as the Otokages, though they are not officially realized as
such.<br>
<br>
A village's Kage is not an autocrat; they are still accountable to
their village's ruling council. However, the Kage is also more than a
figurehead. They are one of the village's most powerful shinobi, but
also one who knows when to listen to others and respect the needs of
their people.<br>
<br>
Though most Genin entertain dreams of one day becoming their respective
village's Kage, they generally manage to outgrow those desires. Being
Kage is hard work, and typically painfully dull to the ones capable of
doing it well (many Kages have infamously short tempers for paperwork).<br>
<br>
A Kage can either be appointed as successor by their predecessor, or
nominated by the village council. Once they've taken the position, a
Kage technically holds the title for life; most step down in their
later years and let a younger shinobi take over, remaining Kage in name
only.<br>
<br>

# Rank Benefits<br>
1. Chuunin<br>
2. Jounin<br>
3. Special Jounin<br>
4. ANBU<br>
<br>
<br>
Rank benefits are specialized abilities acquired when one ranks up.
Each rank will have several for you to choose from; you automatically
acquire any two of your choice, for free. These represent the fact that
while all shinobi of a given rank will have similar overall
capabilities, there's room for different ninja to have widely varying
areas of expertise.<br>
<br>
Some benefits can only be taken by members of certain villages, as
indicated by a label of &amp;quot;(village) Only&amp;quot;.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Chuunin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Choose two of the following bonuses when you become Chuunin.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&amp;lt; Leader &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
You're exceptionally good at properly using and allocating your human
resources. When you are the designated leader of a group, you may
activate this benefit up to XP/250 times per in-character
week.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
When you do so, you can give an order to one person (or use multiple
activations to give orders to multiple people). They have a +3 bonus to
any relevant rolls to following that order. If the order was to perform
a specific action, if applicable it will have +3
Accuracy.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
These orders must be specific. &amp;quot;Do what you think is
best&amp;quot; would not qualify. If you told someone to
&amp;quot;hold this position&amp;quot;, that would not give
them the bonus to all combat rolls. &amp;quot;Attack that
person&amp;quot; wouldn't qualify, but &amp;quot;restrain them
somehow&amp;quot; would.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, a single instance of this benefit will benefit only
a single roll or attack.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Nindo &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
You have a nindo, or ninja way, that you hold as more important than
anything else. It gives you strength and guidance when you find
yourself in need of either. This can be something like never leaving a
comrade behind (even if they promise they can, and probably can, handle
themselves) or never allowing yourself to have an unfair advantage (if
a stronger opponent is missing their left arm, holding yours behind
your back for the entire fight). The GMs must approve your Nindo.
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Once per two months (eight real-life days), while actively following
our nindo (such as fighting alongside that ally, or in the battle with
that enemy), you can activate this benefit. Doing so resets your Chakra
Exhaustion and Stamina penalties to 0, and lowers your Fatigue by two
categories.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
However, if you ever act against your Nindo (even if it's the best
decision to make, or just following orders) you cannot use its effects
for three months (twelve real-life days).&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Unrelenting &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
You profoundly don't like to give up; when you set your mind to doing
something, you do it as it has never been done before. You can spend
multiple points of Willpower (or activations of Limit Break, or things
that work similarly) on a single roll. There is no limit to how many
times you may do so for one action, beyond how many Willpower you have
to spend.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Will of Fire &amp;gt;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Leaf
Only&lt;Br&gt;<br>
What brings Leaf ninja together and in some ways makes them the
strongest of all the ninja villages--though none would admit this--is
their comraderie. That they are more or less a giant family and protect
one another as such is why the Leaf ninja prospere, because they do so
with a passion.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Whenever another Leaf ninja is Severely or Critically Wounded, or
brought to 0 HP, something sparks within you, motivating you in the
defense of one another and the village. Starting immediately, and
lasting for (maximum Willpower)*5 IC after your next non-Interrupt
action, you do not accumulate penalties to Fatigue, and status effects
which you are currently afflicted with are ignored. Any Genjutsu which
is affecting you is purged altogether, and you have a +5 bonus to
defensive Genjutsu rolls in this time. Multiple instances of Will of
Fire overlap, but do not stack.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Mist Born &amp;gt; - Mist Only&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Training to fight in low-light environments is something that every
village's ninja academy and instructors covers at least briefly. Mist
puts more of an emphasis on that than others, some say because of the
thick, choking fogs that often engulf their island home, others arguing
it's a result of the networks of caverns under the island that students
and genin often train under.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Many Mist shinobi train themselves to be particularly adept at fighting
with reduced, or even no, visibility. They adapt to low-light
conditions quickly, their eyes adjusting or other senses taking over as
necessary. Every 10 IC you spend suffering from a visibility penalty of
any severity, the maximum visibility penalty you can suffer from is
lowered by 1, applied after Blind Fighting, to a minimum of -2. For
example, if you were inside the range of a Hidden Mist Technique for 20
IC, and had 3 ranks of Blind Fighting, the maximum visibility penalty
(from any source) you could suffer from would be (10-3-2) =
5.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
However, every 10 IC you spend not suffering from any visibility
penalties, this bonus decays by 1. In the above example, after 20 IC
your Mist Born bonuses would have dissipates entirely.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
If you have closed your eyes, blindfolded yourself or something
similar, Mist Born does not take effect. Wounds and jutsu which
temporarily blind you, however, still trigger it. For area-of-effect
visibility penalties, you must actually be in the
area.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
&amp;lt; Desert Adaptation &amp;gt; - Sand
Only&lt;Br&gt;<br>
The desert is not a welcoming or forgiving climate. Those who call it
home do not consider it an enemy, but also harbor no illusions about
just how quickly their homeland will end their lives if they let it.
They learn to overcome adversity, because in the desert, there is no
other way.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
As a Speed 0 action you can activate or deactivate this village
benefit. While active, you halve all penalties from Fatigue and status
effects. Thus, Immobilization 8 would give you only -4 accuracy and
defenses and -40% movement speed; Visibility 6, however, would still
allow people to hide from you. This specifically does not apply to any
damage-dealing effects, such as Bleed, Ignite, and
Poison.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may maintain this effect for a total of 50 IC during a
battle.&lt;Br&gt;<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Jounin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Experienced Shinobi &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
You've been doing this ninja thing for a while, and it's second nature
to you by now. If you could, based on only your DEX and Uniques, reduce
the Seal Speed of a ninjutsu you know to 0 (not counting limited-use
effects, such Single-Handed Seals' &amp;quot;CHA/10 times per
battle&amp;quot; reduction), then you can perform that jutsu
without needing to use handseals.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This doesn't apply to Genjutsu, Sealing Ninjutsu, or Medical Ninjutsu.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Mentor &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
It's sort of expected that jounin will help teach the next generation
of shinobi; indeed, that's why many are given teams of genin to watch
over and train. Anyone can explain a concept, but you can actually do
so well. You'd make a great instructor, truth be told.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You can train other shinobi. This can be done with jutsu, in which case
it takes one week per rank of the technique, during which time you and
the student can still go on missions and about your regular business,
but must be able to spend a reasonable amount of time practicing. This
allows a person to learn techniques of one rank beyond their normal
imitation, and can only be done with jutsu that you know
yourself.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
For example, if you knew a B-rank Katon jutsu, you could teach it to a
Chuunin if they spent at least four weeks around you, learning
it.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You may also teach any talents under the
&amp;quot;Capabilities&amp;quot; heading which you already
know. Doing this requires ten weeks of training with your
student.&nbsp; After training is complete, they learn it
normally.&nbsp; However, their next talent must be spent to pay for
whatever it was they learned, and they may only be one talent in
&amp;quot;debt&amp;quot; at a time. For example, say you were
mentoring a student with 1100 XP, who used their first talent to
acquire Seal Training. After ten weeks they would be able to learn, for
example, Medical Training. At 2500 XP the talent point they'd normally
get would be used to &amp;quot;pay for&amp;quot; the Medical
Training they received early.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Keep the GMs informed of who you're training, and with what. There are
Infamy gains associated, for both teacher and student. And, notably,
teaching members of other villages is looked upon very poorly by your
own village and, if they find out, can be tantamount to
treason.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Staying Power &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
All this ninja-ing has given you exceptional resilience. You work
yourself to the bone and fight against impossible odds on a regular
basis; it's not even really all that memorable when you do it, any
more! Your bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls from Fatigue is
raised by +2 per category (from a default of +5, giving you, under
normal circumstances, +7 per Fatigue level).<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Back to the Basics &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Pick one Chuunin rank benefit you don't have. You acquire
it.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Special Jounin<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Skill Mastery &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Choose a single skill which relates to your role as a Special Jounin;
Medicine for a medic nin, Survival for a tracker, Chakra Control for a
seal specialist, and so forth. You must already have the Specialization
ability for that skill. When you roll below a 10 when using that skill,
your d20 roll is instead considered to be a 10. Your maximum skill
ranks are also increased by 3.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You must have GM approval for which skill you take this for. You may
take Mastery more than once, each time applied to a different
skill.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Highly Talented &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Whenever you spend a point of Willpower to reroll a skill roll, you
also add 5 points to the final result of the roll. You have one point
of &amp;quot;temporary&amp;quot; Willpower, which does not
count as one of your maximum WP but is recovered normally, which may
only be spent to reroll skill rolls.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Absurdly Prepared &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
You take the concept of being prepared to its logical conclusion, and
then keep going. You don't just have the right tools for any given
situation, you have more tools than you know what to do
with.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Whenever you spend requisition to obtain an item other than Exploding
Tags, you get twice as many of that item. Spending 100 requisition on
lockpicks would get you two sets of +1 lockpicks. Buying 10 shuriken
would instead give you 20 shuriken, and so
forth.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; General Expertise &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Pick a Chuunin or Jounin rank benefit; you receive it. This does not
allow you to choose village-exclusive benefits from other
villages.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. ANBU<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Assassin &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
When you attack an opponent who is completely unaware of your presence
(you are in Stealth and they do not know you are hiding from them;
thus, this cannot be used if you hide from them mid-battle) your attack
has +4 Accuracy and +25% damage.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Additionally, you can prepare sneak attacks at twice the regular speed.
Thus, when aborting a Prepare Sneak Attack action to perform a Sneak
Attack, the duration of your Perform Sneak Attack action only needs to
be at least half the Speed of the action you're using as a Sneak
Attack.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Deadly Reflexes &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
It's impossible to catch you off guard. You react without even needing
time to think about what you're doing, letting yourself process the
situation and get your bearings mid-battle. No matter what your
Initiative roll at the start of battle, your first action is always on
IC 0.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Critical Strike &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
You know the value of a single, decisive blow at the right moment. It
ends battles--and lives. When attacking, if partial defense applies to
your attack's damage you may spend 1 point of Willpower and cause all
effects of partial defense to be ignored for that
attack.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This is declared before you roll damage, and does allow your opponent
to, in response, spend a Willpower point of their own on their defense.
If this causes them to avoid your attack after all, your point of
Willpower is not spent.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This may only be used successfully once per battle. Remember, you can
only spend 1 point of Willpower on a single action; thus, if you had
already used a point of Willpower to roll your Accuracy, you couldn't
spend a second one for Critical
Strike.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Hunter Nin &amp;gt;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Mist
Only&lt;Br&gt;<br>
You may designate a single person as your quarry. Doing so requires a
week to study any available information on them and to, through a
mixture of not getting enough sleep and mild meditation, get yourself
in the proper mindset.&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
You have +6 to Survival rolls to track your quarry, and +5 to Awareness
and Espionage rolls made against them. Your Accuracy for attacks made
against them is increased by 3, and your damage by 25% for the purpose
of determining wounds. When fighting them, you have 1 point of
temporary Willpower, and gain another point of temporary Willpower
every 50 IC.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
It takes four weeks of mentally detaching yourself from the hunt to end
the quarry status of a person, be it because you've killed them or
given up the hunt. You may only designate one person as your quarry at
a time.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&amp;lt; Extensive Training &amp;gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Pick a Chuunin or Jounin rank benefit; you receive it.<br>

3. Effects of Infamy<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Explanation<br>
------------------------------<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
The nature of the job is that ninja are seldom well-liked by any
village other than their own. Working together with foreign nin is
certainly not unheard of, and respect goes a long way in the shinobi
world, but trusting someone with your life does not mean you should
actually trust them.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Also part of the nature of the job is that anyone who distinguishes
themselves begins to get some sort of reputation; you can be either
obscure, or successful, and despite how stealthy ninja try to be, being
both has throughout history proven to be an impossibility.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
That is what Infamy is: how well and widely known you are, the strength
of your reputation. Infamy is a curse and a blessing, and more the
former than the latter. It can, sometimes, be useful, especially if you
have a reputation for being honorable and need to convince suspicious
adversaries that you're trustworthy.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Most of the time, however, it's an albatross around your neck. The more
famous you are, the more every other village wants you dead, because
then you'll be one less advantage possessed by one of their potential
enemies.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
To be clear, Infamy is fairly abstract. If you go on an E-rank mission,
chances are no foreign ninja are going to see you doing it--but you
still gain Infamy for it. If you kill someone and nobody finds out
about it, you still gain Infamy for it. These Infamy gains are meant to
be representative of your character's overall renown, not the actual
effect of one specific action.<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Gaining Infamy<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- a.&nbsp; Missions<br>
Completing missions awards infamy; the more active you are, and the
higher-profile the tasks you're completing, the more likely it is that
somebody's going to hear about you, or that you'll develop a reputation.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Completing a mission awards 1 point of Infamy per rank; 1 for an
E-rank, 2 for a D-rank, and so forth, up to 6 points of Infamy for an
S-ranked mission.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Although characters are assumed to be frequently going on missions
appropriate to their skill level off-screen, this only applies for
actual missions run by GMs. This is awarded regardless of success or
failure.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- b. Rank<br>
For every rank other than genin you obtain, you get +5 Infamy. If
you're somehow demoted, you do not lose that Infamy, and you do not get
it a second time if you're repromoted.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Thus, someone who was promoted to chuunin then promoted to jounin would
have +10 Infamy (total) from rank. Later, they're selected for ANBU,
and after a few years of that retire to special jounin status; they're
no longer a jounin or ANBU, but still have a total of +20 Infamy from
ranks.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
The exception is Missing Nin. If you desert your village, you acquire
+15 Infamy. If you manage to be accepted back into your old village or
join a new one (good luck with that), and then go missing again
(...seriously?) your Infamy once again increases by 15; for a total of,
in that example, +30 from having gone missing twice.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- c. Experience<br>
The more talented you are, the more likely you are to stand out and be
remembered. Accordingly, for every 500 XP you have, you get a
cumulative +1 Infamy. At 1000 XP you'd get +2, at 1500 it'd be +3, for
a total of (+1 +2 +3 = ) +6.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- d.&nbsp; Killing<br>
If you kill a player character with at least half your Infamy, you gain
20% of their Infamy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- e.&nbsp; Other<br>
GMs may award Infamy at their discretion for reasons that don't fall
into any of the above categories.<br>
<br>
One notable thing that can result in Infamy: Certain jutsu, abilities,
and special techniques not necessarily listed in the PHB may require
&amp;quot;Training&amp;quot;--they're rarely, often
closely-guarded secrets. Knowing one of these is like adding another
ring to that bull's-eye on the back of your head: it's one more reason
for you to be an advantage your village has that everyone else would
just love to neutralize.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
Set values for that do exist, but they are S-E-C-R-E-T. Notably, if you
obtain those kinds of things through the use of Talents you don't
suffer that increase in Infamy.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Effects of Infamy<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The biggest effect of Infamy is that it contributes to your bounty,
should you ever wind up in the bingo books of one or more villages...
and chances are you will wind up there, eventually. Even if you don't
do anything particularly unforgivable, with high enough Infamy they'll
probably just add you as a matter of principle--though, by that point,
just to get your Infamy that high you've probably irritated them a few
times too many anyway. Bounties are, by default, Infamy*10 Ryo, once
you actually have one.<br>
<br>
Once you reach 25 Infamy, it's possible that anyone who encounters you
(and learns your name) has heard of you; a result of (35 - your Infamy
/10) or better on a Research roll means they know basic information
like your village, rank, and bounty, and possibly a general idea of
your reputation.<br>
<br>
Infamy can also attract other sorts of... unwanted
attention.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Explanation<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Logging certain things in this game is mandatory. It's unfortunate, and
undesirable, but it's also necessary for everyone's sake.<br>
<br>
Partly, this is for your own benefit. It helps you keep track of things
your character has gained, and makes it easy for you to go back and
check your work.<br>
<br>
Also, as an unfortunate truth, some people will, when they can't be
held accountable, cheat. It has happened before, frequently enough to
necessitate the use of these logs. This isn't saying that we distrust
any one person in particular--but rather, that the only fair way to
handle this is to hold everyone to the same standard.<br>
<br>
The only mandatory part of the regular character sheet is everything
under the &amp;quot;Logs&amp;quot; tab. Below are instructions
on how to properly fill them out.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Spent XP<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
This log tallies how you've allocated the XP you've earned. It's
divided into two columns: Categories, and each category's responded
&amp;quot;Allocation&amp;quot;--which is how much you've spent
in that category.<br>
<br>
So, if you'd spent 200 XP raising your attributes, you'd write
&amp;quot;200&amp;quot; in the Allocation column, across from
Attribute<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- a.&nbsp; Ability<br>
The total XP you've spent on all your abilities, both standard and
clan. It should be autocalc the total on your sheet.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- b.&nbsp; Jutsu<br>
The total XP you've spent learning all your jutsu. This may be modified
by some uniques; use the actual, modified total here.It should be
autocalc the total on your sheet.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- c.&nbsp; Attribute<br>
The total amount of XP you've spent raising your attributesIt should be
autocalc the total on your sheet.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- d.&nbsp; Other<br>
Anything else which you've had to spend XP on. Your sheet doesn't
automatically keep track of this, but you should!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- e. XP Total<br>
The total of how much XP you've earned. You'll calculate this in the
&amp;quot;Total XP&amp;quot; log; just copy the number from
there over to here.<br>
If you have an XP Bonus, you should make a note of that instead, though
keep in mind that your actual total is important for calculating some
limits. If you had 200 XP, and a 10% bonus, a good way to fill this out
might be &amp;quot;220 (200+20)&amp;quot;. That way, you know
how much XP you have to spend (220), and also your normal Total XP
(200), to use when determining things like the max amount you can spend
on attributes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- f. XP Spent<br>
How much XP you've spent on everything put together. This is the total
of your Ability, Jutsu, Attribute, and Other values in this category.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- g.&nbsp; XP Remaining<br>
This is how much XP you haven't spent on anything--you can hold onto it
as long as you wish, or spend it as you please. Subtract XP Spent from
XP Total; the result is what you'll put here.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Infamy<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
How you can keep track of your infamy!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- a.&nbsp; Infamy<br>
Each entry should be fairly self-explanatory once you've read the
Infamy node in the PHB. In &amp;quot;Missions&amp;quot;, use
the total from the Missions grid to the right.
&amp;quot;Rank&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Experience&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;Kills&amp;quot; are all explained in the Infamy node.
&amp;quot;Other&amp;quot; is anything which doesn't fall in
those categories, such as GM-awarded Infamy. And finally,
&amp;quot;Total&amp;quot; is the sum of all those boxes.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- b.&nbsp; Missions<br>
A short list of official missions you've completed for your village. #
Completed is exactly what it sounds like; how many missions of that
rank you've done. &amp;quot;Infamy&amp;quot; will be the number
of missions in that category multiplied by the Infamy-per-mission for
that rank.<br>
<br>
Total has a box for your total number of missions completed, and the
total amount of Infamy earned from missions.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;- c.&nbsp; Notes<br>
What goes here is included in the node! But, in short, it's an
explanation for who you killed, and when, to get Infamy (and how much
it was), and a list of any &amp;quot;Other&amp;quot; Infamy
acquisitions. The GMs who awarded those, regrettably, don't have
perfect memories.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
# 4. XP Logs<br>
&nbsp;- a. Name<br>
If a spar, list the people involved, if a mission, get the name from a
ST. If a RP, same as spar, list who was involved.<br>
&nbsp;- b. Type of Action<br>
RP, Spar, Mission, or Other.<br>
&nbsp;- c. IC Location<br>
The Village or outside the village the country unless ST specifies.<br>
&nbsp;- e. Room Location<br>
The room on discord this took place in.<br>
&nbsp;- f. Times<br>
The start/end times, please list your local time (CST,EST,etc)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Total XP<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
And so we come to the end! Here you'll find a column of categories,
and, opposite them, a column in which to enter numbers!<br>
<br>
For Battle, RP, Event, and Other, take the most recent
&amp;quot;Total XP&amp;quot; entry from the respective
categories in XP Logs, and copy them over.<br>
<br>
Similarly, Training is just the &amp;quot;Total&amp;quot;
number in your Training Log.<br>
<br>
Creation should pretty much always be 100.<br>
<br>
<br>
XP Bonus is only important if you have one. Unless you are a Clanless,
a Juugo Suto, or a person with the Super Novice unique, you probably
don't have an XP Bonus.<br>
<br>
You should rename &amp;quot;XP Bonus (__%)&amp;quot; to the
actual percent you have; for example, &amp;quot;XP Bonus
(10%)&amp;quot;. In the accompanying box, multiply your Total by
that percent. 10% of 131, for example, is 13.<br>
<br>
Total + Bonus is your Total XP, plus your XP Bonus.<br>

&gt;# Talents<br>
1. Introduction<br>
2. Acquiring Talents<br>
3. Types of Talents<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Introduction<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Talents are things which differentiate your character from the
rank-and-file ninja. Jutsu, skills, and abilities are all things which
are fairly common. True, most ninja won't know A-ranked Suiton
jutsu--but knowing them is less a sign that one is
&amp;quot;special&amp;quot;, and more an indication that you're
an advanced ninja.<br>
<br>
Talents are somewhere between uniques and abilities. They're not
fundamental aspects of your character--they're things you've learned or
developed over time, that are genuinely hard to come by in an average
shinobi.<br>
<br>
In a more meta sense, talents are a way of getting rare, exclusive
abilities for your character. And the best part, they're totally free!<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Acquiring Talents<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
You get talents automatically as your character gains experience. You
get talents at the following XP milestones:<br>
1000 &lt;BR&gt;<br>
2500 &lt;BR&gt;<br>
4500 &lt;BR&gt;<br>
6000&lt;BR&gt;<br>
And every 1500 XP afterwards (7500, 9000, etc.) &lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
Thus, a 3000 XP character would have two talents!<br>
<br>
You don't have to choose talents as soon as they're accessible. If you
get to 1000 XP and aren't sure what you want, it's perfectly alright to
hold off until later. There are no penalties for waiting until later to
pick talents.<br>
<br>
You can take &amp;quot;Enhancement&amp;quot; talents
repeatedly, whereas most &amp;quot;Capability&amp;quot; talents
can only be taken once.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Types of Talents<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Talents are divided into two broad categories: Enhancements and
Capabilities.<br>
<br>
Enhancements are ways in which your character is just plain better than
the rank-and-file ninja. They're things you're able to do that can't be
taught or learned, fundamental parts of you. These are all passive
benefits.<br>
<br>
Capabilities are a bit different. They're things you've learned how to
do, rare or esoteric techniques that anyone could, in theory, learn, if
they had the opportunity and dedication.<br>
<br>
Most of the talents <br>
<br>
listed in &amp;quot;Capabilities&amp;quot; can be acquired
through other means--for example, some skilled shinobi might be willing
to mentor an up-and-coming student in how to perform medical jutsu, or
you could make a deal with a missing nin to help them abduct victims
for unethical experiments in exchange for them teaching you how to use
fuuinjutsu (*coughryuucough*).<br>
<br>
That said, those things are usually very difficult to acquire, and may
come with strings attached (which may not always be visible).<br>
<br>
Learning these things through talents carry no such requirements or
downsides. You can have any RP justification you want (within reason),
such as being the student of a renowned medic nin in your village, but
there are no requirements beyond purchasing the
talents.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Generalist<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Rare Poisons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Seal Training<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Enhancements<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Celerity<br>
All your actions have their Speed reduced by 2. This functions exactly
the same as spending AP to reduce their Speed, and follows all the
normal rules for doing so; it can also be combined with AP to lower an
action's Speed further.<br>
<br>
However, because Celerity takes place automatically, it still applies
in situations where you're normally prohibited from spending AP (such
as Surprise Attacks). You may choose not to apply this talent, or only
partially apply it, to a given action if you wish.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Generalist<br>
You've got an astonishing array of skills, even for a ninja. You gain
any two rank benefits you currently or previously qualified for.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Multiple Summoning Contracts<br>
Ordinarily, a shinobi can only sign a single summoning contract (at
least, the ones listed in the PHB--special summoning contracts don't
typically count for this). With this talent, you can have multiple! Not
sure how you convinced the various summon animals to be okay with this,
but congratulations.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Prodigy<br>
You acquire a single rank benefit. This can be from a rank you've never
had, and even one exclusive to another village (such as taking Hunter
Nin when you're a Leaf Chuunin).<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e.&nbsp; Skill Specialist<br>
You have an additional XP/200 Skill Points. You may only take Skill
Specialist once.<br>
<br>
Taking this multiple times allows you to apply it to a different skill
each time, or repeatedly to the same skill. If applied to the same
skill, each additional application of Skill Specialist gives another
daily reroll.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Capabilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#### a.&nbsp; Eight Gates<br>
In the human body, there are eight 'gates' along the body's chakra
circulatory system responsible for regulating the flow of chakra, and
by extension providing physical limiters to the body for its own
protection.<br>
<br>
You may take this talent up to three times. Each time you take it, you
gain access to two of the gates. The first time you take this talent,
you gain the ability to open the 1st and 2nd gates; the second time
gives you access to the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th gates; and, finally,
taking the Eight Gates talent a third time changes the wounding
equation in gates to 3*(gate opened) + (base Speed of the action) + (AP
used) %<br>
<br>
See &amp;quot;The Eight Gates&amp;quot; for more information
about how these work.<br>
```<br>
```<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### b.&nbsp; Kage Bunshin<br>
You learn martial ar--Kage Bunshin no Jutsu! It's a not-quite-forbidden
technique, and probably the most powerful of the cloning techniques
usable by ninja without advanced bloodlines. Unfortunately, it's also
very draining on the user, almost prohibitively so.<br>
<br>
See &amp;quot;Kage Bunshin&amp;quot; for the rules for this
technique.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### c.&nbsp; Summoning Contract<br>
You've signed a blood contract with one of the various species of
intelligent, super-powered animals that ninja are able to call upon.
How this happens varies; some shinobi have mentors who, as part of
training an apprentice to be their successor, will offer them the
chance to sign one of these contracts.<br>
<br>
With this talent, however, you probably took the 'natural' approach: a
ninja who hasn't signed a contract and attempts to performing the
Summoning Technique will instead be
&amp;quot;reverse-summoned&amp;quot; to the home of whichever
animal species they have the strongest affinity for (which can change
over a ninja's life). There, they will usually be given an opportunity
to sign a blood contract before being sent back to where they came from.<br>
<br>
Pick a single summoning contract--you now have access to it, as
describe in &amp;quot;Summoning.&amp;quot; To actually summon
any of the creatures, or use any of the techniques, provided by this
talent you first need the C-rank ninjutsu &amp;quot;Kuchiyose no
Jutsu.&amp;quot; If you have this talent, you may purchase that
technique without meeting the normal requirements for learning C-rank
jutsu.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
#### d.&nbsp; Medical Training<br>
Medical jutsu are particularly difficult to learn compared to normal
techniques, due to the extreme amounts of precision, and knowledge of
the human body, they require.<br>
<br>
You got someone to teach you the principles of medical ninjutsu, or
were one of the rare few who managed to figure them out yourselves
after months of exhausting study. This talent allows you to learn
Medical Ninjutsu of D- and C-rank.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### e.&nbsp; Natural Chakra<br>
In addition to the chakra within shinobi--and indeed, in every living
being--there is chakra permeating the entire world. Normally, this
matters no more to shinobi than the oxygen in the air they breathe.
It's possible to learn how to access this natural chakra, which is what
you've done with this talent.<br>
<br>
Natural chakra use is broken down into three tiers: Enlightened, Adept,
and Sage. Each time you take this talent you gain access to one of the
tiers, in order; accordingly, you can take it up to three times.<br>
<br>
<br>
#### f. Rare Poisons<br>
You have access to two of the rarest, deadliest poisons in the world:
that of the golden dart frog, and the blue-ringed octopus. As the
villages tend to have very small supplies of these venoms on hand (if
they even have any at all), this usually involves shady contacts or
harvesting the toxins yourself.<br>
<br>
You cannot take this talent before you have 35 ranks of the Toxicology
skill. With it, you are able to purchase doses of Golden Dart Frog or
Blue Ringed Octopus poisons (found in Chapter 8) using Requisiton or
Savings.<br>
<br>
Each dose costs 1000 Ryo; unlike normal poisons, the price does not go
down for buying them in bulk. You can have a maximum of two doses (of
the same poison, or one of each) purchased with Requisition at a time.
After using one, you must two OOC weeks before replacing it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### g.&nbsp; Seal Training<br>
Seals as in sealing techniques (fuuinjutsu), not handseals! These are
advanced, highly specialized techniques; they're not necessary to be a
ninja, by any means, but they can be useful.<br>
<br>
You understand enough about the principles above fuuinjutsu to use some
of the more advanced techniques. Most of the time, this is because you
got someone (a sensei, or a jounin who you did enough favors for) to
teach you, but some particularly eruditious students are able to piece
together what they need to do on their own.<br>
<br>
This allows you to learn C- and B-rank Sealing
ninjutsu.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

4. How to Read<br>
5. Restrictions<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Introduction<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Inside the human body there are eight gates which regulate the flow of
energy through the person's chakra circulatory system. They have the
function of self-imposed biological limiters, preventing a person from
catastrophically overexerting themselves.<br>
<br>
Ninja, however, are nothing if not cheerily self-destructive.
Inevitably, shinobi found the way to forcibly, temporarily
&amp;quot;open&amp;quot; these gates. The result is a surge of
chakra flow through the body, and an accompanying spike in physical
performance.<br>
<br>
The downside is that accessing the gates pushes the human body well
beyond its tolerance. While being able to access the gates for a brief
surge of power does provide a substantial tactical advantage, doing so
for even a short time can seriously injure the user.<br>
<br>
As mentioned, there are eight gates, but learning how to open each one
is an endeavor unto itself; knowing how to open the first and second
gates doesn't mean you understand the third.<br>
<br>
&lt;img <br>

<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
====================<br>
2. Rules<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Each gate confers its own set of benefits and abilities which you
receive and can use while it's open, described under the individual
gate's effects.<br>
<br>
When the gates are opened, you have access to a special, second pool of
Action Points, starting at 0 and with a maximum of half your normal AP
maximum (in other words, AGI/4).<br>
<br>
AP provided by the gates (listed under &amp;quot;AP
Gain&amp;quot; in their respective entries) goes into this pool. AP
from the gates may only be spent on the following things:<br>
&amp;gt; Reducing the Speed of taijutsu attacks<br>
&amp;gt; Abilities provided by the gates<br>
&amp;gt; The ability Principle of Motion<br>
&amp;gt; The ability Surge (though if improving Accuracy, only for
unarmed attacks)<br>
<br>
Your regular AP may still be spent normally, as well as on abilities
provided by the gates.<br>
<br>
Once you're able to access the gates, you gain the following two
actions:<br>
<br>
<br>
Open Gates (Speed 5 + 3 * X, Stamina 15 + 5 * X)<br>
You open one or more of the eight gates. By default, this opens only a
single gate; you may choose to open several at once, for a total of 1 +
X gates. Doing this, however, drastically increases the strain put upon
your body, causing you to immediately suffer X wounds (as described in
Wounding, below).<br>
<br>
For example, if you had two gates open, and wanted to open three more,
it would be a Speed (5 + 3*2) 11 action, with a Stamina cost of (15 +
5*2) 25, and you'd suffer 2 random wounds.<br>
<br>
<br>
Close Gates (Speed 5 + 5 * X)<br>
You take several moments to calm yourself and stabilize your chakra
flow before willing your chakra gates shut. This shuts all open gates,
with X being the number currently opened. Unlike opening, closing them
is all-or-nothing.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Wounding<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
As mentioned above, using the gates is devastating, in no small part
because doing so gives the user's body the ability to physically tear
itself apart.<br>
<br>
Every time you take an action with a Stamina or Chakra cost while using
the gates, you have a chance to wound yourself. That chance is:<br>
<br>
5*(gate opened) + (base Speed of the action) + (AP used) %<br>
<br>
For example, say you had opened the second gate and used a basic
unarmed attack (Speed 8), and spent 4 AP to reduce it down to Speed 4.
After performing your action you'd roll 1d100, and on a roll of (5*2 +
8 + 4) = 24 or lower, you'd immediately suffer a wound.<br>
<br>
These wounds cannot be prevented or reduced in severity. The gates
inflict Blunt wounds. When you suffer one, roll for location.<br>
<br>
The first wound you suffer on a given location in a single week (OOC
day) from the gates is a Minor wound. The second is a Major, the third
a Severe, and the fourth a Critical.<br>
<br>
For example, if you wounded yourself using the gates six times, and
rolled head three times, left arm once, right arm once, and chest once,
you'd have:<br>
A minor, major, and severe head wound<br>
Two minor arm wounds<br>
And a minor chest wound<br>
<br>
For a total of six different wounds.<br>
<br>
Additionally, any wound-healing abilities (such as some Medical
ninjutsu, or Henzaki Organ Mobility) cannot be used while the gates are
still open: you have to close them first.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. How to Read<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Each gate contains a brief description of what it does, an
&amp;quot;AP Gain&amp;quot; number, and an ability.<br>
<br>
Every time the IC reaches a multiple of 10, you gain the action points
listed under AP Gain, added to your gates-specific pool of AP. If that
pool is full, any excess AP are simply list.<br>
<br>
You only receive the AP Gain of the highest gate you have open.<br>
<br>
Each gate also has a listed ability, such as the first gate's Enhanced
Strength and the second gate's Rejuvenation. You have access to the
abilities of all opened gates. For example, with the third gate open
you would be able to use Enhanced Strength (first), Rejuvenation
(second), and Enhanced Power (third).<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Restrictions<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The eight gates work poorly with weapons, much to the woe of many
shinobi.&nbsp; This has a great deal to do with their nature: while
they grant overwhelming power, the user's technique tends to suffer as
a result. Weapons simply aren't meant to be used by a body tearing
itself apart, or swung with that sort of speed and force.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, some of the abilities granted by the gates do not work
with weapons as well as they do with unarmed attacks. Specifically...<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Enhanced Strength: Cannot be used with weapons.<br>
&lt;br&gt; Enhanced Power: Cannot be used with weapons.<br>
&lt;br&gt; Enhanced Speed: Does not increase weapon Accuracy.<br>
&lt;br&gt; Extreme Speed: May not be used to raise weapon
Accuracy.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
Additionally, members of the Hozuki clan cannot open the gates when
using their Hydration Technique--their body has no bones, muscles, or
circulatory system to enhance.<br>
<br>
Activating the technique will not close any open gates, but will
suspend all their effects (including AP generation, ability to spend
Gates AP, and the chance to wound oneself when acting) until the
Hydration Technique is ended.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page <br>
<br>
# The Gates<br>
##&nbsp;&nbsp; -= The First Gate =-<br>
###&nbsp; -= Kaimon - Gate of Opening =-<br>
<br>
Located in the brain, opening this gate removes the body's ability to
limit the output of its muscles.<br>
<br>
AP Gain: 5<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhanced Strength<br>
You can spend AP to increase your Physical Damage Bonus for a single
attack, at the rate of 1 AP per 0.4. You may spend up to STR/10 AP this
way.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
##&nbsp;&nbsp; -= The Second Gate =-<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; -= Kyuumon - Gate of Healing =-<br>
<br>
Also located in the brain, the second regulates the body's breakdown of
stored energy. By opening it, the body gains the ability to access its
energy reserves faster than would normally be physically possible.<br>
<br>
AP Gain: 10<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rejuvenation<br>
You may spend AP at any time to reduce your Stamina penalty. Every 2 AP
spent reduces your Stamina penalty by 1.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
##&nbsp;&nbsp; -= The Third Gate =-<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; -= Seimon - Gate of Life =-<br>
<br>
Located on the spinal cord between the shoulders, opening the third
gate results in one's blood vessels dilating, causing increased blood
flow throughout the body.<br>
<br>
Opening this gate also has the effect of turning the user's skin a very
marked reddish color.<br>
<br>
AP Gain: 15<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Accelerated Bloodflow<br>
The increased flow of blood to all regions of your body keeps your
cells oxygenated and able to perform at their peak. You reduce your
Fatigue penalties by the number of gates you have open. Therefore, if
you were at Fatigue 4 with the third gate open, you would have only a
-1 penalty to Accuracy and a -5 penalty to defenses.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
##&nbsp;&nbsp; -= The Fourth Gate =-<br>
###&nbsp; -= Shoumon - Gate of Pain =-<br>
<br>
Located below the Gate of Life, the fourth gate got its name for a very
simple reason: beyond what's normal even for the other gates, opening
causes severe pain across the entire body as the overwhelming flow of
chakra begins physically tearing the user's muscle fibers.<br>
<br>
<br>
AP Gain: 20<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhanced Power<br>
For every AP you spend reducing an attack's Speed, you may spend
another AP to &amp;quot;buy back&amp;quot; the lowered damage
bonus.<br>
<br>
For example, say you spent 4 AP to bring a basic unarmed attack from
Speed 8 to Speed 4. Normally you would deal (damage bonus)*(4) damage
with this attack, because its Speed is 4. However, with Enhanced Power
you could spend up to 4 AP increasing its effective Speed.<br>
<br>
Thus, if you spent 3 AP on Enhanced Power, you'd deal (damage
bonus)*(7) damage.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
##&nbsp;&nbsp; -= The Fifth Gate =-<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; -= Tomon - Gate of Limit =-<br>
<br>
Located in the middle of the torso, the fifth gate is below the fourth
on the spinal column (which also serves as the body's primary chakra
meridian). Opening results in a marked increase in speed and power for
the shinobi who does so, but begins tearing tendons away from the bones
they're anchored to.<br>
<br>
AP Gain: 25<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhanced Speed<br>
Every 5 AP you spend on attack increases its Accuracy by 1. Every 5 AP
you currently have in your gate-specific AP pool gives you a +1 bonus
to dodge rolls.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
##&nbsp;&nbsp; -= The Sixth Gate =-<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; -= Keimon - Gate of View =-<br>
<br>
Placed in the lower abdomen, the gate of view is responsible for,
relative to the previous five, gross regulation of chakra, with the
first five gates fine-tuning its distribution to one extent or another.<br>
<br>
Simply opening the sixth gate results in the body blasting chakra out
from every one of its tenketsu. While it's open the user will radiate a
strong artificial 'wind'; trees will bend away, and water will rise
form vortexes around them.<br>
<br>
AP Gain: 30<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Extreme Speed<br>
After making an attack or attempting to dodge and seeing if it succeeds
or fails, you may spend AP to increase its result by 1 for every 10
points of AP spent.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you may use Enhanced Strength or Enhanced Power after
determining if your attack hits.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
Note: The last two gates can only be obtained by GM approval.<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
##&nbsp;&nbsp; -= The Seventh Gate =-<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; -= Kyoumon - Gate of Wonder =-<br>
<br>
Located near the base of the spine, at hip level, the seventh gate
results in the most marked physical changes since the third. The user
begins using glowing green sweat from their pores; the amounts of
chakra rushing through the user's chakra circulatory system are
becoming genuinely destructive to the body, and so it tries to vent it
out the only way it can... resulting in glowing green, chakra-infused
sweat.<br>
<br>
Additionally, merely having this gate open results in shredding one's
muscle fibers. While chakra can make up for lost functionality, even a
light touch causes severe pain to someone who's opened the seventh gate
recently.<br>
<br>
AP Gain: 40<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Defiance<br>
So long as the Seventh Gate remains open, you ignore the effects of all
wounds you're suffering from (though they will still accumulate
normally)<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
##&nbsp;&nbsp; -= The Eighth Gate =-<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; -= Shimon - Gate of Death =-<br>
<br>
Located near the heart, this is the final option for any user of the
gates, when accomplishing their goal is more important than their life.
With all eight gates opened, there's nothing to regulate the body's
chakra flow, and since it's inherently tied to every major organ in the
body, there's very little to regulate organ function either.<br>
<br>
Opening the eighth gate will cause the user's death, without exception.
However, for those few minutes before their heart literally pumps
itself to death, before their raging chakra system finishes tearing
their organs into pulp, and before they convert vital portions of their
body into energy, a user of the eighth gate has unrivaled power.<br>
<br>
AP Gain: 50<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Last Stand<br>
When you first open the eighth gate, all wounds you are presently
suffering from are removed. So long as the Eighth Gate remains open,
your HP cannot be reduced below 1.<br>
<br>
However, when you fall unconscious or close the Eighth Gate, or when
you have a Blunt Critical Wound on every location of your body (both
arms, both legs, chest, abdomen, head), you die.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
### --( Kage Bunshin no Jutsu - Shadow Clone Technique )--<br>
Perhaps the pinnacle of development for the ninja replication technique
is this jutsu. Whereas bunshin creates what are essentially illusions,
shadow clones use chakra to create a perfect copy of the original
person.<br>
<br>
Despite this, they are fairly delicate and unstable; a solid blow will
harm the clone as if it was flesh and blood, but moments later the
bunshin will vanish in a puff of smoke.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5, +2 per clone<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 5, +2 per clone<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may create any number of clones; however, each clone raises your
Fatigue level by 1. You can't regain Fatigue spent on clones so long as
they exist. When created, Kage Bunshin have all Wounds and Upkeeps you
do, but not status effects. Wounds gained, and Upkeeps activated, after
they're created do not automatically transfer to the clones.<br>
<br>
Kage bunshin can perform any action other than creating more clones;
they can even perform handseals and use jutsu. Kage Bunshin are always
at Fatigue 1, and if they fail a Fatigue roll or take any damage
they're destroyed.<br>
<br>
If a clone is destroyed, you do not get its Fatigue level back. You
may, as a Speed 5 + 2 * X action, end 1 + X clones. Clones ended this
way vanish in a puff of smoke, and you regain the Fatigue level spent
on them.<br>
<br>
Although you do not have a mental link with your clones, when one
ceases to exist (either because it's destroyed or because you
voluntarily ended it) you gain memories of all the experiences it had
in the time when it was separated from you. These memories, while
'legible', seem slightly unreal, the mental equivalent of looking at a
photograph's negatives (meaning you can't confuse them with your own
&amp;quot;real&amp;quot; memories).<br>
<br>
<br>
In combat, as mentioned, kage bunshin can act as if they were you. If
they are present at the start of battle, they use your initiative roll;
otherwise, they may act the IC after they're created.<br>
<br>
Mentally commanding your clones to act costs 1 AP per 5 Speed of the
action they're going to use.<br>
<br>
For example, say you made a Shadow Clone, and on IC 80 you wanted it to
punch an enemy. This is a Speed 8 action, so you'd spend 2 AP, and your
clone couldn't act again until IC 88.<br>
<br>
If, on IC 85, somebody attacked your clone, you could spend 1 AP to
have it take a Dodge action (Speed 2), after which you wouldn't be able
to give it another non-Interrupt order until IC 90.<br>
<br>
When Kage Bunshin attack, their actions are always considered to be
Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5; they use half your damage
bonus on your attacks, and the severity of wounds they inflict is
reduced one category. This applies even if you do not have the Hold
Back ability.<br>
<br>
Clones do not accumulate AP, and you may not spend AP to reduce the
Speed of their actions. They do not have their own Willpower, but you
may spend your own Willpower for them.<br>
<br>
<br>
When created, Shadow Clones have all your equipment, with the following
exceptions:<br>
1. Consumable items (flash and smoke bombs, poison, exploding tags, and
so on).&nbsp; Anything which, after being used, cannot be reused.<br>
2. Chakra-infused items (such as storage scrolls) are physically
replicated, but have no special properties.<br>
3. No electronic items (cameras, comm devices) or items with complex
moving parts function.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

&gt;## Natural Chakra<br>
1. Introduction<br>
2. Learning<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Introduction<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Chakra is everywhere, an intangible force permeating the world. For the
most part, ninja (and everyone else) ignore this. It's like knowing
that there's oxygen all around: necessarily for life, but not
particularly worthy of attention since it's always there.<br>
<br>
It does play an important roll for shinobi: they naturally respire
chakra from the environment, just like they inhale and exhale air, but
as chakra is omnipresent, it never matters.<br>
<br>
It's called 'natural chakra'. Very rarely, some ninja manage to learn
how to access it. The scarcity of this ability has a lot to do with the
fact that in most situations, it's impractical: accessing nature chakra
requires one to be able to sit calmly and undisturbed for a significant
amount of time, something which ninja rarely have the opportunity to do
when under pressure.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Learning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Learning to access nature chakra is not something one simply does: it
takes months of slowly learning to harmonize oneself with the world
around them, gradually learning to deliberately calm the flow of chakra
within their own body.<br>
<br>
Similarly, someone who can use nature chakra does not progress in
stages; it's a natural growth, a process of inner learning.<br>
<br>
However, that would be horribly difficult to represent with game
mechanics, so natural chakra is conveniently broken down into three
tiers! They are, in order: Enlightened, Adept, and Sage.<br>
<br>
Within each tier, there are several abilities (which can be logged
either under Other, or by creating a new ability breakdown for nature
chakra). By each ability there is a listed XP cost, which you must pay
to learn it. You can purchase any ability within a tier you have access
to, so long as you meet its listed requirements.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
### Natural Chakra Abilities<br>
1. Enlightened<br>
2. Adept<br>
3. Sage<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Enlightened<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Meditation (10 XP)<br>
The most basic ability someone seeking to harness natural chakra must
master, this is precisely what it sounds like. You sit down, close your
eyes, and become perfectly still, clearing your mind.<br>
<br>
Obviously, this is easier said than done; a novice will find themselves
thinking about not thinking, then their nose will start to itch,
they'll get fidgety... and that is where most give up in frustration
and go back to studying high-power ninjutsu.<br>
<br>
When meditating you cannot talk, or even open your eyes to look around,
though you do remain aware of your surroundings to the extent of what
you can feel and hear. Indeed, much of meditation is learning how to
observe one's surroundings impartially, without reacting. You cannot
maintain any Upkeeps greater than 0 while meditating.<br>
<br>
In battle, you may declare Meditate as an action. When meditating, you
do nothing. Meditate as an action lasts until you declare that you
Abort it; you do not need to declare how long you'll be meditating when
you begin.<br>
<br>
There are two ways to end meditation. <br>
<br>
The first is with End Meditation, a Speed 5 action which cannot have
its Speed reduced.<br>
<br>
The second is your meditation being disrupted. This occurs if you take
any action other than End Meditation, if you are hit by any damaging
attack, or if you are moved in any way. If this happens, you have a -5
penalty to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina, Accuracy, and all d20 rolls,
for the next 10 IC.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; A Tranquil Body (10 XP)<br>
As you meditate your body relaxes and is refreshed, weariness ebbing
away and pain fading. Every 10 IC you spend meditating, your Stamina
penalty is reduced by 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; A Tranquil Mind (10 XP)<br>
By emptying your mind, you reach a state of total serenity. Your
emotions fade away, letting you assess things calmly and rationally.
With that tranquility comes inner balance, disturbances of the mind
translating into disturbance of one's chakra, and their absence doing
the same. Every 10 IC you spend meditating, your Chakra Exhaustion
penalty is reduced by 1<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; A Tranquil Soul (20 XP)<br>
When your mind and body are in harmony, each completely silent and at
ease, your spirit becomes the same. Once you've been meditating for 20
IC, you may sacrifice a point of Willpower to lower your Fatigue level
by 1. After doing so, you must wait at least 20 IC before using it
again.<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Requires: A Tranquil Body, A Tranquil Mind<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Path to Tranquility (10 XP)<br>
If you spend at least 100 IC meditating, the first time you fail a
Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina roll in the next ten minutes you advance
one less Fatigue category; your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties
still reset to 0.<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Requires: A Tranquil Soul<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Dream of the World (20 XP)<br>
As one sinks into meditation, they become detached from their worldly
senses and the accompanying distractions. Only by doing so can they
notice the minute variations in the world's own chakra, in all their
subtle wonder.<br>
<br>
While meditating, you can tell how many people are within X yards,
where X is the number of IC you've spent meditating, up to a maximum of
your CHA. This does not, however, allow you tell anything else about
them, even their direction or distance.<br>
<br>
Except in combat! In combat, this allows you to find hiding enemies.
Every 5 IC you spend meditating while a hidden enemy is within your
range, you may make a Chakra Control roll against their Stealth TN,
with a +2 bonus for every 5 IC (total) you've been meditating.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Requires: A Tranquil Soul<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Adept<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; One With Nature (20 XP)<br>
Up until now, you've managed to 'sort of' meditate properly: you're
almost sitting still, you're mostly not distracted. Becoming one with
nature requires a higher level of discipline.<br>
<br>
The phenomenon commonly described as being 'one with nature' is where a
person is so still, so unresponsive, that the world's ambient chakra
can flow unhindered through their chakra coils, as if they were just
another tree or current of wind.<br>
<br>
As this takes place, nature chakra builds up within the shinobi's
chakra system. While there are dangers associated with it, they don't
manifest at this level. Every 5 IC you spend meditating, you get one
nature chakra counter (NC). You may have a maximum of up to (RES+CHA)/4
nature chakra counters.<br>
<br>
However: If your meditation is broken through any means other than an
End Meditation action (or, once you have the ability, activating Sage
Mode), you lose all your accumulated nature chakra counters.<br>
<br>
Once a person stops meditating, this chakra is quickly cycled through
their system and disposed of. You lose one NC every 5 IC when not
meditating.<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Requires: Path to Tranquility<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Body of Metal (20 XP)<br>
Nature is unyielding; it is powerful, and will crush any who think
themselves its better. For every NC you currently have, your damage
bonuses are increased by 0.1 with everything but weapons; with weapons,
your damage bonus is increased by 0.1 for every 2 NC you currently have.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Body of Water (20 XP)<br>
Nature is adaptable; it changes to meet the needs of its current
situation, not because it yields, but because it will always be
victorious under any circumstances. After seeing the result of a Chakra
Exhaustion or Stamina roll, you may spend 3 NC to increase the result
by 1; there is no limit on how many NC you may spend this way on a
single roll.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Body of Fire (20 XP)<br>
Nature is furious; it destroys, it obliterates. It is the raging
wildfire, the roar of thunder. You may spend NC to increase your damage
bonus by a single attack, at the rate of 0.3 for every NC spent, or 0.1
for each NC spent with weapon attacks. You may increase your base
damage bonus by up to 25% of its base value using Body of Fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Body of Wood (20 XP)<br>
Nature is patient; it grows slowly, knowing that there is no need to
rush, that the destination is what matters, not the time taken to get
there. When taking any action, you may spend up to 5 NC to improve the
result of any Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls it causes you to make.
Every NC spent gives you +1 to that roll's result.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Body of Earth (20 XP)<br>
Nature is gentle; it nourishes, it strengthens, and it protects. While
flowing through your chakra coils it infuses every bit of your body,
reinforcing your skin, bones, muscles, and nerves. Every NC you
currently have gives a Damage Reduction (DR) of 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; A Dream of a Dream (20 XP)<br>
Every person alters the flow of chakra around them in a unique,
distinctive way; some people brighten the world merely by being there,
while others darken, and still others are like deep pits from which no
light can escape.<br>
<br>
When you sense someone using A Dream of the World, you can identify
their chakra in the future. Having met someone in the past doesn't mean
you can immediately identify their chakra.<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Requires: A Dream of the World<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Sage<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Path to Inner Peace (50 XP)<br>
Before, your meditation was almost childish: what you thought was
perfection was in truth a tribute to its own flawed nature. What you
thought was a deep understanding of the world was an immature attempt
to define something which no words could hope to describe. What you
thought was control of your own body was only ignorance of your own
lack of discipline.<br>
<br>
You're not sure when you realized how wrong you've been--it was
simply... apparent, one day, an epiphany. Understanding your flaws, you
have not overcome them, but rather accepted them, absorbed them into
yourself, and in doing so let them dissolve like shadows in the light.<br>
<br>
All meditation effects take place twice as quickly: you gain 1 NC every
2 IC spent meditating, you may use Tranquil Soul every 10 IC, A Dream
of the World's radius increases by 2 yards every IC, and so forth.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you can at this point talk to others without breaking
your meditation.<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Requires: One With Nature, Basic Training 5,
Hold Back 5<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Sage Mode (50 XP)<br>
The pinnacle of senjutsu--&amp;quot;sage
techniques&amp;quot;--is, appropriately enough, referred to as
&amp;quot;sage mode&amp;quot;. Activating sage mode requires
flawless self-control.<br>
<br>
Sage mode requires perfectly balancing sage chakra with one's own
&amp;quot;yin and &amp;quot;yang&amp;quot; chakra--two
things that most ninja never even need to concern themselves with. By
drawing in enough nature chakra and maintaining it in perfect harmony,
a heightened state of superhuman performance, the eponymous sage mode,
can be reached.<br>
<br>
You may activate sage mode as a Speed 5 action once you have at least
50 NC stored, and only if you are Meditating. Doing so immediately ends
your meditation, and you may not meditate again until Sage Mode has
ended.<br>
<br>
Sage Mode lasts until you run out of NC; however, while it is active
you lose 2 NC every 5 IC (instead of 1). While in Sage Mode, your
current NC (for the purpose of determining benefits from nature
chakra's passive effects, such as Body of Earth and Body of Metal) is
always considered to be the amount you had when you entered Sage Mode.<br>
<br>
For example, if you entered Sage Mode with 60 NC, and had spent 40 of
them, you would still receive (60*2) 120 Damage Reduction from Body of
Earth, until your Sage Mode expired.<br>
<br>
###### Requires: Path to Inner Peace<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Awakening: Water (20 XP)<br>
While in Sage Mode, you have a +1 bonus to Stamina and Chakra
Exhaustion rolls for every 10 NC you had when you activated Sage Mode.
After seeing the result of an attack (whether it hits or not) or a
defensive roll (successful or not), you may improve the result by up to
3 by spending NC, at the rate of 5 NC per +1.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Awakening: Fire (30 XP)<br>
When using Body of Fire in Sage Mode, every 1 NC spent increases your
damage bonus by 0.5, or 0.2 for weapon attacks, to a maximum of 50% of
your base damage bonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Awakening: Earth (20 XP)<br>
While in Sage Mode, your damage reduction from Body of Earth cannot be
bypassed or reduced by effects which would normally do so. When an
attack wounds you, you may spend nature chakra counters to lower its
severity, at the rate of 5 NC per level: for example, for 15 NC you
could negate a Severe wound entirely.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Awakening: Air (20 XP)<br>
While in Sage Mode, you have a +1 bonus to Accuracy and dodge for every
20 NC you entered Sage Mode with. For every 10 NC, you have a +1 bonus
to Athletics, Awareness, Chakra Control, and Resistance rolls.<br>
<br>
<br>
#####&nbsp;&nbsp; Awakening: Void (40 XP)<br>
When in Sage Mode, A Dream of the World and A Dream of a Dream are both
automatically active at all times, with a radius of your Sage Mode NC
(if you entered with 54 NC, 54 yards). As a Speed 5 action you may make
a Chakra Control roll to locate all hidden enemies in range, with a +1
bonus for every 10 NC you have.<br>
<br>
If you've previously located someone this way, during the current
instance of Sage Mode, this bonus is raised to +1 for every 5 NC you
have (in other words, it's easier to find them after the first time,
until your Sage Mode ends).<br>

2. How They Work<br>
3. Avatars<br>
4. Limitations<br>
5. How To Read<br>
6. Breach of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Introduction<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
There are some things even stranger than ninja who can manipulate
chakra to give themselves superhuman abilities: for examples, animals
who can manipulate chakra to give themselves superhuman abilities.
These animals are commonly called &amp;quot;summon
creatures&amp;quot; by shinobi, as that is how they will usually be
encountered: by another ninja summoning them.<br>
<br>
Animals are summoned for numerous reasons, such as aiding in battle or,
more frequently, performing something they can do better than the ninja
calling them. The vast majority of these animals have human-level
intelligence and performance well beyond what would be expected of
their species, and most of them can speak fluently. Exactly where these
intelligent, talking, chakra-manipulating animals came from is a
mystery even to shinobi.<br>
<br>
That being said, ninja tend to be pragmatic about these matters. There
are two things a shinobi needs to summon: knowledge of the technique
(Kuchiyose no Jutsu), and a contract.<br>
<br>
A contract is exactly that: a piece of paper which the ninja must sign
their name to (typically in blood). Once the contract is signed, they
gain the ability to summon the corresponding animal at will. In
exchange, the ninja must give up some of their own chakra whenever they
call the animal.<br>
<br>
These contracts are supernatural in nature; they cannot be destroyed
(rather, if they are, they'll reform without any signs of damage). A
ninja may summon any contract they've signed, and dismiss it, at will;
some carry the contracts with them as a fashion statement or means of
showing off, while others prefer to keep them out of sight so as not to
tip their hand to prospective enemies. Either way, the physical
contract is not needed to actually summon the animal it corresponds to.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. How They Work<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
You get the contract by purchasing the Summoning Contract talent.<br>
<br>
After that, what exactly it allows you to do depends on your XP total.
In each contract's description there will be a section labeled
&amp;quot;Access&amp;quot;, beneath which you will see XP
amounts and the names of individual summons and techniques granted by
the contract. Once you have the listed XP amount, you may use the
appropriate summon; there is no additional cost to acquire them once
you have the contract.<br>
<br>
Once you have a contract and access to a particular summon, you may
call on it. To do this, you need to use Kuchiyose no Jutsu (a C-rank
ninjutsu); the Chakra cost, Speed, and so forth, are all listed within
the entries for individual summons.<br>
<br>
Summoned animals are not pets. At best, they are allies who happen to
be on friendly terms with their summoner. If you summon a creature to
perform its duty, it will do so without (much) complaining. However, it
won't casually &amp;quot;hang around&amp;quot;, train with you,
or be eye candy. If you try to ask it to do so, it will just leave.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Avatars<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
As mentioned, these intelligent animals have their own social
structures; most are fairly loose, and not organized in any fashion
particularly recognizable to humans. One thing they all have in common,
however, is the presence of what ninja have come to refer to as an
&amp;quot;avatar-class&amp;quot; summon.<br>
<br>
Avatars are the pinnacle of their species. They may not, strictly
speaking, rule the other animals summoned by their contract, but they
are universally revered and deferred to. In most cases avatars are more
intelligent, and vastly more powerful, than any of the other animals of
their species. They also tend to grow to enormous sizes, even beyond
what's seen in other summon animals (though this is not necessarily
always true, and many avatars are not actually the largest example of
the species).<br>
<br>
They're also astoundingly long-lived. Many of the avatars have been
alive for over a century, and are likely to live quite a great deal
longer still. It's even said that some of them have, in the past,
fought against the legendary bijuu--and while they may not have won,
the fact that they're still alive says a great deal.<br>
<br>
Avatars are also much more independent than the other animals their
contracts call. Summoning one does not mean that it will help you.
Certainly, some will; others may only do so for certain requests, or
under certain circumstances, or with an expectation of something in
return.<br>
<br>
In game terms, what this means is that a GM must be around whenever you
summon an avatar; they will handle the details of the above.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Limitations<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The greatest limitation in most summons is how frequently they can be
used. Each individual summon may only be called upon once per week,
unless specified otherwise. For example, if you had the Bird contract
and summoned the Corpse-Devouring Crows, you coldn't use that
particular technique for an IC week (OOC day); on the other, you could
still summon an Owl Sage or Flawless Messenger.<br>
<br>
Additionally, summons will not directly work against someone with their
contract. The techniques granted by a summoning contract can still be
used, but the full-fledged &amp;quot;Summons&amp;quot; of the
contract will refuse to act in a battle between contract-holders.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, you may under normal circumstances have only one summoning
contract, unless you take the Multiple Summonin Contracts talent.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. How To Read<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
There are some similarities in most summoning contracts; this is here
to clarify what things mean, and help you understand them better!<br>
<br>
Contracts offer two things: Techniques and Summons. For something
listed as a Technique, you are summoning animals to accomplish a
single, specific task. For example, in the Snake contract, the
&amp;quot;Hidden Shadow Snake Hands&amp;quot; technique: you
summon multiple snakes, they perform an attack, and then they are
unsummoned.<br>
<br>
Things listed as Summons are animals that will stay around for longer.
They'll take actions you ask of them (within reason), and they'll fight
alongside you or try to accomplish a goal using their capabilities in
less strictly-defined ways. Each Summon will have its own node
describing it. These are all summoned by performing Kuchiyose no Jutsu
(C-rank General Ninjutsu). The Chakra cost, Speed, and Seal Speed
listed in these nodes are the ones used for Kuchiyose no Jutsu's
&amp;quot;Variable&amp;quot; values.<br>
<br>
<br>
In each contract, the first node will be labeled
&amp;quot;Info.&amp;quot; This gives a brief overview of the
contract, including how it's viewed and how the animals behave. While
not mechanically significant, this is important to understand their
nature.<br>
<br>
Below that, there will be a section labeled
&amp;quot;Access&amp;quot;--this is important. Simply signing a
contract will not immediately give you free reign to summon the
appropriate animals at will. Summons will only respond to shinobi who
they believe are worth their time, or whose chakra is of high enough
quality. You must meet the minimum XP listed to use a given technique
or summon a specific animal.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
6. Breach of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The &amp;quot;contract&amp;quot; between shinobi and summoned
animal is, for the most part, a one-sided thing. The ninja calls the
summon when they need its help, the summoned creature renders its
services and then leaves. In most cases they ask for very little, if
anything at all, in return, beyond the chakra used to call them forth.<br>
<br>
...That is, aside from respect. Different animals have different
opinions, moods, desires, and idiosyncracies. Powerful summons will
often object to being summoned trivially, and hardly any summon will
put up with being openly disrespected by its summoner in its presence.<br>
<br>
Several behaviors constitute 'breach of contract'. For all summons,
regardless of contract, the ones below always qualify:<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; Directly attacking your own summoned animal.<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; Injuring it too badly in the crossfire (for
example, catching your summon as well as an opponent in an
area-of-effect technique). KOing your summon, or dealing enough damage
to inflict a Major or higher wound on it (counting any effects that
increase damage for the purposes of determining wounds) will qualify.<br>
&nbsp;&amp;gt; Openly insulting or demeaning your summoned
animal. Frustration in combat is acceptable, but berating it is not.<br>
<br>
If a breach of contract occurs, the summoned animal will promptly
excuse itself from the battle. That entire summoning contract will be
completely unusable for the next three OOC weeks.<br>
<br>
Most summoned animals are fairly helpful and even-tempered; in most
cases, only the conitions listed above will constitute a breach of
contract. Some, however, can be testier. In the individual descriptions
of certain summons, there will be a list of additional Breach of
Contract conditions. Meeting any of those conditions will constitute an
immediate breach of contract, with the effects described above.<br>
<br>
Notably, all Avatar-class summons have special Breach of Contract
conditions, which are not listed. One must simply assess their
personality and, based on that, do one's best not to offend them or
earn their ire--sucking up to them may not be all that good of an idea
either, as some hate summoners who aren't confident or who spend too
much time simpering.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
## Summoning Contracts: Combat<br>
&gt;1. Introduction<br>
2. Actions<br>
3. Damage<br>
4. Fatigue<br>
5. Unsummoning<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Introduction<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Inevitably, ninja will try to call upon their summoned allies in
combat, either against other ninja or to counter other summoned
creatures. Accordingly, the combat-worthy summons have functional stat
blocks for when this comes up.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Actions<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
When in battle with their summoner, a summoned creature's actions
should be tracked normally: if it takes a Speed 14 action on IC 50, it
cannot act again until IC 64. However, unlike a normal person, summons
do not act automatically. They will only take actions when directed by
their summoner (this can be the character doing it, by shouting out
instructions, or the summoned creature choosing what to do, controlled
by the player). Acting this way usually has an AP cost: the summoner
spends a certain amount of their own AP, and the animal takes the
appropriate action.<br>
<br>
AP can be spent to lower the Speed of their actions, again paid by the
user. Summons to not accumulate AP on their own. They do not have
Willpower unless specifically stated, and the summoner may not spend
Willpower on their behalf.<br>
<br>
If the summon is acting alone (for example, stalling enemies) while its
summoner is not involved in combat, it can act without having to pay AP
to do so. It accumulates its own AP at the rate of 5 every 20 IC, which
it can use normally.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Damage<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Technically, summons have HP. However, once they reach 0 Vitality they
will automatically vanish in a puff of smoke, being un-summoned. This
means that it's impossible to actually kill a summoned creature (they
*can* die--you just have to track them down &amp;quot;in
person&amp;quot;, which is typically more trouble than it's worth).<br>
<br>
Summons don't suffer from wounds.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Fatigue<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Summons do not have Fatigue levels, as such, though they still make
Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and accumulate penalties to those
rolls, normally. Instead, whenever a summon fails a Fatigue roll its
penalties reset normally and it automatically loses 20% of its maximum
Vitality.<br>
<br>
This is part of representing how, as discussed in Damage, summons
disappear once they're no longer able to fight: it doesn't really
matter if they're worn out by overexertion or by being beaten on too
heavily, one way or another they're not able&nbsp; to go on.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Unsummoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
If you are ever in a position where you want to unsummon one of your
summoned things, all it takes is a Speed 5 action and poof! You can
unsummon any single summon, or even multiple summoned things all at
once.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
## Bird Contract<br>
<br>
In many ways, summoned birds are closer to their natural kin than most
of the other chakra-enhanced summon animals. Few of them speak human
languages, and in most cases they are being called upon to do something
birds already would, just quicker and more effectively.<br>
<br>
As a species, birds ard neither friendly nor kind--but neither are they
malicious or dismissive. They're proud, but willing to respect anyone
who will afford them the same. While they are be no mean pacifists or
even averse to violence, they are not, as a whole, particularly
well-suited to combat, which is enough for many ninja to steer away
from them.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, they can be quite useful in other ways, in no small
part because they can fly. Additionally, many of the summoned birds
bear a stronger resemblance to their naturally-occurring brethren than
other summon animals do to theirs, which often allows summoned birds to
go unnoticed when other creatures wouldn't.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
Access<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### 800 XP: Flawless Messenger<br>
###### 1200 XP: Corpse Devouring Crows<br>
###### 1600 XP: Summon: Raven<br>
###### 2000 XP: Summon: Owl<br>
###### 2400 XP: Graceful Sky Emissary<br>
###### 4500 XP: Summon: Amahaou<br>
###### 6000 XP: Summon: Garuda&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## Techniques<br>
### --( Kanzen Shisha - Flawless Messenger )--<br>
This summons a small to medium-sized bird, though not a bird of prey.
The bird will accept a written message from its summoner, wait to be
told where to delier that message to, and then fly off to deliver it.<br>
<br>
For obvious reasons, these birds are quite popular with ninja who use
the bird-summoning contract: they make excellent, efficient, and
precise messengers, with almost no risk of being intercepted, and none
at all of being bribed, subverted, or double agents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The bird will accept an envelope, a small scroll, or sheets of paper.
After taking the message, it will wait until you instruct it where that
message should be delivered, which can be any person you know or place
you've been.<br>
<br>
The bird will then fly off. If in combat, it flies 5 yards per IC for
the first 100 IC, and can't be targeted by anything with a range of
less than 20. After that, the speed increases to 10 yardsper IC and it
can't be reached by anything with a range of less than 100 yards.
(Other flying enemies, however, have no such restrictions on attacking
them)<br>
<br>
Out of combat, the bird flies at 30 miles an hour. If it's attacked, it
has +25 dodge, and can take only 50 damage before being unsummoned. If
it was sent with a handwritten message, the message will disappear with
it; anything else (such as a sealed scroll) will be dropped.<br>
<br>
The bird will, after circling aimlessly for a while, fly towards its
specified destination. Attempting to follow the bird is impossible from
the ground. If it cannot reach the intended recipient (because they're
dead, or in a jail cell with no windows, for example) it will come as
close as it can, wait around for a week, and then disappear.<br>
<br>
One of this technique's downsides is that there's no way for the
summoner to tell if the message was delivered successfully.
Furthermore, it may only be used once every month (4 OOC days).<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Shitai Musabori no Karasu - Corpse Devouring Crows )--<br>
A rarely-used aspect of the bird-summoning contract, though one that's
seen a fair deal of popularity among the ANBU corps of various
villages, it summons (despite its name) a murder of crows, a wake of
vultures, or group of other appropriate carrion-eating bird.<br>
<br>
The birds will swarm the area, devouring any recently-dead bodies
without leaving a single trace of their passing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + 3 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The birds will completely consume 1 + X human-sized corpses (or
multiple smaller corpses, or part of a lower number of larger corpses)
in a matter of minutes. The birds are incredibly thorough, and will
leave absolutely no trace of the individual behind, even cleaning up
any blood that hasn't had time to dry.<br>
<br>
Thus, if you brutally murdered someone in their bedroom, and got blood
all over the inside of the place, you could open a window and summon
the birds, who would make it look as if the murder never took place--as
long as the blood hadn't had time to dry and stain things. (Place might
still be a mess, though).<br>
<br>
The birds can be summoned indoors, but only if there's easy access to
the outdoors nearby; an open window or door, for example.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Yuugana Sukai-Shisha - Graceful Sky Emissary )--<br>
You summon a very large eagle or a giant hawk, which lifts you up and
carries you a short distance before leaving. While certainly very
showy, the situations where having a giant bird carry you only a short
distance is actually useful are fewer than one may think.<br>
<br>
Even so, it does have its uses, such as crossing chasms or otherwise
dangerous terrain. Also, the eagle will carry its summoner to solid
ground even if that would be beyond its normal range, so it's pretty
handy after getting thrown off a cliff.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25 + 5 * X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The eagle (or giant hawk) will pick up you and up to one other person
to carry, who must be within 5 yards of one another. You need to hold
on, which means that for the duration of the trip at least one of your
arms will be occupied at all times holding the eagle's legs.<br>
<br>
Also, worth noting: the eagle can actually support the weight of about
four people, so one common trick is to have two ninja hold onto the
backs of two others, and then summon the eagle to carry each pair.<br>
<br>
The eagle flies up 4 + X - Y yards per IC, up to a maximum of 6. Y is
the number of people the eagle is carrying. Once it drops its
passengers off, it is unsummoned. The eagle will cary its passengers
for up to 50 IC (or until told it reaches the summoner's destination).
If it isn't over solid ground at that point, it will fly to the nearest
safe location before dropping them off. On the other hand, if the
summoner asks it to drop them in mid-air it will do
so.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>

## Summon: Raven<br>
1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
3. Attributes<br>
4. Abilities<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ravens are known to be exceptionally intelligent for birds, able to
create tools and recognize faces, and summoned ravens are even more so.
Most subspecies are hard to differentiate, and so they seldom look out
of place when flying over an area.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Despite being very clever, ravens don't talk. Or, it might be accurate
to say they don't speak.<br>
<br>
They are able to communicate ideas to their summoner. After returning
from scouting, it will perch somewhere the summoner can see it (on a
tree stump, on a forearm if one is offered, and so forth) and begin
tilting its head, pecking aimlessly with its peak, and shifting from
side to side. Anyone looking at it will be able to tell it's doing
something unusual, but the summoner will actually understand what it's
&amp;quot;saying.&amp;quot;<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Vitality: 200<br>
&lt;br&gt; STR: 10<br>
&lt;br&gt; RES: 10<br>
&lt;br&gt; CHA: 10<br>
&lt;br&gt; DEX: 40<br>
&lt;br&gt; AGI: 50<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt;Accuracy: 30<br>
&lt;br&gt;Dodge: +20<br>
&lt;br&gt;Movement: 5 yards per IC<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt;Awareness: +20<br>
&lt;br&gt;Espionage: +25<br>
&lt;br&gt;Stealth: +30<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Enhanced Vision<br>
Ravens ignore bonuses to Stealth TNs based on Stealth level. For
example, if someone was in Stealth 3 with a Stealth TN of 45, it would
be treated only as 30 for the raven (as it ignores the +15 from Stealth
3).<br>
<br>
###### Independent Action<br>
The raven can act competently without guidance from its summoner. None
of its actions require AP to perform, and when given general
instructions (&amp;quot;scout the area&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;see if you can find any clues&amp;quot;) it will do
so to the best of its ability.<br>
<br>
###### Flight<br>
By default, the raven is airborne; it may land or take off as a Speed
10 action. When airborne, it cannot be targeted by any attacks with a
range of less than 100 yards. After descending to Steal (see below) an
item, it is effectively 0 yards from the ground; it regains 3 yards of
altitude every IC. Melee attacks can reach it only if the attacker can
move (i.e. jump) far enough to reach the raven as part of their attack.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions<br>
Ravens may use Dodge and Move as described in the Combat chapter of the
PHB.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Scout (Speed N/A)<br>
The raven leaves to scout the area. Depending on the radius of the area
it's told to scout, how long it will take varies.<br>
25 yards: 30 seconds<br>
50 yards: 2 minutes<br>
100 yards: 5 minutes<br>
200 yards: 10 minutes<br>
The raven will make an Awareness check against everyone and everything
in the area. It will then report back to its summoner. It can
communicate basic concepts, such as number and location of people;
presence of buildings, carriages, and obvious traps; and so forth. It
can make basic guesses about people based on their appearance: a group
of four people leaping through trees are probably ninja, the people
working in the rice fields are probably farmers, and so forth. It
requires a break of at least twice as long as it spent scouting before
it will go scout the area again.<br>
<br>
###### Spy (Speed N/A)<br>
After finding something while scouting, or given instructions by its
summoner (like, &amp;quot;wait here&amp;quot;), the raven will
go to an area and do something appropriately bird-like, such as
perching nearby or pecking at the ground. It will wait there until a
condition, specified by the summoner is met, then fly back and alert
its summoner. A good example would be, &amp;quot;Go watch the group
you saw camped out in the woods, let me know if any of them
leave.&amp;quot; Anyone being spied upon for more than two minutes
can make an Awareness roll against the raven's Espionage to realize
that it's behaving unnaturally for a bird.<br>
<br>
###### Steal (Speed 15)<br>
Ravens may pick up any small, unattended objects, or minor things like
shiny buttons on people's coats or lightweight pieces of headgear. If
instructed by their summoner, they can go for specific items; if not,
they'll pick up whatever is most useful (a discarded kunai to let their
summoner know that ninja are ahead, for example) or, failing that,
shiniest. Stopping the raven from stealing something requires an
Awareness roll (to notice it) and then an Accuracy roll against its
accuracy (to grab the item before it can), both of which are allowed of
anyone within 10 yards of whatever it's trying to steal.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
When summoned, the raven will stay around until the next time the sun
sets (in other words, the rest of the day) or until it's badly injured
enough to be unsummoned.<br>
<br>
If dispatched by being injured, another raven cannot be summoned for
two months (8 OOC days). If dismissed at sundown or by the summoner, it
can be called once a week (OOC day) as normal.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

2. Behavior<br>
3. Attributes<br>
4. Abilities<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
A large forest owl, about two feet 'tall' from its talons to the top of
its head when perched, with alert yellow-orange eyes. The owl is quite
wise, and moderately eccentric. It's also the only summonable bird
(aside from the avatar) which can speak to humans.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25 + X * 3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
The owl can only be summoned in areas where it can reach the open sky
(so, not in caves), and will only come if there's somewhere it can
perch above eye level for its summoner (such as a tree branch or the
top of a short pole). However, this location must still be close enough
for casual conversations, without it or the summoner having to raise
their voices.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
If the owl's summoner deliberately tries to &amp;quot;one
up&amp;quot; it by going higher or growing larger than the owl is
high, it becomes offended and flies away.<br>
<br>
Unlike most birds, the owl is capable of speaking human language. It
actually claims that most of the other summoned birds can, but choose
not to (the validity of this claim is dubious at best). It has a
soft-spoken, cultured manner of speaking, though it avoids sounding
pretentious or trying to talk over the head of its summoner
(figuratively; literally, it certainly does so).<br>
<br>
Beyond its curious fixation on having the highest elevation in any
situation it finds itself in, the owl is quite agreeable and helpful,
if disconcertingly prone to turning its head upside-down or in a full
circle when talking.<br>

<br>
###### Busy<br>
The owl will perform a total of X actions (from Abilities) before
leaving. This can be the same action multiple times. Standard Actions
do not count.<br>
<br>
###### Flight<br>
By default, the owl will find somewhere to perch; it may take off or
land as a Speed 10 action. When airborne, it altitude automatically
increases by 3 yards every IC, to a maximum of 100 yards. It cannot be
targeted by any attacks with a range of less than its altitude. Melee
attacks can reach it only if the attacker can move (i.e. jump) far
enough to reach the owl as part of their attack. After using its
Distract or Disarm actions it is considered 0 yards from the ground,
and will then regain altitude accordingly.<br>
<br>
###### Night Vision<br>
Owls ignore all darkness-based visibility penalties.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Standard Actions<br>
Owls can use Move, Dodge, and Search.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Disarm (Speed 10, 6 AP)<br>
The owl swoops down and tries to grab something an enemy is holding,
then fly away with it! The enemy defends against this as if it was a
normal disarm attempt. If they fail, the owl takes whatever weapon they
had and flies up with it. The owl will drop it 15 IC later, at which
point it can be retrieved.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Distract (Speed X, 5+X/2 AP)<br>
The owl flies around someone's face, generally being a nuisance! This
imposes a -4 visibility penalty on the person being distracted due to
the large bird flapping in front of their face and making obnoxious
hooting noises.<br>
<br>
This penalty lasts for X IC, or until the owl takes at least 100
damage. It can also be broken prematurely by moving 20 yards or more in
5 IC or less (by simply getting away from the owl). Until the
Distraction ends (for any of those reasons), the owl will not regain
altitude.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Erudite (N/A)<br>
You may ask the owl to make a Research roll for you on any topic,
either in place of making one yourself or in hopes of getting a better
result than you did with your own roll. It can also make
knowledge-based Medicine or Toxicology rolls (though please don't try
asking the owl to perform first aid on someone--it never ends well).<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Knowledge (N/A)<br>
Owls are quite the impressive scholars (apparently), even about matters
related to ninja. After seeing any jutsu used, or even hearing it
described by someone who saw it, it can identify the technique and all
pertinent information about it (rank, effects, possible workarounds,
and so forth). The same applies to the abiliies of any ninja clans and
bloodlines. Each technique it's asked about counts as one use of this
ability, each clan counts as two.<br>
<br>
Note that for clans, it will provide general information:
&amp;quot;Yamanaka can enter the minds of their enemies and control
their actions, but the damage to the possessed individual carries over
to the original body,&amp;quot; for example. It would not provide
an exhaustive breakdown of evey ability possessed by the clan, unless
each was asked as a separate question (requiring the summoner to have
at least enough familiarity with the techniques to describe them to the
owl).<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Scout (Speed 0, 10 AP)<br>
The owl will scout an area for its summoner. Out of battle this has no
Speed or AP cost, takes 10 minutes, and covers an area with a 100 yard
radius. The owl will report back with what it found (it makes an
Awareness roll against everyone and everything in the area).<br>
<br>
Used in combat, it uses the listed Speed and AP and attempts to find a
hidden enemy. It will continually perform Search actions until the
enemy (or enemies) it was asked to find are discovered or break
stealth. Once it finds them, it will, as a Speed 0 action, Point Out
whoever it found (as per the rules in Combat -&amp;gt; Stealth).<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Normally, the owl can be called once every two weeks. If involved in
combat at all, it cannot be summoned again for four weeks. If injured,
this is raised to six; and if it loses all its Vitality, it cannot be
summoned again for three months (12 OOC days).&lt;/text&gt;<br>

1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
3. Attributes<br>
4. Abilities<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Sky Kings, as they are called, are tremendous snow-white eagles with
wingspans of several hundred feet, capable of shadowing battlefields
when they fly overhead. Each of their feathers is as long as a person
is tall, and they're strong enough to trivially lift up the largest of
(mundane) land animals. Of all the known summon creatures, they are by
far the physically largest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 35<br>
<br>
The Amahaou can only be summoned outdoors, in areas large enough for it
to spread its wings and take flight.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
As is the case with most summoned birds, Sky Kings cannot speak any
language that humans will understand. Even so, they have at least
human-level intelligence and can understand complex requests and plans.
While it would not be accurate to call them friendly, they willingly
have a helpful disposition.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;BR&gt; Vitality: 6000<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; STR: 160<br>
&lt;br&gt; RES: 200<br>
&lt;br&gt; CHA: 100<br>
&lt;br&gt; DEX: 120<br>
&lt;br&gt; AGI: 100<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Accuracy: 50<br>
&lt;br&gt; Dodge: N/A<br>
&lt;br&gt; Damage Bonus: 14<br>
&lt;br&gt; Movement: 6 yards per IC<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Awareness: +30<br>
&lt;br&gt; Resistance: +25<br>
&lt;br&gt; Stealth: Yeah, no.<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Bird of Prey<br>
Any time an enemy in Stealth moves within a Sky King's shadow (see
&amp;quot;Shade&amp;quot;), it automatically sees them
regardless of their current Stealth level or Stealth TN. Making any
attack, even a ranged weapon attack, from stealth while in its Shade is
also enough motion to draw its attention this way.<br>
<br>
###### Buffet<br>
Whenever a Sky King attacks, everyone within its Shade other than the
target must make an Athletics roll against a TN of 30 or be immediately
Tripped, and Stunned for the next 6 IC.<br>
<br>
###### Flight<br>
Unless they deliberately land (doing so, and taking off again, are both
Speed 15 actions), Sky Kings are always considered airborne, and as
such ignore effects dependant upon the condition of the ground. When
they attack, they are considered to be at ground level. Every IC which
bases after they take off or attack, they rise 5 yards straight up, to
a maximum of 100 yards. Any attack from the ground must have sufficient
range to hit them; melee attacks can be used as long as the attacker
can travel that far as part of their attack (by jumping!).<br>
<br>
###### Great Bird<br>
The area beneath a Sky King in flight is subjected to heavy gusts of
wind every time it beats its wings. Within that area (see
&amp;quot;Shade&amp;quot;) every time the IC reaches a multiple
of 20 all clouds (such as from Mist Blaze Dance, or Hidden Mist
Technique) are removed.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Titanic<br>
Amahaou cannot dodge area-of-effect attacks; instead, they
automatically block them as a Speed 0 defense. Amahaou cannot hide.
Multi-throws inflict half damage to an Amahaou. Amahaou are too large
to be affected by any jutsu or effects that work by binding or
physically immobilizing them. They cannot be grappled by any enemies
who are not Huge or larger.<br>
<br>
A Sky King cannot dodge any attack with a range greater than its
current altitude. This means that it is completely unable to dodge any
attack with a maximum range of greater than 100 yards (its maximum
atitude). This does mean that it cannot dodge while on the ground.<br>
<br>
Attempting to parry the Amahaou's attacks requires either a Strength of
100 or more, or an unarmed physical damage bonus of 10 or greater, as
well as both hands free.<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Shade<br>
When in flight, an Amahaou is considered to occupy an area with a 100
yard radius centered on its &amp;quot;actual&amp;quot;
location; anyone in that area is effectively in melee range of it (not
counting distance from the ground). Anyone below it is immune to any
weather-based effects caused by thunderstorms, rain, and so forth.<br>
<br>
###### Talons<br>
A Sky King may grab up to two individuals, one in each claw. It suffers
no penalties for being in control of the grapple. Enemies using the
Escape Grapple technique have the Speed, Delay, and Stamina cost
doubled.<br>
<br>
###### Tireless<br>
###### An Amahou does not need to make Stamina rolls for its actions.
If forced to for other reasons (such as Suffocation), it uses +25 for
its effective bonus to Fatigue rolls.<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions<br>
Amahaou may use Move and Search.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Crush (Speed 12, 10 AP)<br>
Usable while on the ground.<br>
This may only be used while someone is Pinned by the Amahaou. It deals
(damage), which is doubled for the purposes of inflicting (Blunt)
wounds, and applies a Suffocation 2 each time it's used.<br>
Crushing cannot be avoided, and deals no base damage. However, it uses
double the Amahaou's standard damage bonus for determining its damage
dealt (making it, under normal circumstances, 14*2*10 = 336 damage,
raised to 672 for inflicting wounds).<br>
<br>
###### Peck (Speed 20, 16 AP)<br>
Usable while on the ground.<br>
It's not actually a peck. It's actually a bite from a titanic bird's
equally oversized beak. If this wounds a victim it inflicts both a
Blunt (from the crushing force) and Slashing (from... being bitten)
wound of the appropriate severity. It deals 20d20 damage, but has a -5
Accuracy penalty. If used against a Pinned opponent, this hits
automatically.<br>
<br>
###### Pin (Speed 14, 20 AP)<br>
Usable while in flight.<br>
The Amahou simultaneously lands and attacks a single target. If they're
hit they must immediately make an Athletics roll against 35 or be
Grappled by one of its talons. During this period they're prone and
unable to form handseals. The Amahaou may not move without ending the
grapple. Even after escaping, whoever was Pinned is prone, as if by the
Trip taijutsu.<br>
<br>
###### Pluck (Speed 20, 15 AP)<br>
Usable while in flight.<br>
The Amahaou swoops down and snatches up an unfortunate victim. This may
target up to two people within its Shade at once, as a single action.
People grabbed this way are treated as if held by the E-rank Grab
taijutsu. Escaping the grapple results in one falling 5 yards per IC
(because calculating actual acceleration due to gravity would not be
worth the effort). For every yard they were above 20 when they escaped,
they take 1d12+1 damage when they hit the ground. Falling inflicts
Blunt wounds. The Amahaou may also drop one or both of the people it's
holding, as a (Speed 10, 5 AP) action.<br>
<br>
###### Rake (Speed 24, 10 AP)<br>
Usable while in flight.<br>
The Amahou rakes with its claws. It may choose up to two areas ten
yards across within its Shade to attack. This attack targets everyone
within both those areas, though is not treated as an area-of-effect
attack. This deals 4d8*10 damage to anyone it hits.<br>
<br>
###### Scratch (Speed 16, 10 AP)<br>
Usable on the ground.<br>
The Amahaou scratches an area within 20 yards with one of its claws.
This targets everyone in an area 10 yards across, though is not treated
as an area-of-effect attack. It deals 4d6*10 damage to anyone hit by
the attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
An Amahaou can only be summoned once every three months (12 OOC days).<br>
<br>
When one is summoned, it will either aid the summoner in combat, or
allow itself to be used as an aerial ferry. In the latter case, it will
do so until sunset or sunrise, whichever comes first. It will carry
additional passengers, if the summoner wishes.<br>
<br>
Due to the Sky King's immense size, falling off isn't much of an
issue--a large portion of its back is essentially
&amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; when in flight, and its feathers are
sturdy enough to easily be used as handholds. Climbing down can be
tricky, but not, in most cases, dangerous.<br>
<br>
Once either of those is accomplished, it will depart--it will not help
fight off enemies and then carry its summoner to safety, nor will it
stay around and help fight after delivering its somewhere where they
need to go... unless it's attacked, in which case it will defend itself
mercilessly.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

# Avatar Summon: Garuda<br>
1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
3. Attributes<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The avatar of the birds, the legendary Lord Garuda, takes the form of a
bird of no clear species: an eagle-like body structure, an owlish face,
a pure-white raven's beak, and the claws of a falcon. His plumage is
similarly unique, brilliant gold feathers along his leg, a
red-feathered body crossed with gold bands, white tailfeathers, a
golden crest, and vibrant blue pinion feathers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 40<br>
<br>
Physically, Garuda is much less imposing than any of the sky kings,
though he is still quite large, with a wingspan over a hundred feet
across. He's not as large as some of the avatar summons, but he's
certainly large enough to dwarf any summoner.<br>
<br>
Garuda can speak--or, rather, Garuda can 'speak'. When he does so it is
in a soft-spoken, deep, noble voice which is heard in the minds of
everyone who he wishes to hear him. He does not talk in the
conventional sense, making no actual noise. In short, it's telepathy,
or something very much like it.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Garuda is calm, even-tempered, and noble. He is righteous, but not
kind. He will willingly lend his aid to those who need it for a just
cause, but will be reluctant to aid individuals who are merely seeking
to advance their own interests or use his power for their personal
benefit.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
As the avatar of birds Garuda is without equal in the sky, capable of
flying with breathtaking grace. He is undoubtedly a fierce combatant,
though likely lacks the raw power of some of the larger, land-bound
animal avatars.<br>
<br>
Legends claim that Garuda himself is genuinely divine to some measure,
though what the implications of this may be are
unknown.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Canine Contract<br>
Ever since they were domesticated from feral wolves, dogs have been
known as one of mankind's most faithful companions. Even ordinary,
non-shinobi dogs are fiercely loyal to their masters, and in Konoha
there's an entire clan dedicated to the rearing of shinobi dogs.<br>
<br>
This contract summons a variety of different dogs. The lowest ranks
(the ninken; literally &amp;quot;ninja dogs&amp;quot;) are in
fact groups of dogs trained in the ninja arts that are loyal to a small
group of people. Each major village usually has a few teams of ninken
loyal to them, and even the minor villages typically have their own
team.<br>
<br>
The two dog spirit summons are literally that: incorporeal spirits,
perhaps even ghosts, of dogs. Despite their rather unsettling nature,
they are, like the ninken, very helpful and loyal summons, willing to
engage in combat or assist as necessary when working towards their
summoner's goals.<br>
<br>
That changes at the higher ranks of the contract. The
&amp;quot;Mountain Dogs&amp;quot; would be better known as
giant wolves. They, and the canine avatar Oguchi-no-Makami, are
anything but trusting or subservient. By signing the contract, the
summoner has in effect become a member of their pack.<br>
<br>
With the dogs, the summoner is their master; with the wolves, the
summoner is a lowly member of their pack. The wolves will fight to
defend their pack, viciously and to the death if necessary, but that
pack member had best remember their place.<br>

<br>
## Techniques<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Tsuiga no Jutsu - Summoning: Tracking Fang Technique
)--<br>
Summoning all 8 of their Ninken team, the shinobi uses a bit of their
own blood to give the dogs a scent trail. Following the scent, the team
dives underground and travels to its target. Once there they burst up
from the earth and bite down on the target, keeping them immobilized
for a short while.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Before this technique can be used, you need to get some of your own
blood onto the target. This can be accomplished one of two ways. The
first, if your opponent has damaged you with a piercing or slashing
weapon and is still carrying it, there will be enough blood on it.
Alternately, you can cut your hand with a slashing weapon as a Speed 4
action that deals 10 points of damage (which cannot be reduced) to
yourself. After doing so, you have 25 IC to hit your target with a
basic unarmed attack; if it takes longer than that, you need to cut
yourself again.<br>
<br>
Once an enemy has blood on them, Tracking Fang can be used; your ninken
team appears by you and dives underground. They will attack your target
X/2 IC later, where X is the number of yards that target is from you;
if they move away, the time until the dogs attack is increased, but no
matter what the ninken team will eventually find them. No penalties
other than Fatigue are applied to your Accuracy with this technique.
Similarly, you can use this against someone who you can't see (because
they're in stealth) as long as they've been marked. Being hit by
Tracking Fang will immediately remove a stealthed individual from
stealth.<br>
<br>
When the dogs do attack, it is defended against as if it was whatever
Speed this technique was when you performed it. If it hits, the target
suffers a -8 immobilization penalty, and you and they both roll
Survival. The penalty lasts for 2 IC for every point you beat their
Survival roll by, with a minimum of 10 IC.<br>
<br>
If the victim takes a total of 300 or more points of area-of-effect
damage (before reductions), the effect ends immediately, and all of
your ninken are unable to be summoned for four weeks (as discussed in
Summons -&amp;gt; Ninken -&amp;gt; Terms of Contract).<br>
\page<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Inugami - Summoning: Dog Spirit )--<br>
The Inugami is said to be created by the death of a starving dog buried
up to its neck and left to die with food just out of reach. As the myth
goes, the spirit will then serve its former master, but at times will
remember how its life ended and turn upon whoever bound it to that fate.<br>
<br>
Whether or not there's any truth in that story, the canine contract
does provide the ability to summon these spirits. They look like
elongated, white-bodied dogs with brown heads and paws. They don't
speak, and aren't affectionate by any means, but will serve the shinobi
who summoned them faithfully. After being called it flies towards its
unfortunate victim and vanishes into their body.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 12<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Choose a single target to be cursed by the Inugami. While cursed, the
target suffers a -3 penalty to Accuracy and their d20 rolls. This
includes Accuracy, defenses, skill rolls, and Stamina and Chakra
Exhaustion--but not damage for attacks which roll d20s for damage.<br>
<br>
This penalty lasts until the target rolls a natural 15 or higher on one
of their affected d20 rolls, at which point the curse is broken. If
they roll a natural 20 while affected by the curse, it is instead
reflected upon the shinobi who summoned the Inugami, who must then
break it by the normal means. (If they in turn roll a natural 20, it is
once more reflected upon the victim, until someone breaks it without
rolling a 20).<br>
<br>
Notably, there is no defense against this curse; it cannot be dodged,
blocked, or so on.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Inugami Hyoukyo - Dog Spirit Possession )--<br>
Not only is the Inugami able to curse an enemy but it can also take
over a person's body. Ordinarily, this is incredibly difficult to do;
however, if a shinobi wishes it they may willingly give themselves over
to possession by the Inugami. While ordinary people possessed by an
Inugami begin to act like dogs themselves, shinobi are able to stave
off the worst of that.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20+2*X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The severity of any Bleed, Paralysis, and Poison effects you are
suffering from is reduced by X for the duration of the possession. If
this reduces a Poison to 0, it will not automatically negate any other
effects of that poison. Every 10 IC you recover X Hit Points, or X
Vitality if you aren't missing any Hit Points.<br>
<br>
Any time you take an action and roll a 5 or less on a d20, you suffer
from a Stun 5 effect after the action is completed, as you must
struggle to maintain control of your mind and not succumb to the
spirit's canine instincts.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Each of the ninken teams has a distinct uniform signifying their
village orientation, and yes, dogs wearing forehead protectors or
shirts with village insignia does look ridiculous. From there, each of
the 8 dogs is usually of a breed that would be well suited to their
chosen specialty. The ninken teams seem to be separated by village and
also by generations. What this means is that the team of ninken your
grandpa summoned are not the ones you're going to be summoning. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra:15 + X * 3 + Y * 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
&amp;quot;X&amp;quot; is the number of Ninken you are summoning
at once, and &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot; is the number of times you
have used Kuchiyose no Jutsu to summon your ninken in the past week
(OOC day).<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ninken are some of the most loyal of all summons, and in most cases are
happy to help their summoners. Even if mildly abused, the ninken will
continue to do what their summoners ask.<br>
<br>
They're talking dogs that use ninja skills, what's not to love?!<br>
<br>
No ninken are poodles, chihuahuas, or other small, annoying, yappy dogs.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Vitality: 600<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; STR: 50<br>
&lt;br&gt; RES: 50<br>
&lt;br&gt; CHA: 30<br>
&lt;br&gt; DEX: 50<br>
&lt;br&gt; AGI: 50<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Accuracy: 21<br>
&lt;br&gt; Dodge: +11<br>
&lt;br&gt; Damage Bonus: 3.3<br>
&lt;br&gt; Movement: 2 yards per IC.<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Athletics: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Awareness: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Chakra Control: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Espionage: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Resistance: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Stealth: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Survival: +15<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Ninja Training<br>
Despite not having enough Chakra Control, each of the Ninken has the
equivalent of the abilities Wall Walking and Water Walking. <br>
<br>
###### Tireless<br>
Ninken do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when they
act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have
+5 to their rolls.<br>
<br>
###### Tracking Fang Technique<br>
If the shinobi uses the Tracking Fang Technique jutsu while one or more
ninken are present on the battlefield, they will all burrow
underground. They are effectively removed from combat until the end of
that technique's duration, at which point they return to fight
normally. Rather than immediately un-summoning themselves after taking
300 damage (as would be normal for Tracking Fang), they take damage
normally (though taking that much damage will still end Tracking Fang,
as discussed in its effects).<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions (Speed as normal)<br>
This Summon may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat
chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Bite (Speed 10, AP 6)<br>
The standard method of attack for a canine is the bite and takedown,
something they've been doing for millenia. Attacking at the feet and
legs, this counts as a basic unarmed attack and inflicts 4d10 Blunt
damage. If the canine succeeds by 5 or more, it can make a automatic
grapple check. If the canine wins the grapple check, the opponent does
not suffer the normal penalties for being grabbed, but may break free
using the normal methods; the main purpose of this is enabling use of
the Takedown ability (below).<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Takedown (Speed 6, AP 8)<br>
After getting a good bite down on an opponent, the canine gives a good
shake and tug, aiming to drag their target down to the ground. This can
be used while the canine is grappling a foe, make a grapple check, if
succesful the target is knocked prone and still trapped in the grapple.
A prone person has -3 accuracy, -2 to defensive actions, and moves at
reduced speed (check grapple, or half if the canine loses the grapple).<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Track (Speed 20, AP 5)<br>
The canine uses their superior senses, usually those of smell, to track
down their quarry. This uses a survival roll with a +5 bonus to follow
tracks towards a target. The difficulty of the check is based on the
conditions. A standard non-ninja requires only a 15 to track. A shinobi
normally requires a 20, but if they are trying to cover their tracks
they get an opposed survival check, or a stealth check at -5. For each
day old the track is the difficulty to track increases by +2. Rain or
shifting ground conditions imposes a +5. Heavy rainfall, mudslides, or
tracking over running water imposes a +10.<br>
<br>
Used in combat, this is a Survival roll with a +5 bonus against the
Stealth TN of any hidden individuals. The dog may then Point Out
whoever they've found, as per the normal rules for that action.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. The Eight<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### The Leader<br>
The most charismatic of most Ninken teams, the leader can act without
using the summoner's AP. <br>
<br>
###### The Brute<br>
Called for when a little muscle is needed, the Brute has a STR of 90, a
Damage Bonus of 6.0, and a +5 bonus to grapple rolls.<br>
<br>
###### Bloodhound<br>
In addition to following tracks, the Bloodhound can also be given a bit
of blood from a bleeding target or a garment of clothing with the
target's scent to follow. Additionally, the bloodhound can use survival
instead of awareness to notice a target in stealth. The bloodhound has
a +10 bonus to its Survival rolls, and in combat does not need to spend
the summoner's AP to use its Track ability.<br>
<br>
###### Bombsniffer<br>
The Bombsniffer can use Survival to check for traps rather than
Awareness or Espionage, and has a +5 bonus to doing so. In addition, it
can sniff the remains of a detonated explosion and attempt to track the
one who prepared or detonated the explosive tags. <br>
<br>
###### Scout<br>
The Scout has an Awareness skill of +15. It may use the Search and
Point Out actions (as described in Chapter 3) without using any of the
summoner's AP. It uses Search as a Speed 4 action.<br>
<br>
###### Tiny<br>
The Tiny dog has a Stealth skill of +20, and can use its Bite attack
without breaking Stealth, though each time it does so its Stealth TN is
reduced by 5. It may use the Hide and Improve Hiding abilities as
described in Chapter 3, without spending any of the summoner's AP. It
can hide from anyone who is suffering from a -4 or greater visibility
penalty.<br>
<br>
###### Acrobat<br>
The Acrobat is fast and agile, having an Athletics skill of +15, a
movement speed of 3 yards per IC, and a dodge bonus of +16 (in place of
the normal +11, not on top of it).<br>
<br>
###### Spy<br>
The Spy is a master of disguise and manipulation, having an Espionage
skill of +15 and also the unique ability to use the ninjutsu art of
Henge no Jutsu, though doing so has a Chakra cost of 15, and it cannot
be maintained for more than half an hour.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
6. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The ninken are a very laid-back and devoted group of creatures, showing
extreme loyalty in most cases to their summoners. As such, they're
usually fine with whatever task needs to be done, unless the summoner
wants one of them to risk their life for the summoner's own material
gain.<br>
<br>
They're also one of the few summons that will fight other animals of
the same contract. Ninken will work against shinobi who've signed the
canine contract, and even other ninken teams, as long as they're from a
different village; a team of Sand ninken will have no problem fighting
a team of Leaf ninken and their master.<br>
<br>
That said, regardless of village affiliations the ninken will have
nothing to do with the Mountain Dogs or Oguchi-no-Makami. If either of
those are summoned into battle against them, the ninken will promptly
flee with their tails between their legs and unsummon themselves.<br>
<br>
Unlike most summons, you can also summon ninken repeatedly in the same
week (OOC day).<br>
<br>
If a dog has all its Vitality depleted, that particular ninken cannot
be summoned for four weeks. The Tracking Fang Technique cannot be used
if one or more of your dogs are recovering after such an
event.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Summon: Mountain Dogs<br>
1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
3. Attributes<br>
4. Abilities<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Mountain Dogs (or wolves, as westerners know them), are always
summoned in a pair. They appear as two giant wolves with grey coats and
white undersides. While they're capable of speaking, they prefer not
to, instead usually opting to growl their distaste. Unless the summoner
is considerably more powerful than them, they'll assertively bully
their own summoner around.<br>
<br>
The wolves' shoulders reach the height of a single-story building's
roof, and they're nearly thirty feet long from the nose to the tip of
their tail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
If the summoner has less than 5000 XP, the Mountain Dogs will view them
as a lower member of the pack and expect them to follow orders. At this
level they won't be willing to do much beyond protect the summoner; if
called on when the summoner isn't in genuine trouble or facing down
another summoned animal, it's unlikely that they'll help at all.<br>
<br>
If the summoner has 5000 to 6000 XP, the Mountain Dogs will view them
as barely an equal. They'll look for reasons to bully the summoner
around and nip at them in a show of dominance. They'll grudgingly speak
from time to time, but will avoid doing so more than they have to. At
this point the summoner is seen as a rival for dominance.<br>
<br>
Above 6000 XP, the Mountain Dogs are subservient, acknowledging the
summoner as the leader of their &amp;quot;pack.&amp;quot; They
still won't be quite as agreeable as the ninken, and will expect to be
treated reasonably well, but turnabout is fair play in terms of them
being bossed around.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Vitality: 2400<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; STR: 100<br>
&lt;br&gt; RES: 100<br>
&lt;br&gt; CHA: 100<br>
&lt;br&gt; DEX: 120<br>
&lt;br&gt; AGI: 100<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Accuracy: 35<br>
&lt;br&gt; Dodge: +25<br>
&lt;br&gt; Damage Bonus: 6.6<br>
&lt;br&gt; Movement: 10 yards per IC.<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Athletics: +20<br>
&lt;br&gt; Awareness: +25<br>
&lt;br&gt; Resistance: +20<br>
&lt;br&gt; Stealth: +30<br>
&lt;br&gt; Survival: +40<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Hamstring<br>
Whenever a mountain dog strikes someone with their Bite attack, that
person's movement speed is reduced by 5% for the next 20 IC. This
ability stacks with itself, up to a maximum of 10 times. All stacks of
Hamstring expire 20 IC after the most recently applied one. For
example, if you were hit by Hamstring 12 times, once every 10 IC, the
last time being on IC 123, you wuold be at -50% movement speed until IC
143. This does not stack with immobilization; whichever provides the
higher movement speed reduction overrides the other (though this has no
bearing in immobilization's accuracy and dodge penalties).<br>
<br>
###### Large<br>
Anyone of human size attempting to maintain control of a grapple with
the Mountain Dogs has a -10 penalty to their grapple rolls, and deals
only half damage.<br>
<br>
###### Pack Tactics<br>
Wolves excel at attacking as a group. Whenever anyone with the Pack
Tactics ability acts on the same initiative count and makes a
melee-range unarmed, any number of them may declare they are using Pack
Tactics. When using Pack Tactics, the target uses the Speed of the
slowest attack (that is, the one with the highest numerical Speed) to
determine which interrupts their target can use, but must defend
against each attack separately. The sum of the Speed of the defenses
that the target wishes to use must be valid to use against that speed.
For example, if both wolves attack with a Speed 10 Bite, the target's
defenses cannot have a total Speed greater than (10/2) 5. They could
dodge and parry, or dodge both, but two parries would be impossible
(Speed 3*2 = 6).<br>
<br>
###### Pack Membership<br>
The summoner of the Mountain Dogs gains the Pack Tactics ability as
long as at least one of the wolves remains in battle.<br>
<br>
###### Strength of Many<br>
The Mountain Dogs are able to fight more effectively alongside a worthy
summoner. They add (the summoner's unarmed taijutsu Accuracy bonus)/5
to their own Accuracy; this does not include the base 10, and ignores
Fatigue and status effects. Similarly, they add (the summoner's Dodge
bonus)/5 to their own Dodge bonus, with the same rules.<br>
<br>
###### Tireless<br>
Mountain Dogs do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls
when it act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation),
they have +15 to their rolls.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Standard Actions<br>
The Mountain Dogs can use the Dodge, Move, and Block actions as
described in Combat without spending any of the summoner's AP.<br>
<br>
###### Bite (Speed 10, AP 6)<br>
The preferred attack for a canine is the bite and takedown, something
they've been doing for millenia. Whereas a smaller dog would go for the
legs, the mountains wolves have no need to do so. A bite is a basic
unarmed attack inflicting 12d12 Blunt damage. If the attack hits by 5
points or more, it may automatically use its Takedown attack (see
below).<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Intercept (Speed 20, 15 AP)<br>
Wolves are already apex predators in their natural environments; the
summoned versions adapt most of the techniques they would use for
hunting prey when fighting their enemies. This may be used as an
Interrupt against anyone who's spent 10 or more of the last 20 IC
moving, with a range of (5)*(the number of IC the target spent moving
in the past 20 IC) yards. The wolf lunges for them, attempting to
simultaneously bite and tackle them. This deals 6d20 Blunt damage,
receives only half the Mountain Dog's damage bonus, and is an automatic
Surprise Attack. If it hits, it inflicts a Stun 12.<br>
<br>
###### Takedown (Speed +6, AP 4)<br>
After hitting with their bite attack by 5 points or more, the mountain
dog may attempt to savage its victim and throw them to the ground. This
requires an opposed grapple roll; if successful, the damage from Bite
is increased by 25% and the target is knocked prone as if by the E-rank
Trip taijutsu. Notably, this cannot be used against someone who's
already prone.<br>
<br>
###### Track (Speed 20, AP 5)<br>
The canine uses their superior senses, usually those of smell, to track
down their quarry. This uses a survival roll with a +5 bonus to follow
tracks towards a target. The difficulty of the check is based on the
conditions. A standard non-ninja requires only a 15 to track. A shinobi
normally requires a 20, but if they are trying to cover their tracks
they get an opposed survival check, or a stealth check at -5. For each
day old the track is the difficulty to track increases by +2. Rain or
shifting ground conditions imposes a +5. Heavy rainfall, mudslides or
tracking over running water imposes a +10. <br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The mountain dogs are feral wolves, and as such care nothing for the
world of ninja. Instead, they care only about their own pack and
territories. Generally speaking, they'll be only minimally inclined to
assist a summoner unless that shinobi's wishes align with their own.<br>
<br>
That said, if the summoner is in danger, they will generally rush to
their pack's defense. However, if the summoner bit off far more than
they could possibly handle, and should have (by the wolves' judgement)
realized that ahead of time, odds are the wolves will let them get what
they deserve. A member of the pack who is a detriment to its safety
will simply be left to fend for themselves.<br>
<br>
For other issues, it's a matter of needing a connection to pack or
territory. Protecting prospective mates, hunting grounds, prey, or
fellow 'pack members' (which is to say, allies) from assailants or
outside interference are all completely acceptable reasons to call on
the Mountain Dogs.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, asking them to show up to kill a random bystander or
an enemy who isn't worth their time, or to flaunt their power for the
summoner's sake, will typically earn the summoner a bite for their
insolence--and count as a Breach of Contract.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
## Summon Avatar: Oguchi-no-Makami<br>
<br>
1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Oguchi-no-Makami, the &amp;quot;True God of the Great
Mouth&amp;quot;, has a mythical status and is believed by some to
be a force of nature, or an incarnation of nature itself. Stories can
be found across the world of a giant wolf-spirit by that name guarding
an ancient forest. Of course, none can agree about the size of guardian
spirit, or which forest it's protecting, so most shinobi concur that
it's nothing more than a legend.<br>
<br>
Even so, there's at least one very real being by that name. Oguchi is a
giant white wolf, more than fifty feet tall at the shoulder and over a
hundred feet long. Lending some credence to the story, it's able to
maneuver forests (and cities, and similarly crowded areas) without
disturbing a single leaf, despite its incredible size. While Oguchi is
dwarfed by many of the other avatars in sheer size, it's still a
powerful creature, one that should not be underestimated.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 55<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Oguchi is fierce and powerful, bowing to no one. Its summoners are
members of its pack asking for help, not entitled masters calling it
into battle to serve them. Many summoners with this contract can report
Oguchi simply ignoring their attempts to summon it; the common
consensus is that he'll only appear when his
&amp;quot;pack&amp;quot; is in danger.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
&lt;img <br>
&nbsp;
src='https://dncache-mauganscorp.netdna-ssl.com/thumbseg/1235/1235276-bigthumbnail.jpg'
<br>
&nbsp; style='width:325px' /&gt;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
What exactly this constitutes is unclear, but summoning the Mountain
Dogs into battle before it is likely to help. As with all wolves,
Oguchi is quick to show dominance, and does not tolerate division among
the pack. Oguchi is quick to quell any disagreements, and always ready
to protect his (or is it her?) possessions.<br>
<br>
Yes, possessions: Oguchi considers both the land and his pack to be its
rightful property, and will fight savagely to protect
them.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
\page<br>
## Feline Contract<br>
<br>
The feline contract, to the chagrin of many a ninja, mainly involves
cats--as in, housecats. Not nearly enough panthers, tigers, lions, and
other great cats for most shinobi's tastes, and fewer still summonable
cats capable of holding their own, let alone turning the tide, in
battle between trained shinobi.<br>
<br>
In terms of personality, they're significantly more helpful than their
mundane counterparts. What they lack in useful supernatural abilities
they make up for with a startling array of mundane talents. While they
rarely make an appearance on the field of battle, shinobi with the
contract will consistently describe their feline companions as being,
if nothing else, 'useful'.<br>
<br>
That is not to say that the feline species have no combat-worth
specimens, just that the more powerful creatures who answer the
contract's call will come only for similarly powerful shinobi. Their
avatar, Byakko, is said to be feared even by the avatars of other
contracts.<br>
<br>
Felines have an interesting relationship with the summoned canines. The
two groups have quarreled frequently in the past, and it has without
exception escalated into a horribly violent mess. As such, the two
groups have established a truce: summoned felines and canines will
never attack or directly act against one another. The avatars of those
species, however, ignore this truce when it comes to their opposites;
Byakko and Oguchi-no-Makami have no qualms about fighting each other.<br>

## Techniques<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Airuu - Summoning: Feline Chef )--<br>
Between one and five felines, all the size of large housecats and
capable of walking both on all fours on bipedally, appear in front of
the summoning. All show up wearing a cooking apron, and one (the
leader) will show up with a small chef's hat.<br>
<br>
These cats are expert chefs, and capable of preparing excellent food
literally anywhere. When summoned they'll promptly run off to forage
for ingredients; how they can make a soup in the desert is a mystery,
and just what's in the stew is probably best not to ask, but their
meals are always nutritious and SO TASTY.<br>
<br>
Somehow they will always produce the supplies they need when people
aren't looking (or even so much as blink), from metal pots to grills to
firepits.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The feline chefs can be summoned up to three times a day (rather than
once a week, as with most summons). The chef will cook a delicious meal
for up to four people. However, the chefs absolutely do not take
suggestions or requests, and if anyone tries telling them what to make
they'll pack their things up and leave in a huff, not returning for a
week.<br>
<br>
It takes about half an hour for the cats to prepare the food; anyone
who isn't there waiting when the meal is finished doesn't get anything
to eat.<br>
<br>
Once a month (every 4 weeks), the summoner can inform the chefs that
it's a special occasion (the justification doesn't even need to be
reasonable, as the chefs love the excuse to go all out). The meal will
take a full hour to prepare, but will be a stunning gourmet feast.
While the shinobi who partake in the meal will be well-fed, this also
gives the head chef an excuse to experiment with dishes and seasonings
in ways that may not sit well with the stomachs of their diners--not
that they much care. After requesting a meal of this magnitude, one has
no choice but to eat every last bite.<br>
<br>
When eating the gourmet meal, roll 1d6 twice; the frst roll determines
the benefits, and the second the side-effects. The benefits all last
for one day (in-character day, that is), as do the side effects unless
their individual description specify otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Well-Fed<br>
1) Brain Food: You have a +3 bonus to all skill rolls, as you feel
charged and ready for anything.<br>
2) Complex Carbs: Your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls all have a
+4 bonus.<br>
3) Protein Power: For the next 8 hours, you deal +10% taijutsu damage. <br>
4) Sugar Rush: You are wired, giving you a +2 bonus to Accuracy and
defensive rolls.<br>
5) Surging Chakra: The 'secret ingredient' charged your energy
reserves, and your ninjutsu deals 10% more damage.<br>
6) Great Meal: Your Fatigue penalties are treated as being one level
lower until you reach Fatigue 3, at which point this benefit ends.<br>
<br>
###### Food Poisoning<br>
1) Double Vision: You suffer from a -2 visibility penalty for the next
day; everything's a bit blurry.<br>
2) Upset Stomach: You have Paralysis 1 for the rest of the day as you
wait for your stomach to recover.<br>
3) Woozy: You lose concentration for the next 2 hours, imposing a -3
penalty to Chakra Exhaustion rolls.<br>
4) Sweaty: You can't stop sweating, giving you a -3 penalty to all your
Stamina rolls.<br>
5 - 6) No downsides! You lucked out.<br>
<br>
<br>
When still feeling the effects of one such gourmet meal, an individual
will be too full to eat anything else.<br>

<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Shounin Neko - Summoning: Feline Merchant )--<br>
The feline summoned by this technique stands upright on its hind legs
and is about two and a half feet tall. It carries a cylindrical wicker
basket on its back, strapped around its waist and over its shoulders.
Its waist strap doubles a belt, where it has several money pouches.<br>
<br>
Occasionally these cats will wear some sort of outfits, usually just
consisting of a tunic and a shirt, though hats aren't entirely unheard
of. Normally these will display a pawprint somewhere on them,
prominently.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This summon has two tasks it can perform!<br>
<br>
The first, it can be called upon to run general errands around a town
or city. The cat will buy groceries and generally do any shopping you
need, assuming you provide it with appropriate funds. It can also
requisition items for you from ninja villages, before a mission! It can
be summoned to do this once a day.<br>
<br>
The second, it does a little bit of work as a merchant. You can 'sell'
any requisitioned items to it for half their value, and 'buy' any items
listed under &amp;quot;Gear&amp;quot; (which it produces from
its wicker basket full of knick-knacks). For example, you could trade
in two explosive tags (200), a katana (150), and a map of Wind Country
(50); this would allow you to buy up to 200 ryo of items from the
cat--a telescope, for example. This may be done once a week. Any more
often than that and the cat will have nothing but useless junk
available in its basket (some bits of string, a clawed-up piece of
fabric, and so on).<br>
<br>
Notably, it cannot provide you with poison smoke bombs--while the smoke
bombs themselves are in Gear, the necessary poisons are not.<br>
<br>
The cat cannot be summoned in battle, and flees if attacked.<br>
<br>

### --( Kuchiyose: Maneki Neko - Summoning: Lucky Cat )--<br>
This summons a ceramic figurine of a cat, standing about three or four
inches tall. It's a calico bobtail sitting on its hindquarters, with
one paw raised up in a beckoning gesture. These statues are said to
bring good luck, and are often found (albeit on larger scale) at the
entrance to shops and gambling halls.<br>
<br>
This particular one actually does bring good luck to its bearer! Or, so
the felines claim, and some of the few shinobi with this contract swear
by its efficacy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Whenever you roll a 5 or lower on a d20, your Maneki Neko receives 1
Luck Counter. It may have up to three Luck Counters stored at a time.<br>
<br>
You may spend a Luck Counter at any point to reroll any d20 roll you
made, or replace an attack's Accuracy with an accuracy roll, keeping
whichever of the results you prefer (typically the better one). This
may be done at the same time you would normally spend Willpower.<br>
<br>
You get no Luck Counters from rolls you rerolled this way. If you
rolled a 3 on a dodge, and spent a Luck Counter to reroll it and got a
2, you would not receive a Luck Counter (and would still spend one
normally). You may spend only one Luck Counter per roll.<br>
<br>
If the figurine is lost or stolen, you may not use its effects;
however, neither can whoever took it. Instead, whenever they roll a 15
or higher on a d20 they must reroll until they get a result below 15.
Getting rid of, or even breaking, the figurine won't do them any
good--as soon as they look away, it reappears in their possession,
until the technique would expire normally.<br>
<br>
This remains around for a full day, or the duration of a fight (if
summoned during, or immediately before, combat) or mission. You may
summon this figurine once every four weeks.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Akisu - Summoning: Cat Burglar )--<br>
Yet another bipedal cat, the Akisu is dressed in a black turtleneck,
beanie, and domino mask. The cat burglar requires payment up-front in
catnip, and once it's received its compensation the summoner names
their mark. After a moment of preparation the cat burglar gets to work,
and in hardly any time at all the summoner will receive a 'brand new'
item.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The cat moves unerringly towards its target, at the rate of 4 yards per
IC. Even if the target hides or moves outside of the initial range,
nothing will stop the cat, which flawlessly dodges all attacks and
crosses difficult terrain with ease! Well, almost nothing. It won't
cross areas with an Immobilization penalty of -8 or higher, and if it's
in a damaging area-of-effect technique with an Area of 30 or higher it
will be blown comically out of the blast radius before vanishing in a
puff of smoke. Though you must be able to see the target when you
summon the cat burglar, it willt hen be able to find them on their own
no matter what tricks they use; it will break the Stealth of someone
who hides from it, and clones created after the cat was summoned will
be unable to confuse it.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
Upon its arrival, the cat scampers up the victim and begins searching
their possessions! When this happens, roll 1d4. On a roll of 1-3, the
user selects one item the target has; on a roll of 4, the target makes
things difficult for the cat, resulting in it grabbing something less
valuable (meaning, the target chooses the item).<br>
<br>
The cat takes all items of that type; for example, all Maps, or all
Katanas. The only exception is that it cannot disarm its target. If
used against someone with Full Pockets, they cannot use their unique to
produce any more items of the stolen type until they have an
opportunity to resupply. The cat will even steal items inside Storage
Scrolls! It's a very, very good burglar, after all.<br>
<br>
It then returns to its summoner, following the same movement rules,
though this time an attack which manages to catch the cat in its area
results in the cat, after flying through the air yowling, hitting the
ground at its summoner's feet before vanishing. Upon arriving at its
summoner (one way or another), said summoner can take any items they
wish as a Speed X action, with X being the number of items, but having
a minimum of 5 (AP cannot reduce this action's Speed). Any excess items
are dropped on the ground.<br>
<br>
A cat carrying more than 10 items drops one every 8 yards it travels.<br>
<br>
<br>
Out of combat, the cat can be instructed to steal either from a person
or location, though needs fairly specific instructions (the guard's
keys, that painting, and so on).&lt;/text&gt;<br>

<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
A two- to three-foot-tall bipedal cat, much like the merchant and chef
cats summoned by this same contract. This one appears wearing simple
ninja attire, including a headband or bandana; they even wear forehead
protectors, with a feline pawprint in place of a village insignia.<br>
<br>
As the summoner trains and becomes a better ninja, so will 'their'
ninja cat! Over time the cat will expand its arsenal, wearing
handguards and a vest, along with holsters for shuriken and the like.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Yes, there really are cat ninjas. They all have impressive credentials,
such as being masters of neko-ken (&amp;quot;cat
fist&amp;quot;) style martial arts. While their efficacy in battle
leaves much to be desired, they do have the advantage of occasionally
debilitating opponents with laughter.<br>
<br>
A visual aid, for those having trouble picturing a ninja cat:<br>

<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Each summoner calls upon their own shinobi cat, who will be a faithful
companion in times of need. While handseals are out of the question,
these cats train diligently to master the shinobi arts in their
off-time!<br>
<br>

&lt;br&gt; Stealth: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Survival: +5<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Devoted<br>
Your cat trains (sort of) hard to remain a valuable ally in combat! As
your XP increases, so does its performance. The bonus movement speed is
calculated to one decimal point (as is its increased damage bonus, as
usual). The bonus to skill rolls only applies to skills the cat already
has.<br>
&nbsp; Accuracy, Dodge, Parry: (XP/200)<br>
&nbsp; Damage Bonus: (XP/500)<br>
&nbsp; Skill Rolls: (XP/250)<br>
&nbsp; Movement Speed: +(XP/1000) yards per IC<br>
&nbsp; Vitality: (XP/100)*10<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Independent<br>
Your ninja cat can act on its own. It does not require you to spend AP
for it to take actions unless the action itself specifies that it does.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Small<br>
If hit by an area-of-effect technique, the cat takes only half damage.
However, it is blown clear of the area (usually in an over-the-top, and
likely comedic, fashion), and suffers a knockback equal to the attack's
Area.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Ninja Training<br>
Shinobi cats train tirelessly in the ninja arts, up to two hours a day!
They'll work just hard enough to keep up with their summoner; any more
would simply be an unreasonable amount of effort. For every 500 XP,
pick one of the following improvements. You may not select any of them
more than once.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Armor: Your cat appears in appropriate
ninja-armor, such as handguards, a padded vest, and so forth. Whenever
it would take more than 25% of its maximum Vitality in damage from an
attack, that attack's damage is divided by 4.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neko-ken: Your cat has mastered martial arts! This
gives it a +4 bonus to any unarmed parries, and improves its Cat Paw
Strike action.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ninja Combatant: Your cat shows up with smoke and
flash bombs! It has (XP/750) of each, to a maximum of 5.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ninjutsu: Yes. It can perform ninjutsu, somehow.
Despite the cats referring to these as
&amp;quot;nyanton&amp;quot; techniques, they are actually
perfectly ordinary jutsu. The jutsu usable are explained below. The cat
can use 4+(XP/2000) ninjutsu per battle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick: Your cat is fast! It adds (XP/1000) to its
Accuracy, along with its dodge and parry rolls, to a maximum of +4.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Saboteur: Your cat shows up with a grappling hook,
rope, set of cat-sized lockpicks (with a +2 bonus, if it matters) and
(XP/1500) type 2 exploding tags.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shuriken: Your cat now shows up with holsters for
shuriken! This unlocks the &amp;quot;shuriken throw&amp;quot;
ability below. Your cat carries (XP/100) shuriken into battle with it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sword: It's more of a knife, really, considering
their size. But to them, it's a sword! Katanas are common, though some
will use combat knives or straight-bladed swords. This unlocks the
&amp;quot;sword attack&amp;quot; ability below.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions<br>
Ninja cats can use the dodge, parry, move, block, and hide actions, as
described in the Combat chapter of the PHB.<br>
<br>
###### Agility (Speed 0, 5 AP)<br>
This ability can be activated at any time, including after the cat is
attacked but before its defense has been declared. It ends any
immobilization penalties it's suffering from, and makes it immune to
that source (a specific instance of a jutsu, for example) from then on.
This does not apply to 'internal' penalties--ones caused by poison, for
example.<br>
<br>
###### Cat Paw Strike (Speed 10)<br>
Your cat punches, kicks, or occasionally claws, someone! This is a
basic unarmed taijutsu attack dealing 2d6 Blunt or Slashing damage. If
your cat has the Neko-ken attribute, this is reduced to Speed 6 and
adds a Stun 2, and its damage is raised to 4d8. Its damage bonus is
multiplied by 10, rather than 6, even at this lower Speed.<br>
<br>
###### Nyanjutsu (Speed Variable)<br>
The cat can perform various ninjutsu techniques after it has the
&amp;quot;ninjutsu&amp;quot; attribute. They are as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kawarimi (Speed +2): This is declared after the
cat is hit by a technique and partial defense applies; its dodge is
increased to speed 4 (and must remain a valid interrupt for this to be
used), and the cat dodges entirely, having left behind a wooden
figurine of a cat with its tongue stuck out in its place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bunshin (Speed 6): The cat creates three clones,
which follow the normal rules in the E-rank Bunshin ninjutsu, with the
following exceptions. The cat is always hidden amongst the clones, as
each clone is capable of attacking, though only one may act at a time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Henge (Speed 5): The cat may turn into any object
of approximately the same size, following the normal rules for the
E-rank Henge jutsu.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Genjutsu Kai (Speed 10): The cat may use this on
itself or its summoner.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shunshin no Jutsu (Speed 2): The cat may perform
this as if it had (XP/200) AP, a maximum of once every 20 IC.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Utsusemi (Speed 0): The cat can use this, for all
the good it does.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Shuriken Throw (Speed 4 + X)<br>
Your cat throws up to X shuriken. It may target up to X/4 people with
this attack (dealing full damage), receives +X/5 Accuracy, and
increases its damage bonus by X*0.2. X has a maximum of (XP/250). Cats
cannot use normal shuriken, only special shuriken crafted to be usable
by creatures without opposable thumbs (which they acquire via the
&amp;quot;Shuriken&amp;quot; attribute).<br>
<br>
###### Sword Attack (Speed 12)<br>
Your cat attacks with its sword! This does require the
&amp;quot;Sword&amp;quot; attribute. This weapon deals 8d10
Slashing damage, and follows normal rules for weapon attacks.
Additionally, it has a +3 bonus when being used to parry other weapons.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
One of the rare exceptions to the rule that summons of the same
contract will not work against one another, two ninja cats, if summoned
by enemies in a battle, will fight one another!&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Summon: Nekomata<br>

4. Abilities<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Legend says that once a cat has lived long enough its tail will split
in two and a nekomata will be born. Whether or not that's the origin of
these creatures is hard to say, but doubtful.<br>
<br>
Nekomata are slightly bigger than a very large housecat, and have the
features and coloration of any ordinary breed of cat, though grey and
black are the most common colors. They all posssess a pair of long,
sinuous tails, and commonly walk on air at face level. When not
actively moving about they tend to lounge on people's shoulders or
heads, often in the most awkward or uncomfortable way possible for the
recipient.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Nekomata are happy to assist in confusing and tormenting the summoner's
enemies. They're capable of deploying mirages and illusions with skill
rivaling most shinobi, taunting and frustrating their victims. That
said, they're much more cat-like than some of the contract's other
animals, and will typically refuse to perform menial tasks. Nekomata
are highly intelligent and can understand human languages, though
cannot speak them.<br>
<br>
If asked to engage in direct combat the cat will do so reluctantly, and
fight to the best of its ability. However, the summoner runs the risk
of it getting bored and leaving without any warning.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Vitality: 800<br>
&lt;br&gt; STR: 20<br>

&lt;br&gt; Damage Bonus: 4.0<br>
&lt;br&gt; Movement: 2 yard per IC<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Athletics: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Awareness: +15<br>
&lt;br&gt; Resistance: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Stealth: +20<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Chakra Exhaustion: +12<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Levitate<br>
The Nekomata is capable of floating, and spends most of its time
walking or sitting on empty air. It ignores any effects associated with
the condition of the ground, or requiring it to be in contact with it.<br>
<br>
###### Small<br>
The Nekomata is the size of a very large housecat. It takes half damage
of area-of-effect attacks, but any knockbacks its suffers are doubled.<br>
<br>
###### Trickster<br>
By raising their Chakra cost by 10, the Nekomata can replace its
genjutsu roll with 1d20, and the defender's roll with 1d20+4; this is
declared when an appropriate ability is being used. Uniques, abilities,
and doujutsu do not provide their normal benefits. The Iron Curtain
technique still works, and similarly the Nekomata receives any bonuses
specific to individual abilities it uses. Additionally, the Nekomata
itself is immune to any targeted genjutsu.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Cremation (Chakra 16, Speed 6, 4 AP)<br>
This applies an Ignite 1 to everyone present in battle, as pale blue,
ghostly flames briefly flicker over them.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Spirit Flame (Chakra 10 * X, Speed 14)<br>
The nekomata creates Xd4 wisps of hovering blue fire. You may pay 2 AP
to have the Nekomata launch one of these at a target, using its normal
Accuracy +3. After somebody's been hit by Spirit Fire, they can't be
targeted by it again until at least 5 IC have passed.<br>
<br>
Anyone struck by a Spirit Flame suffers Ignite 5 and Burns 3. Both
those statuses will stack with multiple uses of Spirit Fire, increasing
the victim's current severity (from this source) appropriately. By
raising the cost to attack with a flame to 5 AP, you may use your
Accuracy in place of the Nekomata's; you may do this no more than once
every 10 IC.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###### Phantasmal Flames (Chakra 16, Speed 10, 8 AP)<br>
This multiplies the number of Spirit Flames present by 1d4. Any
'extras' created this way are just illulsions. For example, if there
were 3 Spirit Flames, and you rolled a 3 on Illusionary Flames, you
would wind up with 3 real flames, and 6 illusions, for (3*3) 9 total.
If you use this ability again, it replaces (rather than adds to) any
currently-existing phantasmal flames.<br>
<br>
Whenever you attack with a Spirit Flame, after it's determined if your
attack would have hit (and your opponent has used, and paid for, their
defense appropriately), roll 1dX, with X being the total number of
flames. If it's in the lower (number of real flames), a real flame
hits--if not, the attack was an illusion. You do not pay the AP cost to
attack with a spirit flame, and the illusion is destroyed.<br>
<br>
In the above example, you would roll 1d9. On a roll of 1-3, an actual
Spirit Flame would have been launched. On a roll of 4 - 9, it would be
an illusion.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Mirage (Chakra 25)<br>
The Nekomata may perform the Double False Surroundings technique
(C-rank genjutsu), with an additional +5 bonus to its genjutsu roll.
The Nekomata does not need to pay the Upkeep for it, though it ends if
the Nekomata is unsummoned. This may only be used out of combat.<br>
<br>
Whenever it uses this ability, there is a 25% chance that it will,
rather than accompanying the summoner, choose to lounge nearby and
watch its illusion for the next 2d8 hours before unsummoning itself. If
the illusion is dispelled before then, the Nekomata will still unsummon
itself, but the summoner will somehow, intuitively know that someone
removed the illusion.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Illusion of Death (Chakra 16, Speed 10, 8 AP)<br>
An illusion which causes the victim to suffer from, essentially, a
dangerously overactive imagination. Whenever faced with an impending
attack, they briefly imagine fatal or otherwise crippling outcomes:
senbon piercing their trachea, a sword cutting their head clean off, a
fireball leaving them a charred corpse, and so forth. This applies a
Stun 4 whenever they take a defensive Interrupt action. This follows
all normal rules for genjutsu.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Displace (Chakra 15, Speed 4, 4 AP)<br>
Rather than actually avoiding an attack, the Nekomata confounds its
assailant with a clever illusion. This may be used as a defensive
interrupt, in place of a dodge. The Nekomata makes a genjutsu roll
against its attacker; if it succeeds, it dodges the attack. If it
succeeds by 10 or more, it may then specify a new target within the
attacker's range (including how far they can move as part of their
attack), and redirect the attack at them. Someone defending against
this technique does not receive the normal cumulative bonus to genjutsu
rolls from being affected by a technique repeatedly.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Vanish (Chakra 20, Speed 10, 6 AP)<br>
The Nekomata makes a Genjutsu roll with a +10 bonus. Anyone who fails
their defensive genjutsu roll loses sight of it; it immediately becomes
invisible, enters Stealth 3, and moves up to (the result of its
Genjutsu roll) yards in any direction.<br>
<br>
The movement occurs even if its genjutsu roll failed. To anyone who
passed their roll, or later finds it, the Nekomata is fully visible; to
anyone else, it remains invisible. The &amp;quot;Point
Out&amp;quot; action has no effect when used against a Nekomata
hidden this way. If it uses Spirit Flames or Cremation it will
immediately exit stealth; however, attacking with an already-created
Spirit Flame only reduces its Stealth TN by 4.<br>
<br>
As with an ordinary genjutsu, victims receive a cumulative bonus to
defend against this technique for each time they've been affected by it
in combat. Unlike normal genjutsu, this effect doesn't end if the
people who the Nekomata is hidden from are wounded.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Of the animals summoned by the feline contract, nekomata are the
closest to 'normal' cats in terms of behavior. They're fickle, lazy,
easily distracted, and prone to randomly becoming bored. Any time it
uses one of its abilities (other than Mirage, which has its own rules)
there's a 5% chance that it will lose interest and unsummon
itself.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Despite appearing in many myths, it's unclear what exactly rakshasa
are; descriptions of their appearances and behavior are wildly
inconsistent, from giant black tigers with vicious fangs and claws, to
cannibals with flaming eyes and hair, to cruel spirits in human form.
Of course, it's also possible that several of those depictions are
true, as rakshasa are also rumored to be capable of changing their form
as easily as a human would change clothes.<br>
<br>
When called upon by shinobi, however, they tend to follow a consistent
appearance, that of a tall man (even 'female' rakshasa apparently take
on masculine bodies) with the head of a tiger, retractable claws at the
ends of their fingers, and orange-and-black fur across their bodies.
Most are dressed in robes, typically red and gold in coloration. Some
look noble, others feral and violent.<br>

<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
A rakshasa's behavior and demeanor varies as wildly as their
appearance, and so there's no way of knowing whether the creature
summoned genuinely intends to assist the summoner to the best of their
ability, or is only helping them for the opportunity to sabotage their
goals later on. As such, summoning a Rakshasa is a calculated risk in
most circumstances.<br>
<br>
All Rakshasa can speak any human language (and some of unclear origin)
flawlessly and without accent; while some sound refined and others
harsh and guttural, these seem to be personal affectations on the parts
of the rakshasa themselves.<br>

###### Dark Mind<br>
Though a Rakshasa's mind is not too different from a human's to affect
with genjutsu, doing so can be risky. Attempting to influence its mind
risks the person doing so suffering a painful feedback through their
chakra, typically in the form of a sudden wave of horror. If a Rakshasa
is targeted by a genjutsu and rolls an 11 or above on its defensive
genjutsu roll, the person who targeted it automatically loses 1
Willpower. If they have no Willpower remaining, they instead suffer a
Stun 10.<br>
<br>
###### Spirit Siphon<br>
Unlike most summons, the Rakshasa may spend Willpower--or, more
specifically, its owner's. This can be done any time Willpower would
normally be spent, with the usual effects. If the Rakshasa betrays its
summoner (see Treachery, below) in combat, it will always use Spirit
Siphon on the attack made against them.<br>
<br>
###### Treachery<br>
Unlike most summons, Rakshasa will sometimes turn against the ninja who
called upon them--but there's no way of knowing that one is planning to
do so until it's too late. Every time the Rakshasa is given a task, or
acts in combat, there is a 10% chance that it will somehow turn against
the summoner. This could mean informing people who it was sent to spy
on that the summoner is nearby, or sabotaging the path it was sent to
scout; in combat, this check is made whenever it attacks. If the 10%
chance takes place, it instead attacks the summoner with the same
technique. After the Rakshasa betrays their summoner this way, it will
disappear (often cackling evilly as it does so); after five checks have
been made without betraying the summoner, that particular Rakshasa will
not do so for the remainder of the time it's summoned. Additionally,
Rakshasa will not betray summoners with 6000 or more XP.<br>

<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Banishment (Speed 6, Chakra 30, 4 AP)<br>
This technique can be used in response to any attack which targets the
Rakshasa, including area-of-effect techniques whose radius it's in. The
Rakshasa traces a mandala in mid-air, the symbols etching themselves in
ghostly flames, and the offending objects are removed.<br>
Used against ninjutsu, the technique disappears completely, as if it
had never been used (though any costs are still paid). Against weapon
taijutsu, the weapons vanish; unique weapons (ones not from the
Equipment section of the PHB) reappear 2d100 yards away from the
Rakshasa, in the opposite direction from the attacker. Melee attackers
instead reappear 2d20 yards in a direction of the Rakshasa's choosing.<br>
<br>
###### Burning Chains (Speed 12, Chakra 40, 8 AP)<br>
The Rakshasa levels a gaze at a target and speaks in an
incomprehensible language; the flames around that person lift
themselves off the individual's body and form chains of dark red fire
and burnt iron, anchoring the unfortunate soul to the ground. This can
only target someone suffering from Ignite, and cannot be defended
against, though the Rakshasa must be able to see the target, and it has
a range of 50.<br>
All Ignites on the target are suspended, and instead converted into
Immobilization penalties; Ignite 8 would become -8 Immobilize. The
&amp;quot;Ignite&amp;quot; continues to decay at its normal
rate, but effects which remove or reduce Ignite don't work (since it's
an Immobilize, not an Ignite). Removing the Immobilize penalty from
Burning Chains causes the Rakshasa's Upkeep to end, and the Ignite to
return.<br>
If the Rakshasa betrays its summoner when ordered to use Burning
Chains, it first transfers all Ignites from the target to the summoner,
and then uses Burning Chains.<br>
<br>
###### Immolate (Speed 16, Chakra 50, 10 AP)<br>
With a single gesture, the Rakshasa lights its victim ablaze. This
applies an automatic Ignite 10; it cannot be blocked, parried, or
stopped with ninjutsu-based defenses (such as Ocean Shield). It can be
dodged, though doing so is done at a -10 penalty. If used against
summons, this deals damage as a percent of their maximum Vitality (as
if it was damaging HP under normal Ignite rules), rather than current,
and is reduced at half the normal speed (RES/40 rather than RES/20).
Immolate has a range of 40 yards, or 80 yards if used against a
summoned creature.<br>
<br>
###### Rake (Speed 12, Stamina 15, 2 AP)<br>
The Rakshasa slashes someone with its claws. This deals 12d20 Slashing
damage, ignores armor, and inflicts a Bleed 8 status.<br>
<br>
###### Shadow Step (Speed +4, +Delay 8, +6 AP)<br>
The Rakshasa takes a step forward, then dissolves into wisps of pitch
black smoke and the smell of charcoal; moments later it reappears with
the same show of smoke, striking from its own personal darkness. This
augments one of the Rakshasa's melee attacks (Rake or Soul Rot), and
modifies its parameters accordingly. Between the time the action is
used and when the Delay ends, the Rakshasa cannot be targeted; after
the Delay, it reappears on the battle field, in range of whoever its
target is.<br>
When a Shadow Step attack is used, the Rakshasa does not need to
specify its target. When the Delay ends, it appears behind its target;
this can target anyone who within 200 yards and not in Stealth when
Shadow Step was used. Entering Stealth, creating clones, or moving away
during the Delay will not prevent the Rakshasa from finding its mark.<br>
When Shadow Step is declared, the Rakshasa can either sacrifice 10% of
its maximum Vitality for a +4 bonus to Accuracy, or 20% for a +8 bonus.<br>
<br>
###### Soul Rot (Speed 18, Chakra 40, 15 AP)<br>
The Rakshasa makes a melee strike against a victim, but rather than
dealing a vicious blow lightly rakes its claws across them--and in
doing so, bestows a potent curse upon them. The unfortunate recipient
will begin experiencing a horrid pain across their body--and, more
pressingly, start dying rapidly. Every IC that passes, they lose 20 HP.
This persists until the Rakshasa is unsummoned, the victim falls below
0 HP, or the Rakshasa's summoner orders the creature to end the effect.
If a Rakshasa uses this on the summoner after betraying them, the
effect instead persists until the summoner's HP falls below 0 or a
Contract Seal is applied to them.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Summon Avatar: Byakko<br>
1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
A mythical creature, Byakko is said to be the guardian of the west, and
the symbolic representation of autumn, righteousness, and iron. The
actual, physical Byakko is also a white tiger large enough to crush
houses under a single paw, possessing a roar that can flatten trees and
a ferocious gaze that can send all but the mightiest opponents fleeing
in terror.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 40<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Byakko is the Lord of Beasts, the apex predator of the land. In his
eyes, he is the almighty emperor of the world; all other animals, and
even shinobi, are his subjects. He is a stern, but magnanimous ruler,
free of contempt, scruelty, or scorn for his 'subjects'--his lordship
of them is only natural, in light of his all-eclipsing power.<br>
<br>
Even other summoned avatars are viewed not as equals by Byakko, but
rather as challenging prey.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
## Summoning Contract: Hare<br>
Hares (including rabbits, but really, what ninja knows the difference?)
are the least adept in battle of all the major species of summoned
animals. Much like their wild counterparts they are not predatory and
have no natural defenses beyond their ability to flee (which they are,
to be fair, quite good at).<br>
<br>
That alone ensures that most ninja do not consider the rabbits worth
the time and effort involved in fostering good relations with them.
Still, some go to the trouble of doing so.<br>
<br>
Hares are kind-hearted creatures, but not weak-willed. They will not
tolerate a master who takes delight in causing others suffering, or who
is unwilling to attempt to resolve issues peacefully. Similarly, when
confronting enemies who they view as genuinely evil, the few
combat-capable summoned rabbits display a shocking degree of
remorselessness.<br>

&lt;br&gt; 4500 XP: Summon: Tsuki no Usagi&lt;/text&gt;<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
## Techniques<br>
<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Chiisana Usagi - Summoning: A Small Rabbit )--<br>
It does exactly what it says: summons a small rabbit. These are
remarkably docile and friendly creatures, and an exception to the
standard that summoned animals won't simply wait around at their
summoner's leisure.<br>
<br>
The rabbit cannot talk, and lacks any obvious supernatural talents. It
likes carrots and lettuce, and will allow itself to be carried around
and petted at the summoner's leisure.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X/2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If anyone attempts to attack the rabbit or its summoner it flees
immediately, leaping away before disappearing in a puff of smoke.<br>
<br>
However, whenever there is someone hidden within 10+X yards who the
summoner doesn't know about, the rabbit will tense up begin shaking,
going very still as its ears perk up.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Gaikou Tokken - Diplomatic Immunity )--<br>
Attempting to negotiate as a ninja is a risky prospect, because as
often as not the people you try to talk to really don't care that you
have a white flag, and would rather jump and murder you than listen to
you explaining why violence really isn't necessary.<br>
<br>
This technique creates a wooden pendant, a circle with three carved
hares inside it forming a triskelion of sorts, which can only be worn
by the summoner (and, if not put on within a minute, crumbles to dust).
So long as it's worn, they have significant protections against
hostility, though in exchange must live up to their own set of
standards.<br>
<br>
The pendant's design looks something like so:<br>
http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/images/Tinners2.gif<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 60<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Anyone attacking, hindering, or taking other hostile actions against
you has a -15 penalty to any associated Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion
rolls, and a -5 penalty to their Accuracy and other offensive rolls
against you. Additionally, during this technique's duration you gain
100 DR.<br>
<br>
However, you cannot attack anyone who hasn't attacked you first or take
other hostile actions that aren't in self-defense. You may not hide
(via Stealth) unless it's during battle. You cannot enter any
buildings, camps, or other guarded areas without first making your
presence known to the owners, occupants, or guards (as appropriate) and
receiving their permission.<br>
<br>
If you break the restrictions of this technique, the wooden pendant
shatters and its effects end immediately. When this occurs you
automatically advance two Fatigue levels; this increase in Fatigue
cannot be avoided.<br>
<br>
You can also take the pendant off, in which case it simply crumbles to
dust. The pendant must be worn obviously; you cannot tuck it into a
shirt or otherwise deliberately hide it. If you do so, or if you
attempt to actively goad people into attacking you (to inflict its
penalties on them before you retaliate), it breaks. The pendant will
not last longer than 6 hours.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Inaba no Usagi - Hare of Inaba )--<br>
According to legends, the goddess Amaterasu was once wandering the land
looking for a place to rest for the night. As the story goes, she was
approached by a rabbit which took her to the town of Inaba, and for its
kindness she gave it her blessings.<br>
<br>
It's rather hard to believe that the story's true, the rabbit was real,
and it's still alive and available to be summoned--it's more likely
that 'Hare of Inaba' is the collective term given to these large (for
rabbits) white rabbits, though more supersticious people are hesitant
to harm them all the same, as the myth claims anyone who does so will
incur the sun goddess' wrath.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This summons a white rabbit which cannot speak. When it's called, the
summoner asks it to guide them to a location of their choosing. This
may be a place the summoner is familiar with, or a descriptive (rather
than specific) location; &amp;quot;The other side of this mountain
range&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The nearest town&amp;quot;
would both be acceptable, but &amp;quot;The enemy
camp,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The nearest group of shinobi
hiding from us&amp;quot; would not. In short, it could not be used
to find a person or group that doesn't want to be found or whose
existence the summoner isn't aware of.<br>
<br>
However, it will then flawlessly lead the summoner and anyone with
them, at a pace equivalent to a brisk walk (or slower, if necessary),
to the chosen location so long as it's within a week's travel. It will
lead them around all ambushes, traps, snares, hidden enemies, and so
on. If it reaches a point where this is impossible (there is only a
single bridge crossing a river and there are explosives planted on it,
or enemies waiting to attack on the other side) it will stop and sit
there, shaking, until either the threat is dealt with or it's carried
through the 'danger zone' by its summoner.<br>
<br>
If the rabbit is attacked, it flees instantly, though there may be more
to this story of a 'curse' befalling those who attempt to injure it
than most shinobi believe. However, attempting to use the rabbit as a
'shield' of sorts (summoning it in battle as a deterrent to someone
attacking you or the area near you) is a Breach of Contract.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
###&nbsp; --( Seiiki - Sanctuary )--<br>
Following the hare's ideals of nonviolent resolution of conflicts, this
technique facilitates peaceful negotiations by ensuring that those who
attempt to use diplomacy as a cover to ambush or attack their enemies
are punished for doing so. How the technique works at all puzzles
shinobi, as it doesn't have similarities to any known sort of jutsu.<br>
<br>
After the technique is completed, the entire affected area somehow
seems lighter and more peaceful. Anyone inside its boundaries
instinctively knows that hostility is not welcome, and has a marked
aversion to any such actions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 0<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 100 + X*2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 80<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Taking any sort of offensive action within the area is prohibited, as
is deliberately launching attacks into it. Offensive actions include
all attacks and targeted genjutsu, whether or not they deal damage.
Setting explosives and modifying the terrain for combat (for example,
the A-rank Yomi Numa, or Katon explosive clouds) are offensive actions.<br>
<br>
Breaking this rule carries a harsh penalty: Anyone who does so has a
-10 penalty to all their offensive actions, including Accuracy,
genjutsu, Stealth and Awareness rolls, Toxicology and Chakra Control
rolls to inflict status effects, and parry rolls made as part of
'counter-attack' moves (such as Halting Blow). This lasts for as long
as they're in the sanctuary field, and one hour afterwards.<br>
<br>
Once a person has violated the sanctuary's restrictions, they can be
attacked and otherwise subjected to offensive actions with impunity;
anyone attacking them is not breaking the rules of the sanctuary.
Anybody who aids them, however, such as taking a hit for them or giving
them supplies mid-battle, is similarly affected if they do so within
the field.<br>
<br>
This lasts X/4 hours, to a maximum of 12. The summoner may not choose
to end it early, and is subject to the same restrictions and penalties
as anyone else.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
Said to be the rabbit who lives under the moon, it only comes out at
night. One of the caste of direct minions of the avatar, he is the
moonlight to the avatar's moon in actuality. You should not summon the
Jade Rabbit during the day, it is too busy sleeping and if you do it
has dire consequences (Read below). It actually floats around and can
help you find anything touched by the moonlight. It will not attack
unless it is attacked first.<br>
<br>

&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Shining Light<br>
While under the moonlight the rabbit emits a bright light, this shines
out for 20 yards and anyone in stealth is revealed, but while this
light shines you cannot stealth either.<br>
<br>
###### Elusive Target<br>
The rabbit is small and has the luck of the moon! It has access to the
Ninjutsu, Kawarimi. It also takes no damage from AoE attacks where it
isn't the sole target.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Actions<br>
The Jade Rabbit may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the
Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. <br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blinding Flash (Speed 10, AP 12)<br>
The Jade Rabbit is a beacon of hope but also one of light! This
technique uses the C-rank Raiton Taiyoken<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bite (Speed 8, 4 AP)<br>
Not an amazing combatant, the Jade Rabbit usually gets out of dangerous
situations using it's teeth. A bite inflicts 4d6 piercing damage and is
considered a basic unarmed attack. The Jade Rabbit bite is far more
painful than it is actually damaging and if used in a grapple, it gets
a +10 to the check to escape the grapple.<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burning Brilliance (Special) <br>
If you do, in fact, summon the rabbit during the day, it appears in a
spot 1d12 Yards away from you in a random direction (Chosen by rolling
a D8 and north, north-east, etc). Once it appears there it bursts into
flames and suddenly combusts, unsummoning itself in a burst of fiery
flames, the blast counting as a C-rank Katon that does 8d20 damage in
an 8 yard AoE centered on the Rabbit. The Rabbits damage bonus is
trippled and if it hits the user, it deals double damage.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Jade Rabbits are a straightforward bunch and will stick around with
you as long as you need their light and as long as it's not day time!
If you do summon one during the day it will stay for the duration of
one combat and then not be summonable for 30 Days OOC.<br>

====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Literally meaning 'bodyguard', the yojimbo is just that. It's a three
foot tall bipedal white rabbit wearing a blue haori, black hakama, and
straw sandals, with its ears tied together by white cloth an an
imitation of a topknot. Yojimbo hares each carry a single katana. They
have hands, rather than forepaws, complete with opposable thumbs.<br>

You summon X Yojimbo, up to a maximum of 3.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
Trained as unified bodyguards, the caste of Yojimbo are the warriors
who protect the lesser rabbits. They are trained in martial skills and
despite their size can pack quite a punch. They each wear swords and
will fight for you though will not attack the innocent.<br>

<br>
###### Compatriots<br>
For every Yojimbo after the first present on the battlefield, all the
others receive +3 Accuracy, an additional +2 to parries, +2 to Take the
Hit, +1 to their damage bonus, and -1 to their AP costs. This stacks up
to five times (when there are six Yojimbo present).<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Actions<br>
Yojimbo may use Dodge, Move, Parry, and Block as described in the
Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. <br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iajutsu Strike (Speed 10, AP 15)<br>
The Yojimbo can make a quick strike as their first unsheathing, it
gains an additional +3 Accuracy<br>
<br>
###### Defensive Formation (Speed Variable)<br>
Protecting a target is their bread and butter, well-trained Yojimbo
keep their targets alive, it is their honor and their life. While there
are two or more Yojimbo present, they can use the ability Defensive
Formation, Total Defense, and Guard, as detailed in the Physical
Abilities<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breach of Contract:<br>
&amp;gt; Killing an enemy who surrendered or has been rendered
incapable of causing harm (i.e. unconscious or otherwise incapacitated).<br>
&amp;gt; Threatening or killing hostages or innocent bystanders.<br>
&amp;gt; Initiating combat.<br>
&amp;gt; Pursuing retreating enemies (unless they have, for
example, stolen something or kidnapped a person, and you need to
retrieve it).<br>
<br>
An exception: If an enemy surrenders, and then turns on whoever they
surrendered to, the Yojimbo will not object to their death. Indeed, the
hares will fight fight to kill that enemy, and any of that enemy's
compatriots in that encounter, unless explicitly told not
to.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

###### Bad-Tempered Rodent<br>
The mind of this rabbit is very singular. It is immune to Stun,
Genjutsu, Immobilize, and takes half damage from Bleed, Ignite, or any
other damage over time type ability. <br>
<br>
###### Elusive Target<br>
The rabbit is small and has the luck of the moon! It has access to the
Ninjutsu, Kawarimi. It also takes no damage from AoE attacks where it
isn't the sole target.<br>
<br>

###### Sharp Teeth (Speed 8, AP 10)<br>
And he can leap about! When you use this attack, you can move up to 40
yards. This does 5d20 damage, and after you calculate it fully out, you
double the total. In addition, it counts 50% higher for the purposes of
wounding. It inflicts Slashing wounds and if it every inflicts a
critical head, roll 1d20. On a 20, the opponent's head comes clean off
and they die. <br>

5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Summoning this creature is actually considered a Breach of Contract for
the hare contract itself; the Murder Rabbit can still be summoned
during the regular Breach of Contract period, which does not count as a
'new' offense (the rest of the contract will be usable again after the
three OOC week period from the initial summoning of the Murder Rabbit).
Once the Rabbit has been summoned it cannot be dismissed until it has
taken at least one human life.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Moon Rabbit is a large rabbit, though not in the same way that most
summoned avatars are: it's barely two feet long from nose to tail. The
rabbit has downy white fur, and keenly intelligent jade-green eyes.
When summoned, it typically appears sitting upright on its haunches,
with a mortar and pestle in front of it (how it handles the pestle with
its paws is quite the mystery, though it seems to have no trouble doing
so). When the rabbit speaks, it does so with a soft, serious,
androgynous voice.<br>

<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The hare avatar is not exactly a pacifist, but it does refuse to engage
in combat (if it would even be able to defend itself is a largely
academic question). Some summoners claim that they've been able to get
it to negotiate with the avatars of other contracts, both leaving the
field of battle, but even if the Moon Rabbit is willing to do that, it
probably doesn't appreciate being used as, essentially, a glorified
bargaining token.<br>
<br>
The rabbit is not exactly friendly, though 'amicable' might be a fair
description. It's a fairly serious creature, and while it will make an
effort to be helpful to its summoners, it won't appreciate being
treated like their personal dispensary or advisor on a regular basis.
Despite its diminutive stature, it's still a summoned avatar.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
According to legends, the Moon Rabbit lives on, well, the moon, where
it prepares a magical elixir which grants the gods their immortality.
This is probably not that rabbit, though there are certainly
similarities.<br>
<br>
The Moon Rabbit has extensive medical knowledge, and can identify
almost any malady which might be affecting someone, and suggest
treatments for almost any condition. If called upon to provide
consultation for medical matters, it will freely do so, and its advice
will almost always prove excellent. Though it won't stay for more than
a few hours, that's enough time to coordinate the actions of an entire
hospital for maximum efficiency, and set up highly effective triage
procedures.<br>
<br>
More commonly, however, shinobi will call upon it for its other famous
skill: the rabbit is probably the greatest apothecary alive. It can
produce restorative elixirs, medical poultices, antidotes for any known
poison (and probably some that aren't known), and, supposedly, that
mythical &amp;quot;elixir of immortality.&amp;quot; The lack of
immortal shinobi suggests that it does not, in fact, confer
immortality, however.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
## Summoning Contact: Monkey<br>
Primates are often seen as some of most intelligent of animals, in part
because of their human-like appearances and mannerisms, a fact even
more apparent in their shinobi counterparts. At the same time, monkeys
are also known to be belligerent and irreverent, and prone to causing
mischief when it suits them... which is just as true about their more
intelligent, chakra-wielding counterparts.<br>
<br>
Shinobi who form a contract with the monkeys need only a great deal of
patience, but a healthy appreciation for satire and an ability to laugh
at their own misfortunes (of which there will likely be quite a few)
are necessary to avoid going mad with frustration.<br>
<br>
What sets monkeys apart from most of the counterparts is that they're
capable of performing actual ninjutsu, complete with handseals. Not all
of them can, and they don't have as wide a variety of techniques as
actual shinobi, but it's still quite an impressive accomplishment
compared to other animals (having human-like hands helps, no doubt).<br>
<br>
The Avatar of the monkeys is the legendary Monkey King Enma, known to
command a great deal of respect even from the avatars of other
summonable species--other than the Queen of Spiders, Tsuchigumo, with
whom he has a long-standing enmity. Among his more famous traits is his
ability to transform into the Adamantime Staff, a legendary weapon said
to be without equal.<br>

## Techniques<br>
### --( Saru Tsukai - Monkey Messenger )--<br>
A small capuchin monkey dressed in a suit appears before the summoner.
He bows politely, and usually follows that up with something
bothersome, such as throwing a rock at a bystander, poking someone in
the leg with a stick, baring his hindquarters at his summoner, or some
other form of mostly-harmless message.<br>
<br>
Having done so, the monkey then waits to be a given a message. The
monkey can carry any small written document, or even recite a verbal
message--though it's best to be wary of the latter. While the monkey
will faithfully and accurately deliver all the information, he'll also
add plenty of extra insults (directed at both the recipient and the
summoner).<br>
<br>
As a messenger, Tsukai is reliable in the sense that eventually he'll
deliver whatever he was supposed to, and he's incredibly hard to catch.
On the other hand, he can be far slower than most animal--for that
matter, most human--messengers, given his propensity for taking
'breaks' and slacking off for upwards of a week at a time.<br>
<br>
Once the message is delivered, Tsukai will 'inform' the summoner of
this in the form of a prank--usually getting something shoved down the
back of their pants or having a banana thrown at the back of their
head, before the monkey vanishes. Now, if only he'd put that talent to
use in delivering his messages.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The monkey can carry a trio of normal-sized scrolls, or any
similar-sized objects--or even a small knapsack or other container
(meaning it's not limited to just messages), and will bring it to a
destination or person of your choice. If a person, you must tell the
monkey where to look for them.<br>
<br>
In combat the monkey hides after receiving the message, with a
prodigious stealth bonus of +40. After hiding the monkey will proceed
to run away at a speed of 3 yards every IC. If attacked it defends with
a +20 to dodge, and has 100 Vitality.<br>
<br>
Message delivery time is inconsistent at best, thanks to Tsukai's
nature. No matter the distance he's sent (within the shinobi nations),
the message takes 3d10 days to be delivered. This has nothing to do
with difficulty getting there, and everything to do with Tsukai getting
distracted and slacking off whenever he pleases, regardless of how
important his task may be.<br>
<br>
More than a few summoners are annoyed by Tsukai's unreliability, but,
well... what can you do?<br>
\page<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Sarusanbaigu - The Threefold Tools of the Monkey )--<br>
A long time ago, there actually were three tools, each with three
abilities. Its was a catchy name, and accurate! Over time the monkeys
picked up more tools, but haven't seen any reason to change the
technique's name. A summoner trying to explain to them that it should
be changed will be treated as if stupid by whichever monkey he happens
to be speaking to.<br>
<br>
Really, it's best to just not bring the subject up.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This summons a single item from the list below. Unlike most summoning
techniques, there is no direct limitation on how often you may perform
this one. However, each of the tools has its own duration (how long it
will stay around before vanishing in a puff of smoke, even if you were
busy using it), and its own amount of time you must wait before
summoning that particular tool again.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This does mean that you could, if you needed, summon all five of the
tools one after another in a single situation. Each of the tools can be
targeted even if you're carrying it (treated as a called) shot. They
have 100 Vitality and 100 DR, and vanish when their Vitality reaches 0.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
### = Kinaikagi - Golden Skeleton Key =<br>
An ornate (really, gaudy) golden key with a handle sculpted to resemble
the face of a monkey, complete with two small ruby eyes, and two prongs
shaped like miniature grasping monkey arms, with the keys of teeth
being the monkey's fingers. Curiously, it is able to fit keyholes of
any size, though getting it to actually open the locks takes a bit of
work.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The key functions as a +5 set of lockpicks that is always completely
silent and never breaks. Additionally, it can be thrown at a lock
within STR/4 yards. Using it this way requires an Espionage roll to
&amp;quot;pick&amp;quot; the lock without the normal +5 bonus,
as well as an Accuracy roll needing a (20 + 1 per yard the lock is
away) to actually hit the lock. If successful, whatever was being
targeted is immediately unlocked--though the key must be retrieved (or
unsummoned).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The golden key can be summoned for up to an hour, once every month (4
OOC days).<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
### = Saruhisa - The Monkey's Gourd = <br>
A small but highly polished and lacquered calabash gourd with a cap at
the top and a bright scarlet rope to secure it to one's belt, the
monkey's gourd doens't look like it should be able to hold more than
half a gallon of liquid. Sometimes, it holds less; other times, it
holds... much, much more. When summoned, the user can choose one of
three liquids for the gourd to be filled with: water, sake, or an
elixir. Regardles, the gourd can be summoned once a week (OOC day).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Water: The small gourd actually contains 20
gallons of water that can be used in jutsu, or for any normal purpose.
The gourd lasts for 1 hour and can be refilled, but anything other than
water put into it will curiously spill out despite the holder's best
efforts.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sake: Possibly a good reason to sign the monkey
contract on its own, the gourd can pour out what amounts to one shot of
sake every minute for 12 hours straight. After taking a drink (Speed 5)
the user has to make a Resistance roll against 10 + 1 per drink after
the first. Failure leaves them at a -1 penalty to Accuracy and skill
rolls, stacking with itself. It's not all bad, though, as they gain a
DR equal to the number of drinks they've had. This lasts for one hour
per drink, and after it wears off leaves the most incredible,
devastating, world-ending hangover any human is likely to experience.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Elixir: Supposedly a magical elixir, maybe just a
special mixture of drugs. The elixir is meant for consumption by
monkeys (who often face retribution for their mischevious pranks), but
works for humans as well. Taking a drink (a Speed 10 action) allows a
Resistance roll with a +2 against any status you're currently afflicted
by which originally allowed one, against the original difficulty.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
This only works against things requiring a status roll, and negates
only the penalties caused from failing. Succeeding against a poison
would end its effect entirely, while succeeding against Dragon Fire
Technique would lower the Burns and Ignite by half their original
severity; any damage already taken (or similar) is not undone.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The elixir lasts for 50 IC. Passing it on to someone else is a Speed 5
action.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
###&nbsp;&nbsp; = Gentou - Magic Lantern = <br>
An ornate golden lantern; the top and bottom are in the shape of
hexagonal cones, and the body has six gold-framed glass faces, with
golden designs of monkeys engaged in various activities inlaid in the
glass; when turned on in pitch blackness, this produces crisp
shadow-outlines of the monkeys on nearby walls.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Inside the lantern is a golden flame that can be coaxed bright or
darker with a whisper. The bottom of the lantern can be unlatched and
opened, revealing some incomprehensible mechanical devices which, with
a bit of experimentation, will raise internal shutters up to cover any
combination of the glass panes (though, really, those shutters
shouldn't be able to fit in there...). If you close all the shutters
and ask the lantern to help you, it will open the shutter that is
currently pointing north--letting it function as a compass. The light
it sheds can change to any color you request.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
By manipulating the shutters this can act like a lamp, a flashlight, or
anything inbetween. It can illuminate a radius up to 40 yards (as a
lamp), or a narrow cone up to 100 yards long (as a flashlight). It can
shine in a smaller area by dimming the flame.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Finally, if left in a spot and asked to look like a person it can
create a vague illusion of a general type of person, large man, small
child, thin woman; essentially a body shape and age/gender. The
illusion can be seen through with an Awareness check of 10, +1 per yard
away from it. This only works in poor lighting (such as at night), and
uses up the lantern's duration 10 times as fast. The illusion can be
performing any basic physical task, but nothing elaborate and nothing
requiring it to move more than ten feet from the spot the lantern was
set down at.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Gentou lasts for up to 10 hours before vanishing in a puff of smoke (or
up to 1 hour if used as an illusion for the whole duration).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;###&nbsp; = Kinnawa - Golden Rope =<br>
Created from golden monkey hairs braided into a thick rope, the Kinnawa
is long enough to be used as an improvised belt when it appears. At the
summoner's command it can extend or shorten again, and despite it's
gaudy tassels on the ends it is very tough.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
By far the best trick is that it can be thrown up into the air will it
will anchor itself to something handy (like the edge of a roof) or
absolutely nothing at all, at which point the summoner can climb up it;
alternately, it could be thrown across an opening, and the other end
anchored as well (on the ground, ideally) to let it be used like a
tightrope. The summoner can cause the rope to un-anchor itself simply
by willing it to do so while giving it a sharp tug.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The rope has a DR of 100, but can only take 10 damage before snapping.
The segment closest to the summoner remains, while the rest vanishes in
a puff of smoke. The rope can be thrown up to 50 + (the results of an
Athletics roll) feet. Golden rope is also great for tying people up,
giving a +20 bonus to the Espionage roll (instead of just +10).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Golden rope will last for an hour, or eight hours if immediately used
to tie somebody up. It can be summoned against one month (4 OOC days)
later.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;###&nbsp; = Maitatsu Tsue - Dancing Staff =<br>
A long, gnarled walking stick, sturdy and sizable enough to be used as
a bo staff by the summoner. It has the normal properties of a bo staff
(from the Equipment chapter), plus a few unique characteristics.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
If disarmed or discarded, the staff hops back up to a vertical position
of its own volitiong and begins to pogo back to the summoner. The staff
starts moving 1 IC after it's been disarmed, and moves 1 yard per IC;
when moving like this, it can be 'picked up' as a Speed 0 action.
Immobilization penalties slow it down normally.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
If grabbed by anyone else the staff will wait 5 IC before striking them
in the face and bouncing free, applying a Stun 4 effect and resuming
its trip back to its summoner.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Outside of combat, if propped up and told to 'stay' it will do just
that. The staff will stand straight up, or at any improbable angle, as
if held by an invisible force. It's virtually immovable like this, and
can be used in all sorts of creative ways--such as hopping on top of it
and posing dramatically.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The staff can be summoned for up to four hours, once every two weeks (2
OOC days).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Migawarizaru - Substitution Monkey )--<br>
Migawarizaru is summoned in response to an attack, the monkey taking
the hit for the shinobi. Or, rather, one of his many clones does; a
puff of smoke engulfs the 'ninja' who was just hit, revealing them to
be a monkey, before that monkey vanishes in another puff of smoke.
Moments later duplicates of the summoner begin appearing across the
battlefield, each of them cloned monkeys disguised as the summoner via
Henge no Jutsu. One of them is the summoned monkey himself,
indistinguishable from the rest. In the ensuing confusion the summoner
is free to either escape the battle, or take advantage of the situation
to strike.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 32<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: +6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Migawizaru functions similarly to Kawarimi. You may use it after
failing to dodge a technique, so long as partial defense applies. So
long as the dodge's new total Speed (including the +6 from Migawizaru,
and its Seal Speed) would allow it to be used as a valid Interrupt, you
may pay 10 AP to fully dodge the attack and use this technique. As a
reminder, while you could use AP to reduce the final Speed of Dodge +
Migawiaru to 4 (2+6 = 8, to a minimum of half that with AP), the
modified Seal Speed, if above 0, cannot be reduced this way.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
After the substitution is used, the monkey himself appears along with
seven more clones on the battlefield, each of them disguised as the
summoner and carrying on with some form of obnoxious antics. The
summoner may choose to either immediately attempt to enter stealth
(with their opponent(s) receiving an immediate Awareness roll against
their Stealth roll), or automatically hide among clones as with a
normal Bunshin technique.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
When the clones are targeted, roll 1dX; X is equal to the number of
clones remaining, plus 1 for Migawizaru, plus 1 more if the summoner is
hidden among them. On a roll of 1, the Migawizaru is hit and they all
vanish. If the summoner is hidden among the clones, 1 hits the summoner
(and all the clones vanish, along with Migawizaru) and 2 hits
Migawizaru.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Daisan Enchouzou - Three Great Monkey Statues )--<br>
Technically a trio of separate summoning techniques, each one calling a
separate giant stone monkey statue. The story behind these statues
varies depending upon who you ask, but in the case of the actual
summoning contract they serve as a conduit for the summoning of the
Handsome Monkey Prince (or maybe he's just too vain to show up until
the summoner's gone through the effort of calling the statues; really,
it could be either one).<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Each of these techniques has a &amp;quot;(30 - X)&amp;quot; in
its Chakra cost. X is the number of IC which have passed since the last
time you summoned one of the three statues, with a minimum of 0. Thus,
if you summoned one at the beginning of the battle, it would be Chakra
30; if you summoned another 50 IC later, it would also be Chakra 30;
and if you summoned the last statue 10 IC after that, it would have a
Chakra cost of 50.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
--( Iwazaru - Speak No Evil )--<br>
The first monkey appears as 10 yard tall statue that looks to be made
out of a gleaming metal of some sort. The statue is that of a sitting
monkey covering its mouth with its hands. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30 + (30 - X)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The statue has 1000 Hit Points, and a Damage Reduction of 200 which
applies against all thrown weapons other than Fuuma Shurike and Large
Star Shuriken.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Anyone within the area who speaks, or spends AP to control the actions
of a summoned creature, loses half their current AP (after any such
expenditure) and gains no AP the next time the initiative count reaches
a multiple of 20. Taking any action with a Speed above 10 also incurs
this effect, unless the shinobi is careful to be quiet, which amounts
to taking a -2 immobilization penalty for their action. After suffering
the statue's effects once, a shinobi will be able to figure out what
will cause them from then on.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Kikazaru - Hear No Evil )--<br>
Another 10 yard tall statue, this monkey seems to be crafted of a solid
white marble. It appears sitting atop the previous statue, hands
covering its ears. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30 + (30-X)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
When Kikazaru is summoned, everyone present on the battlefield receives
a &amp;quot;Curse Counter&amp;quot;, with its value starting at
0. Whenever someone takes an action, their counter is raised by that
action's Speed. Every time the IC reaches a multiple of 10, the statue
'checks' to see who has the highest Curse Counter. That individual (or
those individuals, if there's a tie) suffers a -4 immobilization
penalty, and has their Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties doubled.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
The immobilization penalty lasts until a new individual is cursed (and
the Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties double each time, if the
same person is the victim repeatedly), or the statue is destroyed or
unsummoned.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Mizaru - See No Evil )--<br>
The final statue appears atop any previous statues, creating quite the
impressive display being 30 yards tall when all three are in play. Also
10 yards tall, the statue appears to be made of a white wood, the
monkey's hands covering its eyes. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30 + (30-X)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Whenever anyone in Mizaru's area inflicts a wound on someone else, they
suffer a -8 visibility penalty for 10 IC, +10 per level of severity of
the wound (20 for a minor, 30 for a major, etc.). This ends prematurely
if the statue is destroyed or unsummoned.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Multiple afflictions from this statue don't stack. Longer durations
overwrite shorter ones.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

Appearing as a small brown capuchin, the Partner Monkey is a simple
creature summoned to provide assistance with small tasks. Being of such
small stature and with little to no combat skills, the Partner Monkey
is quite skilled at sneaking into tight spots and stealing small
objects. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
One of the few monkeys that can't speak, the Partner Monkey can easily
understand most orders, and if treated well it will be happy to follow
any that don't put it into danger.&nbsp; Not helping out of the
goodness of it's own heart... the Partner Monkey likes to be given
treats. Fruits and candies are usually enough to get it to perform most
any task that it doesn't think is immediately dangerous.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Almost Tireless<br>
Partner Monkeys do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls
for their actions. Instead, they reduce their current Vitality by
(Stamina or Chakra cost)*3.&nbsp; They do not normally accumulate
penalties to Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion; if they have penalties from
an outside source (such as Suffocation or some poisons), add those to
the effective Stamina or Chakra cost to determine how much Vitality
they lose.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Dextrous Fingers<br>
A Partner Monkey has small hands with powerful fingers, allowing it to
pick locks without the use of any lockpicks.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Extraordinary Reflexes<br>
Given the monkey's agility, it can dodge attacks as a Speed 0
interrupt. <br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Small<br>
The Partner Monkey is very small and light, being able to move while
still maintaining Stealth 2. In addition, all knockback effects have
their efficacy doubled. <br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Actions<br>
Partner Monkey may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the
Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. <br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Bite (Speed 8, 4 AP)<br>
Not an amazing combatant, the Partner Monkey usually gets out of
dangerous situations using it's teeth. A bite inflicts 4d6 piercing
damage and is considered a basic unarmed attack. The Partner Monkey's
bite is far more painful than it is actually damaging and if used in a
grapple, it gets a +10 to the check to escape the grapple.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Scout (Speed Variable, 10 AP)<br>
One of the few uses of the Partner Monkey in a combat situation, the
Summoner can send the Partner Monkey out to scout an area. This works
by giving the monkey a general location to scout out and choosing how
long they wish the monkey to be gone. The Partner Monkey can move 3
yards per IC towards the location. Once there the monkey does a quick
search(using up 0 IC), but can also use 6 more IC to do a search
actions. When declaring a scouting action you may choose to set a time
for the monkey to return in which case it will only have scouted the
area it was able to reach before have to come back... or you may have
the Partner Monkey simply go to an area and search a few times(your
choice) before coming back. Note that the speed of the action is based
upon how far the Partner Monkey has to travel(and travel back from) as
well as time spent searching. Upon it's return, the Monkey will perform
a sort of pantomime that for some reason the Summoner is able to
understand and gain general details about the scouted area. These
details include: general terrain, prescence of enemies(that it saw
using awareness), and any obstacles.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Monkey Mission (Speed Variable, 5 AP per
action/skill use)<br>
Similar to the Scout action, the summoner sends the Monkey on a
non-dangerous mission utilizing it's skills. This could be as simple as
hopping over a fence and undoing a latch from the other side to as
complicated as scaling a building, unlocking a window, opening a safe,
and finally stealing a set of plans before coming back. Like scouting,
the Partner Monkey can move 3 yards per IC and requires 10 IC for each
use of a skill other than awareness. The Monkey can be sent on a wide
range of missions, but be warned that if it senses any danger it can't
be sure to avoid it will abandon the mission and return rather than
braving the odds.<br>
<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Perform Ninjutsu (Speed Variable, Variable
AP)<br>
The Partner Monkey can actually perform a small selection of Ninjutsu,
or be commanded to perform them at a set time. The Partner Monkey has a
Seal Speed reduction of 6, and does not use Stamina or Chakra rolls
when using the Jutsu it knows. Instead, subtract (Chakra Cost)*3 from
the Partner Monkey's Vitality whenever it uses a Jutsu. The Summoner
has to spend AP equal to 1/2 the speed of the jutsu(including the
remaining seal speed). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; =Jutsu Known= <br>
Ninjutsu: Henge no Jutsu : Limited to a small wind up monkey toy with
cymbals.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Ninjutsu: Genjutsu Kai : Can use on the summoner, but only if commanded
to.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Fuuton: Soujikaze no Jutsu : Clearing out smoke and mist.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Fuuton: Kazekiri : Cutting ropes or making openings in thin barriers.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Fuuton: Rakuyou Buyou : Escaping once it sees danger.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
Fuuton: Nagare : To leap down from extreme heights.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The partner monkey has been known to refuse a mission if it does not
receive a treat or trinket as payment when summoned or given particular
taxing tasks (most ninja capable of summoning it will keep a bag of
peanuts or a few shiny beads around, for just this purpose).<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
If the summoner knowingly sends the monkey into danger (deliberate
combat, or as a decoy), the partner monkey will immediately leave, and
this will be considered a Breach of Contract. Even afterwards, the
monkey will be grumpy when summoned, and require heavy condolences
(bananas work wonders) before listening to the summoner at all.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Being summoned to help the summoner when they're in genuine, dire need
(meaning the summoner is already fighting, and doesn't, for example,
immediately hide or flee once the monkey shows up) is acceptable, but
the monkey does not like it and will only perform up to four actions
(be they attacks or jutsu) before it protests and leaves in a puff of
smoke. Again, it will require an 'apology' in the form of gifts before
helping again.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Monkey Prince<br>
&gt;1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
3. Attributes<br>
4. Abilities<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Handsome Monkey Prince (or, &amp;quot;Tansei
Sarukou&amp;quot;) has an almost human stature, bipedal and close
to six feet tall, resembling a man with the fur and tail of a monkey.
He's also possessed of incredibly good looks, disarming charm, and
phenomenal wit... or, so he tells it. He appears dressed in a bright
red breasplate, bracers, and greaves, along with fine black pants and a
gaudy golden belt.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 120 <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
The best way to summon the Prince is to first provide a fitting
demonstration of one's admiration for him by summoning the Three Great
Monkey Statues. If one is present on the battlefield, his Chakra cost
is reduced to 100; if two are present, it's reduced to 80. If all three
statues are present in battle, it only costs 40 Chakra to summon the
prince.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
When he's summoned, the statues vanish. The statues themselves cannot
be summoned while he's present on a battlefield.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Most believe the Monkey Prince added the 'handsome' to his own name, a
testament to his own pride and vanity.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
When summoned, he will 'politely' ask the summoner to stand back and
watch him&nbsp; handle the problem at hand. The more of the statues
that were summoned before he was, the more politel he'll be. With all
three having been used to summon him he'll show up ready and
enthusiastic to jump into a fight, so long as the summoner doesn't try
to boss him around. Without any having been used the Monkey Prince will
be positively snobbish, and will only fight on the summoner's behalf if
said summoner shows him great respect.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
In combat, the Monkey Prince actively mocks and humiliates his
opponents, dancing around and delivering alternating attacks and
taunts. He expects his summoner to stand back and simply watch as the
Prince does his thing, unless the Prince is being attacked by a
summoner and a summoned creature simultaneously--in which case he
expects the summoner to assist him.<br>
&lt;Br&gt;<br>

<br>
<br>
###### Extraordinary Reflexes<br>
Given the Monkey Prince's agility, he can dodge attacks as a Speed 0
interrupt. <br>
<br>
###### Golden Flip<br>
The Monkey Prince suffers no penalty to dodge area of effect
techniques, and upon succesfully dodging one can move to any edge of
the area automatically.<br>
<br>
###### Tireless<br>
The Monkey Prince does not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion
rolls when he acst(other than performing jutsu). If forced to by an
outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +10 to their rolls.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
###### Independent<br>
The Monkey Prince is too vain to be given orders by the Summoner.
Instead the Monkey Prince will simply attack anyone immediately hostile
to his loyal subject(the summoner). In addition, the Monkey Prince acts
of his own volition, not requiring AP from the summoner.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Mountain-Conquering Pride<br>
If pitted against another summoned creature, the Handsome Monkey Prince
receives a bonus to his Accuracy, dodge, and skill rolls equal to (the
minimum listed XP needed to summon that creature)/500, and an increase
to his damage bnous equal to (that amount of XP)/1000, to one decimal
place as usual. If its XP level is 4000 or higher, he does not pay any
cost when using his ninjutsu against them.<br>
<br>
If fighting a person, these bonuses instead come from that individual's
actual XP (sub-total XP, in the case of clanless). If fighting both
people and summons (or multiple of either), he only uses the highest
bonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Peerless Champion<br>
The monkey prince uses only a fraction of his real strength in order to
give his opponents a sporting chance, and if someone exceeds his
expectations will raise them accordingly. Every time one of his attacks
misses, he gains +2 Accuracy for the rest of the battle. Every time he
fails to dodge an attack, he gains +1 dodge for the rest of the battle.
Finally, every time the damage from one of his attacks is completely
prevented (such as by DR, or the Earth Shore Return technique) his
physical and ninjutsu damage bonuses are both increased by 2 for the
remainder of the battle.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Actions<br>
The Monkey Prince may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the
Combat chapter of the PHB.<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Strike (Speed 8)<br>
Skilled with using his hands, feet, tail, and most other parts of his
body as a weapon the Monkey Prince can strike pretty hard when he wants
to. While he could hit much harder than he does--he's strong enough to
lift mountains overhead, he'll assure his summoners--he prefers to goad
his opponents with weaker, glancing blows. A strike from the Prince
does 10d10 Blunt damage, as a basic unarmed attack.<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Golden Cloud (Speed 4)<br>
The Monkey Prince is well known for his flying Golden Cloud, and for
the listed speed he can summon it to his side and hop on. It is, as its
name suggests, a small opaque golden cloud, about four feet across. The
Prince can sit or stand on it; anyone else simply falls through. On the
cloud the Monkey Prince has a +3 bonus to dodge and can move 5 yards
every IC. If he makes an attack or uses a jutsu he dismounts from the
cloud, and has to call it again to receive its benefits. Despite its
ability to fly, the cloud can only reach an altitude of 30 yards. The
Prince claims this is an arbitrary limit he has imposed upon it in
combat, to make fights more fair for his opponents.<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Decoy (Speed 5, Interrupt)<br>
When attempting to dodge against a melee-range attack and gaining only
a partial success, the Monkey Prince can spend 50 Vitality to avoid the
attack entirely and leave a clone behind. The prince immediately makes
a Stealth roll with a +15 bonus, opposed by his opponent's Awareness.
On success, the Prince is hidden and the opponent thinks the clone is
the prince.<br>
<br>
The clone will call the opponent names, taunt them, and dodge attacks
until it's hit--at which point it's destroyed, as with a normal clone,
and the enemy will realize what happened. However, the Prince will
still be hidden!<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Perform Ninjutsu (Speed Variable)<br>
The Monkey Prince knows ninjutsu! It's mostly something he learned
because it was interesting, but he got bored and stopped learning jutsu
after picking a few Katon and Fuuton techniques. He could learn all the
ninjutsu if he pleased, but it would be much too troublesome.<br>
<br>
He reduces Seal Speeds by 12, and does not make Stamina or Chakra rolls
when using jutsu. Instead, his current Vitality is reduced by (Chakra
cost)*3 whenever he performs a jutsu. The Prince knows the following
techniques:<br>
=Jutsu Known= <br>
Fuuton: Wind Release Stream<br>
Fuuton: Great Breakthrough (generally used to knock people away before
they get close, for harassment purposes)<br>
Fuuton: Violent Wind Palm (he doesn't carry any throwing weapons)<br>
Fuuton: Wind Turtle's Shell<br>
Fuuton: Vaulting Leap <br>
Katon: Flame Flower<br>
Katon: Sticky Fire Technique<br>
Katon: Grand Fireball<br>
Katon: Great Dragon Fire<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Handsome Monkey Prince is extremely vain and self-important. If the
summoner doesn't show him proper respect and deferential treatment
(flattery always helps), the Prince will get annoyed and leave. There
are many nobles who aboslutely abhor sycophants, but the Handsome
Monkey Prince is not one of them. The more the summoner praises and
fawns over him, the more the Prince will like the summoner and enjoy
being called out to assist them.<br>
<br>
In combat, once the Monkey Prince is summoned he will expect the
summoner to stand aside and let the Prince fight. If the summoner tries
to help the Monkey Prince will tell him to stop, and step aside; if the
summoner continues, the Prince will get angry and leave.<br>
<br>
That being said, if his enemy goes out of their way to attack the
summoner, the Prince won't object to them defending themselves or
retaliating. Similarly, if he's fighting a summoner and their own
summoned creature, he won't mind his own summoner helping him. However,
in other situations he'll want to fight alone (or possibly with the
help of other summoned monkeys), even if outnumbered.<br>

5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Guardians against evil, Munamochisaru (&amp;quot;Pillar-Supporting
Monkeys&amp;quot;) are strong enough to act as pillars and hold the
roofs of massive shrines up. They're enormous, more than forty feet
tall and rippling with muscles; despite being often mistaken for apes,
they are, in fact, giant monkeys. These enormous, brown-furred
creatures are far more serious than most of their kin, some of the most
dutiful and honor-bound of their species, and prove quick to defend
their summoners.<br>
<br>
That said, they're not much use for anything that doesn't involve brute
force. Being a forty foot tall monkey sort of... has that effect.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Supposedly, the Munamochi-saru can speak and perform handseals like
other monkeys can--however, none of them ever seem to do so. They
understand orders, and seem to be quiet intelligent, but say nothing in
response, usually just gruffly nodding their heads, occasionally
grunting in affirmation, and solving problems with their muscles.<br>
<br>
They're quick to use their size and strength to defend the summoner and
any of the summoner's friends or allies. They'll also actively defend
the pure and innocent, even without orders (this almost always includes
children; adults are another matter entirely). They usually have no
qualms about attacking the summoner's enemies, but will try to
minimalize collateral damage, as they're very capable of tearing up
massive areas of the landscape when they fight.<br>

###### Extended Range<br>
Munamochi-Saru have a 10 yard attack range, which is still melee due to
their large size. <br>
<br>
###### Huge<br>
Munamochi-Saru cannot be tripped or knocked airborne, and any knockback
effects have their efficacy reduced by half. However, they also cannot
dodge or block.<br>
<br>
###### Tireless<br>
Munamochi-Saru do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls
when they act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation),
they have +25 to their rolls.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Actions<br>
Munamochi-Saru may use Move as described in the Combat chapter of the
PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. They may use Take The
Hit normally, but commanding them to do so costs 4 AP.<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Monkey Smash (Speed 10, 4 AP)<br>
The giant monkey punches, claws, or kicks those that it's set against.
This deals 14d20 Blunt or Slashing damage, and is considered a basic
unarmed attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Ground Pound (Speed 20, 8 AP)<br>
Balling up both fists, Munamochi-saru slams both hands into the ground
or upon a downed opponent in a hammering motion. Chakra is poured into
the ground and it shatters, opening up around the monkey before it hops
back out of the area. This strikes an area of 40 yards with a penalty
of -2 to accuracy. It deals 28d20 damage and is considered Unarmed
Taijutsu. If used on a prone target, Ground Pound's damage is
considered 150% higher for inflicting wounds. <br>
th a -2 penalty in place of Ground Pound's normal accuracy.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Tail Sweep (Speed 6, 5 AP)<br>
As Munamochi-saru are such a huge and imposing monkeys, most think of
them as apes. However, they are in fact still monkeys, and as such have
tails. A tail sweep usually involves the monkey feinting forwards
ominously with one arm, then whipping their tail out to sweep an
opponent off their feet. This attack only does 6d12 damage; if it hits,
the victim next gets an Awareness roll against the monkey's Accuracy.
If they pass, they suffer a Stun 2. If they fail, they're left prone as
per the E-rank Trip taijutus.<br>
<br>
Tail Sweep always rolls Accuracy, using 1d20+36. If it knocks someone
prone, the Munamochi-saru can pay 5 AP and immediately follow up with a
Ground Pound (at its normal AP cost, and adding its normal Speed to
when the monkey will act next) at that target, using its Tail Sweep
accuracy wi<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; Monkey Pillar (Speed 3+X, Interrupt, X AP,
Chakra 10+2*X)<br>
In addition to acting as living pillars, the Munamochi-saru are quite
capable of creating them. Driving their hands into the ground (be it
loose earth or solid stone), they can lift a solid wall or pillar in
front of them. Even if used on dirt or sand, the pillar will be
hardened into solid stone when it's raised this way.<br>
<br>
This is used as a defensive Interrupt, automatically succeeding and
blocking up to X*100 damage. Any damage over thi amount carries through
to the Munamochi-saru. This is treated as a Doton ninjutsu, and takes
double damage from Raiton, but only half from Sution. Anyone within
five yards of the monkey will also be protected by this wall. It can
only be used against attacks originating 10 yards or more away from the
Munamochi-saru.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The pillar-supporting monkeys are not dim-witted, but are still fairly
simple creatures. As long as the summoner doesn't ask them to do more
than use their brute strength and size, they'll get along just fine.<br>
<br>
The one thing they will never do is harm pure-hearted innocents, and
attempting to convince one to do so knowingly is a Breach of
Contract.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Summon Avatar: Enma<br>
<br>
1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Enma is an eight foot tall, white-furred monkey with a body structure
similar to a human, allowing him to walk upright and swing from limbs
like an ape. He wears a black suit with mesh armor underneath, and to
top it off a sleeveless kimono made of tiger fur with white trim and
held closed with a sash. He usually has a very grumpy look on his face.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 65<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 35<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Monkeys are somewhat fickle and it can be quite a complicated process
to gain their trust. That said, once the Monkey King has grown fond of
someone (a long process) he will treat them as a member of his monkey
troop and fight fiercely to protect them. That said, Monkeys have
plenty of better things to be doing with their time and Enma doesn't
like being summoned for frivolous purposes. <br>
<br>
Having grown quite old and cantankerous, Enma will only answer a
summons if the summoner's life is on the line. Where that line is drawn
is dependent on how well he knows the summoner in question. He also has
a long-standing unfriendly rivalry with the Spider Queen Tsuchigumo,
and will answer any summons to fight her.<br>
<br>
Enma does not generally take orders. He'll do what the summoner needs,
but will usually decide for himself how he wants to go about
accopmlishing their goal. The better the summoner's rapport with Enma,
the more closely he'll cooperate with them. If Enma has faith in his
summoner's abilities, he may even use his ability to transform into the
legendary Adamantine Staff, a weapon said to be indestructible and
possessed of numerous supernatural capabilities, for his summoner to
wield.<br>
<br>
In addition, Enma is well-schooled in the ninja arts and has an
extensive suite of ninjutsu he can perform. He actually outclasses many
ninja with his jutsu use. While other Avatars are immense beasts
capable of causing destruction on a massive scale, the Monkey King Enma
is smarter, more skilled, and able to become an undefeatable weapon in
the right hands.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Salamander Contract<br>
Unlike many of the other creatures a Shinobi might form a contract
with, Salamanders care little for the summoners. They come when called,
but that's about it; they can't (or at least don't) speak, and while
they're never reluctant to help in battle, nor are they eager. They go
about it as a matter of course, suggesting perhaps a still very bestial
nature.<br>
<br>
While this means that a summoner doesn't have to worry about offend
their summon or incurring its animosity, it also means that salamanders
don't particularly care about looking out for their summoner. In combat
they can be frightening indiscriminate in the devastation they unleash.
An unprepared summoner can easily get themselves or their allies wiped
out by collateral damage.<br>
<br>
To counteract that, and perhaps as an indication that the salamanders
do have something resembling good will towards those who call on them,
before being able to summoner any of the creatures themselves a
summoner will first gain the ability to summon the blood of the beasts,
which has various effects which, when properly applied, can give them
some degree of protection from the creatures they call.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
Access<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; 1000 XP: Red Blood<br>
&lt;br&gt; 1500 XP: Black Blood<br>
&lt;br&gt; 2000 XP: Blue Blood<br>
&lt;br&gt; 2500 XP: Summon: Chameleon<br>
&lt;br&gt; 3000 XP: Summon: Basilisk<br>
&lt;br&gt; 4000 XP: Summon: Ibuse<br>
&lt;br&gt; 5000 XP: Summon: Ka Riu&lt;/text&gt;<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Akachi - Summoning: Red Blood )--<br>
You summon a small clay jug filled with thick, viscous red blood. The
blood from this particular salamander species is known for&nbsp;
its incredible flame-retardant properties.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If you take a Speed 8 action to smear the blood over yourself, you
become highly resistant to heat and fire.<br>
<br>
For the next 200 IC, you are immune to the Ignite status effect and any
ongoing Ignites will end. You become immune to Burns, but existing
Burns won't be removed. You cannot be wounded by Katon, and the
severity of wounds from para-elements based on Katon (Shakuton and
Futton) are reduced by one category. Finally, you take 25% less damage
from Katon or its advanced elemental forms.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Kurochi - Summoning: Black Blood )--<br>
You summon a small earthenware decanter filled with a pitch-black
liquid the consistency of water. The blood of this species of
salamander is poisonous--but, a single whiff of the stuff would be
enough to convince most people not to even consider drinking it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
If you take a Speed 4 action to drink the blood, you... are poisoned!<br>
<br>
This has a Poison 1 effect, with a Duration of 1000 IC. However, the
black blood blocks the action of any other poisons: while you can be
poisoned, so long as the black blood is coursins through your veins you
will ignore their effects, and their own durations will expire normally.<br>
<br>
You may purge the black blood from your system as a Speed 10 action, by
&amp;quot;unsummoning&amp;quot; it.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Aochi - Summoning: Blue Blood )--<br>
You summon a small wooden bowl with a tepid, syrupy substance inside
it. If you hadn't figured it out yet, it's salamander blood, said to
have mystical properties!<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may close your eyes and take a Speed 5 action to coat your eyelids
in the blue blood.<br>
<br>
For the next 100 IC, or until you open your eyes or wipe the blood
away, you can 'see' despite your eyes being closed, viewing the world
as black and all objects as chalky white outlines. While disorienting,
it's quite effective.<br>
<br>
You halve all visibility penalties for the duration, and are immune to
any effects requiring eye contact. Additionally, you have a +5 bonus to
all your Awareness rolls, as this unnatural sight eliminates most
visual distractions.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Summon: Chameleon<br>

5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Even normal chameleons were, in the past, thought of as being
supernatural monsters, so finding one among the ranks of summoned
animals shouldn't be surprising. Why the salamander contract covers
something which is technically a lizard, and not an amphibian, however,
remains mysterious.<br>
<br>
Aloof and uncaring like the other animals it shares a contract with,
the chameleon serves as ask and then leaves promptly. The chamaleon is
fairly small by the standards of summoned animals,
&amp;quot;only&amp;quot; big enough for two people to crouch
fairly inside its mouth with moderate discomfort. With long limbs, a
tail that ends in a curling spiral, and some of the strangest eyes of
any creature, the chameleon is certainly a unique sight.<br>
<br>
While regular chameleons can blend in with their surroundings, this one
can alter the color and reflectiveness of its skin so well as to be
virtually invisible. It can walk across virtually any surface, and
while it prefers to avoid combat its long, sticky, extendable tongue
can be wielded with stunning speed and deftness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Like most creatures summoned by the salamander contract, the chameleon
really doesn't care about its summoner. Unlike the others, it's
typically not willing to risk injury in battle, either. It has no
problem being near or even in a battlefield, so long as it's not taking
any sort of damage or having to defend itself.<br>
<br>
When it's summoned, the summoner may choose to
&amp;quot;bribe&amp;quot; the chameleon by increasing the
Chakra cost by 15. If this is done, it will stay and fight in combat,
albeit reluctantly.<br>
<br>
If not, the chameleon will flee as soon as it's injured. It will gives
its summoner up to 10 IC to climb into its mouth before doing so; if
carrying a shinobi, it will turn invisible and try to run away. If it's
not carrying anyone by the end of those 10 IC, it will simply un-summon
itself.<br>
<br>
If ever left to wait around (say, outside a building while the summoner
infiltrates it), the chameleon will wander up to 5d10 yards in any
direction looking for insects and small animals to eat.<br>

&lt;br&gt; Stealth: +30<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Agile<br>
The chameleon does not suffer AoE penalties for dodging area-of-effect
techniques, and indeed has a +5 bonus to dodge them.<br>
<br>
###### Bestial &nbsp;<br>
The Chameleon isn't driven by higher desires, and as a result it cannot
be negotiated or reasoned with. It has a +10 bonus to its rolls against
genjutsu.<br>
<br>
###### Expert Climber<br>
Due to a combinatino of chakra control, grasping claws, and small
sticky pads on its feet, the chameleon can climb along any wall or
surface, even upside-down, without any effort. Any immobilization
penalties it suffers from the condition of the terrain are halved.<br>
<br>
###### Flee<br>
When the chameleon is fleeing (see &amp;quot;Terms of
Contract&amp;quot;), it has a +5 bonus to dodge, cannot be stunned,
reduces all immobilization penalties by 3, and moves at full speed when
in Camouflage.<br>
<br>
###### Large<br>
Given the chameleon's size, it can make melee attacks at a range of up
to 5 yards.<br>
<br>
###### Tireless<br>
Chameleons do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when
they act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they
have +10 to their rolls.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions<br>
This Summon may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat
chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Camouflage (Speed 20, 10 AP)<br>
The chameleon blends into its surroundings, turning almost completely
invisible. While camouflaged it can move at only half its normal speed,
and is in Stealth 2. A camouflaged chameleon can Hide as a Speed 10 (5
AP) action, even if the normal requirements for hiding are not met.
When rolling for stealth, and dodging in camouflage, the chameleon
rolls 2d20.takeHighest(1) rather than 1d20.<br>
<br>
###### Swat (Speed 8, 5 AP)<br>
Using one is its legs or tail, the Chameleon swings at an enemy as a
last resort to get them away. This inflicts 8d10 Blunt damage and
counts as a basic unarmed attack, which knocks whoever was hit 3d6
yards away and.<br>
<br>
###### Tongue Lash (Speed 10, 8 AP)<br>
Spitting out its tongue in a frog-like fashion, the chameleon lashes
out and smacks a target with blinding speed. This inflicts 6d6 Blunt
damage, a Stun 5, and trips anyone who doesn't pass an Athletics roll
against the chameleon's. Used against any form of bug or insects
(including Aburame swarms and Spider summons) this attack inflcits
double damage. This attack has a 20 yard range.<br>
<br>
###### Wrap-Up (Speed 15, 10 AP)<br>
The chameleon attempts to capture and enemy with its tongue. This
attack has a 20 yard range. If this hits, the opponent has an
Immobilize penalty of 1 for every point their defense failed by (if
their dodge was a 31 against the chameleon's 35 accuracy, they'd be at
Immobilize -4). Someone hit this way cannot move more than 20 yards
away from the chameleon; the chameleon can move only at half speed
while someone is wrapped this way. This lasts until the chameleon takes
an action other than moving or dodging. The other way to escape is to
hit the tongue with a slashing or piercing attack that does more than
100 damage in a single hit, which will slice off its tongue (and cause
it to flee; see &amp;quot;Terms of Contract&amp;quot;).<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Carry (Speed 20 / See Text, Variable AP)<br>
The chameleon is large enough to fit two people inside its mouth and
carry them around; in combat, climbing into its mouth is a Speed 10
action that requires the person to be standing directly next to the
chameleon, while it's a Speed 20 action for the chameleon to safely
close its mouth around them. There's enough air to last one person ten
minutes, or two people five minutes. After this time is up, the people
inside suffer a Suffocation 1 every 5 IC until the chameleon opens its
mouth.<br>
<br>
With its mouth open, the benefits of camouflage are suspended (reduced
to stealth one, doesn't roll 2d20, cannot hide in plain sight, but it
does not break stealth if already hidden) and the chameleon can only
move at half speed to avoid spilling its passengers out. Out of combat
this takes less than a minute; in combat, it takes 30 IC for the air
supply to be replenished.<br>
<br>
Ordering the chameleon to move while in its mouth is 1 AP for every 5
IC the chameleon spends moving, and it cannot make tongue attacks
(Tongue Lash and Wrap-Up) while carrying someone in its mouth.<br>
<br>
Being inside the chameleon's mouth makes it generally impossible to
affect the outside world, and imposes a complete loss of visibility,
with one exception. Someone using the blue blood can see through the
chameleon's mouth, and view the outside world.9<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The chameleon will flee under the following circumstances:<br>
&nbsp;- It wasn't bribed, and it takes any damage.<br>
&nbsp;- Its Vitality falls below 25%.<br>
&nbsp;- Its tongue is cut off.<br>
<br>
When it decides to flee, the summoner has 10 IC to get into its mouth
before it does so. If it has no passengers at that point, it un-summons
itself. If it does, it enters camouflage as a Speed 0 action and will
no longer take orders from the summoner, and does not use the
summoner's AP.<br>
<br>
If the chameleon has its tongue cut off while using its Wrap-Up
ability, that summoner cannot summon a chameleon again for the next 2
OOC weeks, although this is not considered to be a Breach of Contract
for salamanders as a whole.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Summon: Basilisk<br>

4. Abilities<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Basilisks bear a very strong resemblance to the very much mundane
komodo dragon, four legs bowed out nearly parallel to the ground,
leaving it to drag its belly across the ground for most of its
movements while also able to rise up for a shockingly fast run.<br>
<br>
The first difference is that the basically is about as tall as a shed,
and proportionately longer. The second is its coloration. The
basilisk's hide, while leathery to the touch, is iridescent in
coloration, ranging from midnight blue to nearly shining cyan depending
on the angle one views it from. It is, most people agree, and
incredibly beautiful sight to behold... for the few moments one can
view it.<br>
<br>
Legends say that the basilisk's gaze can turn a person to stone, and in
reality it at the very least causes a disturbingly similar effect.
Nobody's sure exactly what causes this (it being rather difficult to
test without... turning to stone), but what is known is that not
looking at the creature, and specifically avoiding seeing its eyes, is
able to prevent this effect.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Like most salamanders, the basilisk is uncaring in combat. The deadly
gaze of the beast is as harmful as the summoner to all others, and the
basilisk won't take any special care to avoid petrifying the one who
called it into battle.<br>
<br>
In combat its preferred tactic is simply to petrify everyone in sight,
but if anyone gets too close or attacks it, it's capable of lashing out
with tooth, claw, and tail. Additionally, people failing to meet its
gaze can make it irritable and aggressive<br>
<br>

&lt;br&gt; Awareness: +20<br>
&lt;br&gt; Resistance: +20<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Bestial<br>
The Basilisk isn't driven by higher desires like many other summons
(and ninja), as a result it cannot be bribed or reasoned with. It has a
+10 bonus to its defenses aginst any form of genjutsu.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Thick Hide<br>
Basilisks have a Damage Reduction of 60.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Large<br>
Given the Basilisk's building-smashing size, it can make melee attacks
at a range of up to 10 yards. Humans, and summons without the Large or
Huge attributes, cannot grapple the basilisk.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Obvious<br>
Basilisks are giant amphibians with iridescent skin. They cannot hide.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Petrifying Gaze<br>
Anyone within 50 yards of the basilisk is vulnerable to being petrified
by its gaze, includin the summoner. Whenever someone see it, they begin
to turn to stone. Every 10 IC they have their Petrify status increased
by 1; there is no direct defense, resistance roll, or immunity allowed
to this, except as described below.<br>
<br>
There are three ways to avoid this. The first is to keep one's eyes
closed, applying a -10 visibility penalty. The second is to keep one's
eyes focused on the basilisk's feet, applying only a -4 visibility
penalty, though comes with a risk. If a ninja is damaged by an attack
while doing this, they have a (damage taken /10)% chance to have their
Petrify status increased by 1. The final method is for the basilisk or
the summoner to be at a -6 visibility penalty.<br>
<br>
If one stops using one of those methods, their Petrify immediately
increases by 1, and the &amp;quot;every 10 IC&amp;quot; for
that individual begins taking place based on that time.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Petrify<br>
This is a special status effect. Petrify also applies an Immobilization
penalty equal to its rank, which cannot be reduced by effects which
explicitly reduce immobilization. Once a person's Petrification status
reaches 10 they turn to solid stone over the next several seconds,
killing them irrevocably. At lower ranks its manifests as an
increasingly severe stiffness and numbness across one's entire body.<br>
<br>
In addition, once Petrify reaches 3, the victim's Elemental Affinity is
shifted to Doton. If this was already their elemental affinity, it has
no effect. If it was not, they also receive a penalty equal to their
Elemental Affinity rank to all non-Doton Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra
Control rolls.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
For example, if you had rank 4 Elemental Affinity: Fire, once your
Petrify reached 3 you would have a +4 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and
Chakra Control rolls with Doton, and a -4 to all others--including
those related to non-elemental jutsu.<br>
<br>
After 50 IC of not having one's Petrify status increase, it begins to
fade at a rate of 1 per 20 IC. Once applied, the change to elemental
affinity will take 24 hours to be reversed.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions (Speed as normal)<br>
A Basilisk may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat
chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Fang and Claw (Speed 6, 5 AP)<br>
The Basilisk charges, moving up to 10 yards and making a melee range
attack with its fangs or claws inflicting 10d10 Piercing or Slashing
damage. This counts as a basic unarmed attack, and may target up to
three people in its range. If directed against a single target, the
basilisk's damage bonus is increased by 50%.<br>
<br>
###### Stone Glare (Speed 10, 25 AP, Chakra 25)<br>
The basilisk's eyes widen, its scales shimmer, and... something,
happens. Everyone within 50 yards of the basilisk has their Petrify
status raised by 1, even if they're not looking at it. This will also
turn small animals and plants to stone; after three uses, an entire
area is petrified: the ground has become solid rocks, trees are stone
through and through, and any low-flying birds will fall from the sky.
Water is safe from the effects, but aquatic life is not.<br>
<br>
###### Tail Sweep (Speed 10, 8 AP)<br>
Swinging its large and powerful tail like a scythe, the Basilisk clears
the area behind and around it. This counts as an Area 10 attack that
deals 15d8 Blunt damage and inflicts Stun 6, as well as a 12 yard
knockback. The basilisk will often lunge forwards (moving as part of
the attack, in this case, not being limited to &amp;quot;directly
towards&amp;quot; the target) before using this, allowing it to
catch people who were directly to its sides.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The basilisk is a fairly simple creature, showing up and causing havoc;
it's intelligent, but without complex desires. It requires little of
its summoner, but its gaze is as liable to destroy its summoner as it
is their enemies.<br>
<br>
There is one condition that can be troublesome. If the basilisk is
present when a fight ends (it cannot be dismissed after one side has
surrendered or stood down, or the last blow has been dealt), it will
not be possible to de-summon the creatures until it's had the
opportunity to consume the flesh of its foes, preferring the
living-but-injured over the dead (and it will eat corpses of allies as
well). The basilisk will only leave after eating 2d10 people, or
running out of appropriate food. It won't eat anyone who is alive and
also never injured it during battle. Anyone who tries to stop it,
including the summoner, will become next on the menu.<br>
<br>
Removing the bodies also counts as trying to stop it. Doing this, in
addition to causing the basilisk to try to eat the offending party,
constitutes breach of contract if the summoner is involved in it or
fails to help the basilisk drive off whoever's interfering.<br>

5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ibuse is an enormous purple-grey beast, large enough to swallow a small
house between its jaws. He has a pair of small, dark, beady eyes that
often go unnoticed, and his skin is always slightly moist. His thick,
damp hide has an almost flabby texture.<br>
<br>
What's particularly unusual about Ibuse is that he is, so to say,
'unique'--in the same sense that there is only one avatar for any given
contract, there is only one Ibuse; it's a name, not a title or a
description. Additionally, of all the salamander summons he is the
least bestial in outlook, demonstrating genuine good will towards his
summoner, and even growing attached to those who call on him frequently
(without abusing that good will).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ibuse is far more agreeable than other salamanders, doing his best to
follow the summoner's orders to the letter. Unlike other salamanders he
will actually form a bond with its summoners, though he still can't
communicate... and given the standoffish nature of salamanders as a
whole, this means that Ibuse is agreeable and willingly helpful, not
actually 'friendly' by most standards.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, he's still a large, clumsy beast, and still incapable of
speech. Furthermore, his main method of attack is fairly
uncontrollable, meaning that there's actually very little Ibuse can do
to avoid inadvertently harming a summoner who isn't sufficiently
prepared.<br>

###### Amphibian<br>
Ibuse takes only 25% damage from Suiton techniques; any techniques or
advanced elemental natures incorporating Suiton deal only 50% damage.<br>
<br>
###### Spongey<br>
Ibuse has very slippery skin, as well as pourous, spongy flesh. Blunt
attacks deal only 25% damage, Piercing attacks do only 50% damage, and
Katon does 75% damage (though advanced natures using it still deal full
damage). He is immune to Burns and Ignite. He cannot be grappled, even
by summons prodigiously large enough to accomplish that feat.<br>
<br>
###### Huge<br>
Ibuse cannot dodge area-of-effect attacks; instead, he automatically
blocks them as a Speed 0 defense. Ibuse cannot hide (via stealth) due
to being enormous. He cannot be knocked airborne, and any knockback
effects have their efficacy reduced by half.<br>
<br>
###### Thick Skin<br>
Ibuse has a Damage Reduction of 100.<br>
<br>
###### Tireless<br>
Ibuse does not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when it
act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have
+15 to their rolls.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions<br>
Ibuse may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter
of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Block (Speed 4, 2 AP)<br>
Ibuse may use Block as a Speed 4 Interrupt, even when he hasn't
declared that he's blocking for a period of time.<br>
<br>
###### Burrow (Speed 10, 5 AP)<br>
Ibuse dives underground, making a Stealth roll with a +10 bonus. From
there, Ibuse can move underground, covering 3 yards every IC spent
moving; area-of-effect techniques can't damage him at this point. Once
he's been located, an attack dealing at least 500 base damage will
break through to the depth he's at, ending this technique; he'll
automatically block the technique used against him this way.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###### Smash (Speed 12, 5 AP)<br>
Using his mass, Ibuse aims to stomp a target, slap his tail down on
them, or attack in a similar fashion. This is treated as a basic
unarmed melee attack with a range of 15 yards, dealing 10d12 Blunt
damage and inflicting a Stun 6 if its victim is wounded by the attack.<br>
<br>
###### Swallow Whole (Speed 8, 10 AP)<br>
If underground and within 5 yards of an enemy, Ibuse can be commanded
to try to swallow them. This counts as a Area 10 attack, and if it
hits, the enemy is swallowed up and trapped inside Ibuse's stomach.
While inside, the enemy is subject to stomach acid that inflicts a
Poison 10 status as long as they are trapped inside. An enemy traped
inside Ibuse can try to force their way out, damaging the stomach as a
target that can't defend itself but with all actions they take having
their normal Speed doubled (which does not increase their damage). Once
at least 1000 damage has been dealt to the inside of Ibuse's stomach,
anyone alive inside has broken out and can escape. After someone has
escaped from Ibuse's stomach this way, Swallow Whole cannot be used for
the remainder of the battle. This damage is not actually dealt to
Ibuse's Vitality.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
###### Poison Mist (Speed 20, 10 AP, Chakra 25)<br>
Ibuse opens his mouth and exhales a cloud of powerful, paralytic
poison, in the form of a frothing purple mist. Everyone in a 100 yard
radius of Ibuse has to make a Resistance roll against Ibuse's
toxicology, or be poisoned. Whenever someone enters the cloud, and
every 10 IC they spend in it, they also need to make a Resistance roll.
The cloud itself lingers for 30 IC, after which time it disperses.
Ibuse can only store so much poison at once, and it takes a while for
the chemical reactions that prime it inside his body to take place;
once this ability is used, Ibuse can't utilize it again for another 100
IC.<br>
<br>
###### Paralytic Poison<br>
###### Poison: 8<br>
###### Paralyze: 5<br>
###### Duration: 50<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ibuse is a very kind and caring summon, for a Salamander. So kind in
fact, that Ibuse doesn't even get mad if the summoner includes Ibuse in
area of effect attacks. Ibuse just takes the hits and keeps on
following the summoner's orders.<br>
<br>
In other words, catching Ibuse in the crossfire of the summoner's
attacks will not constitute a breach of contract.&lt;/text&gt;

## Summon Avatar: Ka Rui<br>
1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The beast known as Ka Riu is literally legendary--and according to the
legends, is a dragon made entirely of living flames, a literal force of
nature. While very few shinobi have seen the Salamander Avatar, the
general opinion is that they simply share a name. It's probably not
actually an immortal, primal incarnation of fire.<br>
<br>
It does, however, very definitely breathe fire, and there are certainly
people who claim that it can, and does, fly. Considering how little
information salamanders generally share about themselves, the avatar
probably just 'inherited' the mythical dragon's name due to
similarities (flying, breathing fire, being phenomenally powerful,
those things).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 40<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
In Ka Riu's eyes, all are equal. It torches anything and everything in
the vicinity where it's summoned. About the best a summoner can hope
for is that the resulting devastaion will be more damaging to their
enemies than themselves or their allies.<br>
<br>
It will accept its summoner's requests for where it should direct its
flames, but will plainly ignore any requests about trying to avoid
certain individuals or minimize collateral damage. Anyone foolish
enough to personally attract the &amp;quot;dragon's&amp;quot;
attention by injuring it will similarly have themselves, and their
surroundings, bathed in flames.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
\page<br>
## Slug Contract<br>
Slugs are a rarely-seen contract for several reasons. The first, their
temperament doesn't lend itself well to the shinobi lifestyle; while
they aren't pacifists, they're kind-hearted creatures that feel
violence should be used only after all other reasonable options have
been exhausted. The second, they don't tend towards spectacular
displays of violence and power, which are things virtually all shinobi
love. And finally, they're slugs. Seriously, who wants to brag that
they can summon giant slugs into battle?<br>
<br>
All that aside, the slugs themselves tend to be wary of most summoners'
intentions at first. Once they're convinced that the person summoning
them is similarly kind-hearted (which is not, by any means, the same
thing as &amp;quot;unwilling to fight&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;unassertive&amp;quot;--though it may in some cases go
hand-in-hand with those two) they become some of the friendliest
summons, not concerned with relative status or power like animals of
some others species.<br>

## Techniques<br>
### --( Neba no Namakuji - Slug Slime )--<br>
The summoner secretes a thin layer of clear, slightly glossy liquid
from their pores, covering their body with it. Despite being criticized
as a 'gross' technique, most users agree that it's really not that bad,
and just feels like being slightly wet, like having recently come out
of a shower. Then again, they summon slugs, so it's questionable how
reliable they are to begin with.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed:&nbsp; 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
All offensive grapple rolls involving you, including ones to remain in
control of a grapple, have a -X penalty; it does not matter whether you
are making them, or the other person in the grapple. Similarly, any
Immobilization penalties you suffer from for reasons other than poison
are reduced by 2.<br>
<br>
While not particularly dangerous to living tissue (which is good, since
the user is covered in it), this slime is highly corrosive to certain
other materials. Any time a weapon strikes you, its damage dice are
reduced by 1; when they reach 0, the weapon is useless and breaks the
next time it's used to attack anything.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Yakuyou Hiru - Summoning: Medicinal Leeches )--<br>
You summon a number of large leeches, which adhere to either your skin
or that of someone willing to have half a dozen giant leeches sucking
their blood (a rather small portion of the poulation). These leeches
perform two functions: the first, they return some of the extracted
blood to the host, but do so after filtering it, cleansing the
recipient's system of toxins. Additionally, they convert some of the
drained blood into chakra, which the person covered in leeches is able
to draw on in order to rejuvenate themselves.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15+X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Touch<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
A number of leeches appear on you and begin draining your blood. You
acquire a Bleed X status, which does not decrease so long as this
techniques is maintained. However, you receive a +X/2 bonus to Chakra
Exhaustion and Stamina rolls. The Bleed status from this effect of
Medicinal Leeches does not impose a Stamina penalty. X has a maximum of
double your ninjutsu damage bonus.<br>
<br>
So long as this technique is in place, more leeches will automatically
be summoned if you are poisoned. If you are suffering from a poison,
you suffer a Bleed Y, with Y being equal to the severity of the Poison
status itself; they persist until the poison is cured (either by
reaching its normal duration, or through other means, such as an
antidote), and then unsummon themselves. While this is in place, you
suffer no detrimental effects from the poison, though this Bleed status
does impose its normal Stamina penalty.<br>
<br>
You may apply this to another person only if they are willing or
helpless. You, or the recipient, may end the technique at will. The two
possible Bleed effects from Medicinal Leeches (one to improve your
Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion, and one to negate poisons) are
considered different sources of Bleed.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kakusan Satsusei - Acid Shot )--<br>
Much as it would suggest, you spit out a high-velocity ball of acid at
a victim. Contrary to popular beliefs, and all overused jokes aside,
this actually leaves the ninja using it with incredibly clean teeth and
minty fresh breath.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 15 + X * 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (2+2*X)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Unlike other summon techniques, you may use this any number of times
within a single battle. X is the number of times it has already been
used in that battle; thus, the third time you used it, it would have a
Chakra cost of (15+2*2) = 19. In addition to its listed damage, each
hit also applies Acid 5 (described below) to its target. The damage,
and severity of this satus effect, are reduced by partial defense
normally. Acid Shot deals Energy damage.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Acid (Status Effect)<br>
You have acid on you, eating away at your body! There's not much to be
done about it, and it's more painful than dangerous. Not to say that it
isn't dangerous--chemical burns suck like that. Whenever you take
damage from something capable of inflicting wounds, its damage is
considered (X*5) points higher for the purposes of determining whether
or not you're wounded, and what severity the wound is, where X is the
severity of your Acid status. Acid stacks with itself; two Acid 5 hits
become Acid 10. This increase is applied after all other alterations to
damage, including blocking, DR, and percent-based increases (or
decreases) in effective damage for dealing wounds.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Katatsumari Butsuden - Summoning: Snail Shell
Sanctum&nbsp; )--<br>
You summon the entrance to an enormous snail's shell (the entrance well
over ten feet around), which generates a vortex that sucks anyone
nearby into it! Because it's actually possible for even an untrained
human to resist the pull for the few seconds its takes for the shell's
entrance to disappear again, this technique is mostly used when keeping
someone safe from collateral damage is of paramount importance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 27<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 18<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This can target any number of people within its area, but they all must
be willing or helpless. They're transported to the inside of the inside
of the snail's shell. There's enough air to breathe indefinitely, and
fit a few dozen people comfortably (far more than could realistically
be fit into the technique's target area).<br>
<br>
The technique persists until the user ends it, or someone breaks a hole
in the shell from the inside (requiring a total of 2000 non-Piercing
damage to be done to it). In the former case, everyone appears within
10 yards of them, or the nearest safe terrain. In the latter, the snail
shell itself appears there, complete with gaping hole in the side; it
vanishes several seconds later, leaving the passengers behind.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Karada o Kyouda - Slug Body )--<br>
Not really a summoning in the proper sense, the user causes their body
to take on the spongey quality of a slug's. In addition to their skin
feeling rubbery, their muscle fibers and bones become slightly elastic.
The effect isn't extreme enough to allow things like squeezing through
doorways, or prevent normal combat, but does soften blows relying on
the application of brute force, and the user's rubbery body becomes
more prone to being pushed aside by dangerous injuries rather than
giving way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 22<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You reduce all Blunt damage by 25%, and stuns caused by attacks
inflicting Blunt damage are halved. Additionally, attacks which deal
damage types other than Energy do not benefit from effects which
increase their damage for the purposes of wounding when used against
you.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

## Summon: Leech Swarm<br>
1. Summoning<br>
2. Behavior<br>
3. Attributes<br>
4. Abilities<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Leeches are nasty little bloodsucking things, their rare and dubious
medicinal purposes aside. Nobody likes leeches; then again, nobody
likes slugs, either. While these summoned leeches are oversized, they
aren't absurdly so; a single leech could probably fit on an average
shinobi's palm with some difficulty.<br>
<br>
Of course, this doesn't summon a single leech. It summons dozens, if
not hundreds, of them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + Special (see
&amp;quot;Swarm&amp;quot; under Attributes)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 16<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
When it comes to following orders, the leeches have something
approaching human-level intelligence. They can't communicate, sadly (or
perhaps thankfully), but can be directed to prioritize specific
opponents or lie in wait in a trap.<br>
<br>
In combat, they tend to swarm a single target and adhere to them, at
which point they begin consuming the victim's blood.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Vitality: 150<br>
<br>
Movement: 1.0 yards per IC<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Anesthetize<br>
As is the case with many leeches, these ones suck blood! And, when they
do so, they secrete a mild anesthetic that prevents the bite from
hurting. Except these are ninja leeches, so everything's more extreme!
Someone affected by the leech swarm's Hemophagy ability reduces the
distance they can move in 1 IC by 0.1 per point of Bleed status caused
by that ability.<br>
<br>
###### Horde<br>
The leech swarm takes only 1/4 damage from single-target attacks, and
is immune to genjutsu. Area-of-effect techniques do full damage.
They're also immune to status effects other than area-of-effect
Immobilization, all single-target non-damaging effects (such as Trip),
and grapples. Finally, they treat the severity of AoE Immobilization
effects afflicting them as being 6 lower.<br>
<br>
###### Revitalization<br>
Keep track of all the damage done by the Bleed status caused by the
leech swarm's Hemophagy ability. When the swarm is unsummoned for any
reason other than a breach of contract, the summoner is healed for that
much. This healing will first fill their HP, then begin restoring lost
Vitality. It will not, however, take them above their maximum Vitality.<br>
<br>
###### Swarm<br>
For combat purposes the swarm is treated as a single entity, its
Vitality total representing the amount of damage that needs to be done
before the leeches all unsummon at once. Additionally, by using more
chakra in the summoning, more leeches can be summoned. A maximum of
(XP)/200 can be added to the Chakra cost. Every +1 Chakra cost gives
the swarm +30 Vitality and +0.1 yards per IC movement speed.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Standard Actions<br>
The leech swarm may use the Move action as described in the Combat
chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Hemophagy (Speed 8, 10 AP)<br>
This attack only be used when the leeches are at 0 yards range from the
target, and have been there for at least 5 IC. Leeches crawl up onto
the victim's body and begin draining their blood! The target acquires a
Bleed status that starts at Severity 1 and increases by 1 every IC
until they've moved at least 5 yards away. This Bleed has a maximum
severity of (the swarm's maximum Vitality)/50. If the swarm catches up
to an unfortunate victim again, another activation of Hemophagy will
cause it to resume increasing the Bleed's severity.<br>
<br>
This Bleed status does not decrease normally, and ignores effects that
prevent, remove, or reduce the severity of the Bleed status effect.
There are two ways to get rid of it! The first, every 50 damage the
victim takes from area-of-effect attacks, before reductions are
applied, will reduce the Bleed by 1. Secondly, the swarm leaving the
battlefield will cause the Bleed to end immediately.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Knowingly ordering the leeches to attack civilians constitutes a breach
of contract, as does attempting to use them to torture
captives.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

<br>
Slugs are the center of the contract and they work well as a team. They
have a powerful acid a when they swarm together they are a force to be
reckoned with.<br>
<br>
Of course, this doesn't summon a single slug. It summons dozens, if not
hundreds, of them.<br>

2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
When it comes to following orders, the slugs have something approaching
human-level intelligence. They can communicate simple motions by a team
effort of motioning around themselves.<br>
<br>
In combat, they tend to swarm a single target and adhere to them, at
which point they begin melt them down.<br>

------------------------------<br>
<br>
Vitality: 150<br>
<br>
Movement: 1.0 yards per IC<br>
<br>
###### Burning Bodies<br>
The slugs are coated with the same kind of acid they spit out and it
burns! Anyone who attacks the slugs with a melee unarmed attack gets a
little bit of the acid on their skin! This inflicts an acid two effect
as described in the Technique Acid Shot.<br>
<br>
###### Horde<br>
The slug swarm takes only 1/4 damage from single-target attacks, and is
immune to genjutsu. Area-of-effect techniques do full damage. They're
also immune to status effects other than area-of-effect Immobilization,
all single-target non-damaging effects (such as Trip), and grapples.
Finally, they treat the severity of AoE Immobilization effects
afflicting them as being 6 lower.<br>
<br>
###### Burrow<br>
Using their acid the swarm of slugs can burrow slowly through objects.
This counts as using the C-rank Moving Underground As If Swimming but
leaving it open long enough that one person can travel through it
besides them.<br>
<br>
###### Swarm<br>
For combat purposes the swarm is treated as a single entity, its
Vitality total representing the amount of damage that needs to be done
before the slugss all unsummon at once. Additionally, by using more
chakra in the summoning, more slugs can be summoned. A maximum of
(XP)/200 can be added to the Chakra cost. Every +1 Chakra cost gives

The slugs may all together fire their acid at a target. This uses the
Technique Acid Shot from the slugs.<br>

------------------------------<br>
<br>
Only found in the deepest and widest caves, this snail seems to be the
thing that carves the passages itself. It pushes it's way through whole
mountains and creates a labyrinth of caverns. Deep in the center is
it's home. A sentient creature, it can't exactly speak but can feel
it's summoner's mind and communicate with them through a telepathic
link. Naturally it is a gentle creature but when summoned it can be a
force to be reckoned with, mostly because of it's size.<br>
<br>
It's towers over two story buildings and can basically move through
them, it's mighty shell being a dark, nearly metallic brown color and
etched like the rocks in the mountains it breaks through. Gemstones and
geodes poke out from the different parts of it as they've been ground
into it's corners, a shimmering shell showing such splendor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>

&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Rock Snail has a bit of a personality to it, it will help the user
but will not go into salt water, nor will it go through fire. Despite
it's immense size it has simple fears.<br>
<br>
In combat its preferred tactic is to mentally stun it's enemies, charge
any the ones it can and crush them. If it becomes the focus of attacks
that actually begin to hurt it, it will withdraw into it's shell. If
someone ignites it, it will stay withdrawn until the ignite goes away.<br>

<br>
###### Titanic<br>
The Rock Snail cannot dodge area-of-effect attacks; instead, they
automatically block them as a Speed 0 defense. The Rock Snail cannot
hide. Multi-throws inflict half damage to The Rock Snail. The Rock
Snail is too large to be affected by any jutsu or effects that work by
binding or physically immobilizing them. They cannot be grappled by any
enemies who are not Huge or larger.<br>
<br>
The Rock Snail cannot dodge any attack<br>
<br>
Attempting to parry the Rock Snail's attacks requires either a Strength
of 80 or more, or an unarmed physical damage bonus of 10 or greater, as
well as both hands free. It can also make it's attacks at a range of 15.<br>
<br>
###### Tireless<br>
The Rock Snail does not need to make Stamina rolls for its actions. If
forced to for other reasons (such as Suffocation), it uses +25 for its
effective bonus to Fatigue rolls.<br>
<br>
###### Bestial<br>
The Rock Snail isn't driven by higher desires like many other summons
(and ninja), as a result it cannot be bribed or reasoned with. It has a
+10 bonus to its defenses aginst any form of genjutsu.<br>
<br>
###### Slimy Exterior<br>
When you roll to hit this creature with a taijutsu attack (Ranged OR
Melee) you have to roll 2d20 and take the lowest one for your attack.<br>
<br>
###### Gooey Center<br>
Basilisks have a Damage Reduction of 40.<br>
<br>
###### Telepathic Bond<br>
The Rock Snail cannot talk but can feel the mind of the summoner. This
way it can still communicate and will stay in contact with you at any
distance after being summoned until dismissed. This allows you to give
commands without breaking Stealth<br>

###### Mental Blast (Range 40, Speed 8, 10 AP)<br>
The Rock Snail has an incredibly powerful mind for a creature that
seems huge and lumbering, it can <br>
reach into the minds of ninja and disorient them. This isn't an
exceptionally powerful technique but using the Snail's genjutsu roll
you make an attack that if successful inflicts the target with a Stun
10. This has a -2 to it's attack every time you use it on the same
target in a combat, cumulatively, but each time it's successful on the
same target the Stun becomes 5 higher (Stun 15, Stun 20, etc.)<br>
<br>
###### Withdraw (Speed 4, 5 AP)<br>
This action can be used to bring the Rock Snail's head into it's shell.
It's Awareness rolls gain -10 and it triples it's damage reduction. It
can still attack but cannot move and if it uses Lurching Crush,
Withdraw ends and Lurching Crush's line attack is doubled in length.
Otherwise you can end Withdraw by using this action again.<br>
<br>
###### Lurching Crush (Delay 5,Speed 15, 12 AP)<br>
The Rock Snail dives forward as fast as it's slimy underside can carry
it. Making a rampaging charge, the Snail crushes anything that gets in
it's path. It runs in a 20 yard straight line, that is 7 yards wide,
dealing 6d20 damage to anything it goes over. If the terrain it moves
through is rocky then it gains 5 DR every time it uses this.<br>
<br>
###### Like a Rock (Variable)<br>
Being almost a part of the mountains, the snail can use all E-rank,
D-rank, and C-rank Doton Techniques. It cannot wield a weapon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Rock Snail is slightly a coward and will keep itself away from some
situations, but it will never abandon you until you dismiss it. It is a
loyal creature and feel that if you summon it you really need it's aid.
It still cannot be convinced to go into saltwater or to go through fire.<br>
<br>

## Snake Contract<br>
Snakes are one of the most maligned summoning creatures. They are not,
however, misunderstood in the least. Snakes aren't so much actively
malevolent or subversive as they are disdainful of all other creatures
(and even some of their own kind). They're quite honest on the matter,
too; while the weaker summons at least won't be openly disrespectful,
the more powerful they become the more likely they are to berate and
insult their summoner.<br>
<br>
The current avatar-class summon of the snake contract is unknown. A
hundred years ago it was Manda, a tremendous cobra who is said to have
died in the Fourth Great Shinobi War. Since then, nobody has mastered
the contract to the level necessary to summon the current avatar...<br>
<br>
...Or if they have, they just got eaten.<br>
<br>
Snakes do that, as it turns out.<br>

## Techniques<br>
### --( Sen'eijashu - Hidden Shadow Snake Hands )--<br>
This technique is one of the reasons people who use a snake-summoning
contract prefer to have long sleeves on their garments. You summon up
to three snakes which appear coiled around one of your arms and leap
from your sleeves to strike at an opponent.<br>
<br>
It's much more visually impressive if they seem to leap out of nowhere
beneath the sleeves of your shirt, coat, or similar garment.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + (Variable)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: (Total Chakra cost /4)d12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 12<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You may use this technique twice per day; the first time it's used in a
given combat, it's an automatic Sneak Attack. In future uses, it's an
automatic Surprise Attack. The damage dealt by Hidden Snake Hands
inflicts Piercing wounds.<br>
<br>
The effects of Sen'eijashu are variable: you choose which varieties of
snakes to summon, and modify its Chakra cost, damage, and effects
accordingly. By default, you summon zero snakes; you may summon up to
three, applying the Chakra modifiers for each snake chosen.<br>
<br>
These snakes inflict multiple status effects; all of these effects are
caused by that specific poison, and if it's cured they go away with it.
Unless otherwise specified in the individual descriptions, there is no
benefit to summoning multiples of the same venomous snake (their
effects and bonuses do not stack; Python and Black Adder are
exceptions).<br>
<br>
If you hit, make a single Toxicology skill roll using your XP/200 in
place of your Toxicology skill ranks, opposed by your opponent's
standard Resistance. An opponent who fails is poisoned by every snake
you used (but please review the rules in Status and Conditions
-&amp;gt; Poison before using this technique). Without further ado,
the snakes:<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Black Adder (Chakra +5)<br>
Your Toxicology roll with Sen'eijashu has a +3 bonus for each Black
Adder summoned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison 1, Duration 100<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Black Mamba (Chakra
+5)<br>
This technique begins with Suffocation 0. Every 25 IC, the Suffocation
status increases by 1 (provoking a Stamina 15 roll, as is normal for
Suffocation, from the victim). This suffocation penalty begins
decreasing only after the poison is cured or has expired (i.e. the end
of its Duration)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison 2, Duration 250, Suffocation (Special)<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Blue Krait (Chakra
+10)<br>
Your victim suffers an Immobilize with a severity equal to the total of
all Poison statuses they're suffering from.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison 2, Immobilize (Special), Duration 150<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. King Cobra (+10)<br>
For the duration of the poison, the victim has a -4 penalty to Stamina
and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and a -4 penalty to all their
non-Resistance skill rolls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison 2, Paralysis 3, Duration 200<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Pit Viper (Chakra +10)<br>
For the poison's duration, any Bleed effects on the victim will not
decrease naturally.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison 1, Bleed 3, Duration 200<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Puff Adder (Chakra
+10)<br>
The puff adder's venom has the unusual, and fairly terrifying, effect
of causing widespread cellular death near the site of the bite. If the
victim is poisoned, roll for location (unless a wound was inflicted
using Sen'eijashu, in which case use that location), for a Piercing
wound. 50 IC after being poisoned, the victim suffers a Minor wound on
that location. 100 IC later, they suffer a Major wound; another 100 IC
later, they suffer a Severe wound.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison 1, Duration 250<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Python (Chakra +5)<br>
This snake has no venom. Instead, your various summoned snakes bite
into the opponent and don't release them (or disappear immediately
after attacking, as the snakes created by this technique normally do).
The opponent cannot move beyond Sen'eijashu's range from you, and you
may, as a Speed 10 or Speed +5 (when used alongside a melee-range
attack) action reel them in, instantly bringing them into melee range
with you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Check for location if this hits (or use the
location of the wound inflicted by Sen'eijashu, if any); if it's a leg
or an arm, that limb is in a Leg or Arm Lock, as appropriate, as per
the D-rank Grapple Taijutsu. A person bitten by the snakes may attempt
to escape via the Break Grapple (but not Escape Grapple) action, which
is raised to Speed 6; you do not have to make a Stamina roll when
someone is struggling free, and use your CHA in place of your STR (as
the &amp;quot;attacker&amp;quot;). Each python summoned beyond
the first gives you a +5 bonus to your
&amp;quot;grapple&amp;quot; rolls.<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h. Taipan (Chakra +5)<br>
Sen'eijashu has a +2 Accuracy bonus. You may make Sen'eijashu a Called
Shot, with no Accuracy penalty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison 4, Duration 50<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
### --( Sen'ei Tajashu - Many Hidden Shadow Snake Hands )--<br>
An advanced version of Sen'eijashu, this summons a huge quantity of
snakes, usually on the order of dozens, which will intimidate, divert,
and attack their opponents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: +5 per additional target<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: +2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 16<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Sen'eijashu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This is essentially an upgraded version of Sen'eijashu, with increased
range and Speed. As noted, you may further increase Sen'eijashu's
Chakra cost to target any number of additional people within range with
your snakes.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, all effects (base Chakra cost, costs to add snakes, number
of snakes that may attack any given target) are the same as
Sen'eijashu. Each target is attacked with every variety of snake you
paid for.<br>
<br>
However, this is still considered a separate technique from Sen'eijashu.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Uwabami no Shoushitsu no Jutsu - Vanishing Python Technique )--<br>
A technique many users of the snake-summoning contract are hesitant to
use, mostly because it involves getting swallowed by a type of animal
known to have absolutely no compunctions about eating their masters.
Nonetheless, the snakes ensure their summoners that stories of
fatalities resulting from this technique are entirely fabricated.
Maybe. Only one way to find out.<br>
<br>
The head of a giant python rises up from the ground (without causing
any damage to it, even! how convenient) and either opens its mouth
allowing the user to step in, or just snaps its jaw shut and swallows
them before retreating back into the morass of chakra from which it
came, and vanishing as if it had never been there.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20 + X * 2 + Y * 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 24<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Oh my god two variables in the chakra cost it's algebra all over again.<br>
<br>
Y is the number of &amp;quot;passengers&amp;quot;, people other
than the user. If they are willing or unable to resist, it's a simple
matter of them entering the mouth. If they try to avoid it, the snake
swallowing them has only Accuracy 20. All passengers must be within 10
yards of each other when the snake is summoned.<br>
<br>
X hours later, the snake's head will reappear within 50 yards of the
location it was summoned at and its mouth will open, allowing
passengers to leave (or just spitting them out, if they don't). To the
passengers, it will seem as though no time at all has passed. For all
intents and purposes, they did not exist for the past however-many
hours. Attempts to reach them, communicate with them, or forcibly end
this technique early will all fail. If the area they disappeared in is
no longer safe, the snake will instead deposit them on the nearest
solid ground.<br>
<br>
X has a maximum of (summoner's total XP)/100, and a minimum of 1.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Kaikou Jisatsu Youshiki - Summoning: Suicide
Shedding Style )--<br>
You summon a giant, forty-or-more foot long snake which coils itself
around you in the blink of an eye, forming a protective living barrier
of sorts. By the time an enemy's attack actually arrives the snake has
already shed its skin and returned to wherever it came from, leaving
the discarded skin to crumble shortly afterwards<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Interrupt<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This protects everyone within 5 yards of you from whatever attack it is
used to interrupt. All damage and secondary effects which require you
to have been hit are negated. Suicide Shedding may only be used against
attacks used from more than 5 yards away.<br>
<br>
However, this summon may not be used again for (damage of the attack it
was used to stop)/100 weeks (OOC days), with a minimum of 1.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Superior Suicide Shedding )--<br>
The delay before you can use Suicide Shedding again is reduced to
(damage of the attack it was used to stop)/200 weeks (OOC days), still
with a minimum of 1. This is a permanent, passive upgrade to Suicide
Shedding, not a separate technique.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
A large purple cobra, with a body a bit over a foot and a half in
diameter, and well over thirty feet in total length. The upper side of
its body is dark purple, and its underbelly (along with the inside of
its hood) a pale, striated purple-gray.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
They look kind of like this:<br>
http://i41.tinypic.com/2pyw0zk.jpg<br>
But somewhat less adorable.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The cobras can talk, and they totally don't hiss their S-es. Well, some
do, others don't; it varies from one to the other. Some summoners find
themselves summoning the same cobra time and again, while others call a
different one each time. The common theory is that this is the snakes
just screwing with people (though they resent any such accusations).<br>
<br>
Cobras are highly critical of their summoners, in a smug fashion, but
will ultimately still fulfill their summoner's requests.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Vitality: 600<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; STR: 60<br>

<br>
&lt;br&gt; Chakra Exhaustion: +15<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Enhanced Smell<br>
The cobra halves visibility penalties to its Awareness rolls and
Accuracy.<br>
<br>
###### Hypnotic Gaze<br>
The cobra must be able to make eye contact to use any of its Serpent
Illusion abilities. As such, they can be avoided by someone who shuts
their uses. Never looking directly at the cobra works... sort of. This
afflicts them with an effective -4 visibility penalty, but snakes are
highly agile, and able to move in ways people wouldn't expect. This
doesn't confer immunity to its genjutsu, but does give a +10 bonus to
any defensive rolls against it.<br>
<br>
###### Sly Mind<br>
Cobras have a +5 bonus to their defensive rolls against genjutsu,
raised to +10 for rolls to see through already-in-place static
genjutsu. Anyone who fails to affect one with a genjutsu must
immediately defend against one of the cobra's Serpentine Illusions (at
the summoner's choice) with a -5 penalty, with the cobra paying no cost
(in Speed or Chakra) for this.<br>
<br>
###### Snake<br>
Because they are snakes, cobras cannot be tripped. Any immobilization
penalties are reduced by 5, and any reductions in movement speed from
other sources are halved.<br>
<br>
###### Venom<br>
As might be expected, cobras are venomous. Certain of their attacks
have a chance to poison their enemies, as will be described in
Abilities. It has the following statistics.<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emperor Cobra Venom
(Injury, Ingestion, Contact, Inhalation)<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison: 4<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paralysis: 2<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duration: 250<br>
&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicology: 25 (to be
used by a human)<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions<br>
Cobras may use Dodge, Move, Block, and Parry (unarmed only) as
described in the Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner
needing to spend AP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Bite (Speed 10, 8 AP)<br>
The cobra bites someone! This does 5d6 damage. If partial defense does
not apply, the opponent must also defend against the cobra's venom,
with the cobra receiving a +5 bonus to its Toxicology roll.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###### Constrict (Speed 14, 6 AP)<br>
A cobra can grab someone and wrap them in its tail. This is treated as
a grapple, but the cobra suffers none of the normal penalties for being
in a grapple; however, it cannot move while holding someone this way.
Every 10 IC, the person being constricted suffers a Suffocation 1 and
takes 5*(cobra's damage bonus) damage. The cobra has a +5 bonus to its
rolls to maintain the grapple. Escape Grapple cannot be used to escape
from a cobra's coils. If the cobra chooses to Bite the person it's
constricting, their defense has a -6 penalty.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Devour Illusion (Speed 15, 5 AP, Chakra 20)<br>
When confronted with a genjutsu, cobras can siphon the chakra
sustaining it out of the air and &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; it.
This works against area-of-effect genjutsu as well as genjutsu
affecting individuals, though in the latter case whoever has the
genjutsu on them broken also advances 1 Fatigue level. This may only be
used on willing individuals.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Serpentine Illusion: Bottomless Abyss (Speed 15, 10 AP, Chakra
30)<br>
An illusion which plays on two of the most primal, instinctive human
fears: falling, and darkness. The victim of this technique feels as if
they're falling down a dark, bottomless pit, the terror rising as they
anticipate the inevitable impact at the bottom.<br>
<br>
It never comes, of course--but the illusion is enough to leave people
reeling.<br>
<br>
If this technique hits, it inflicts a Stun 10 + 5 * X, where X is the
number of Willpower the victim is missing. Someone with 6 maximum
willpower who had 4 remaining, thus, suffer a Stun 20. If they are
missing at least half of their maximum Willpower (thus, someone with 3
out of 6 WP left would be affected, but not someone with 4 out of 7),
they also advance a Fatigue category.<br>
<br>
However, for every time someone has been affected by Bottomless Abyss
they have a +10 bonus to future defenses against it in that battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Serpentine Illusion: Coiling Horror (Speed 10, 10 AP, Chakra 15
+ 5 * X)<br>
This is a genjutsu which targets up to X people. Those affected are
placed in a trance-like state and unable to take any actions whatsoever
(with their IC advancing normally) so long as this jutsu lasts; while
it does, the cobra may not break eye contact or take other actions.<br>
<br>
Anyone held this way may make another genjutsu roll every 50 IC,
against the cobra's original result, with a cumulative +2 bonus. They
also break free automatically if they are the target of any attack.
However! This only applies to attacks from which they can feel genuine
malice (&amp;quot;killing intent&amp;quot;, in shinobi
terms)--a friend punching them to try to free them will, unfortunately,
not free them from the illusion. Anyone trapped by this technique may
spent a point of Willpower at any time to make another roll, with a +5
bonus (which is added to their cumulative bonus for future rolls as
well).<br>
<br>
Against anyone with 2 or fewer maximum Willpower (which includes
virtually all non-shinobi), the cobra does not need to maintain eye
contact to maintain the hypnotism, and can in fact mentally give the
victims any sort of non-combat commands (such as &amp;quot;go
wander out of town instead of guarding this building&amp;quot;).
Against non-shinobi, suicide is a valid command. (Certain exceptionally
strong-willed individuals may be able to resist that--but this is a
very, very small percent of the population).<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Serpentine Illusion: Spiral Grave (Speed 25, 25 AP, Chakra 40)<br>
This jutsu drives its victims slowly, if temporarily, insane. It begins
with a sense of impending doom, moving on to cold sweat and
steadily-mounting anxiety, then ringing noises and flickers of motion
at the edge of one's field of view, then difficulty breathing--and,
finally, the body begins simply shutting down.<br>
<br>
However, so long as this technique is in effect the victim knows the
direction and distance of the cobra who placed it upon them; it's
impossible for the cobra to hide from that person.<br>
<br>
Every 10 IC, the victim suffers a Suffocation 1, loses 5% of their
maximum Vitality (or HP if they have run out of Vitality), and suffers
a cumulative -1 penalty to defend against genjutsu. This will continue
indefinitely until the victim falls unconscious or the cobra is
unsummoned (due to taking too much damage, or for any other reason).
There is no other way to break this technique.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Venomous Spit (Speed 12, 10 AP, Chakra 10)<br>
High-velocity projectile poison! It deals 2d4*5 damage, ignores damage
reduction and blocking, and may be a called shot--if used as a called
shot, it has +1d6 accuracy. Someone hit by the spit must make a
Resistance roll with a +3 bonus or be poisoned. It does not inflict
wounds. However, if it's a called shot made at the victim's head, they
suffer a -8 visibility penalty which is reduced by 1 every 10 IC, to a
minimum of -4. Afterwards, it is reduced by 1 every week, finally
fading entirely after a month. As it turns out, having poison in your
eyes sucks.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
A summoner may ask the cobra to provide some of its venom. It will
offer enough venom to provide three doses. However, this is all it will
do--after providing venom this way, it will unsummon itself (not
staying around for combat, or to help otherwise); if it's already
performed some other service for the summoner, it will refuse.<br>
<br>
This venom will last for three weeks, after which time it is no longer
toxic.<br>
<br>
After being milked for venom, the cobra cannot be summoned for four
weeks.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The term is something of a misnomer. This actually summons individual
giant snakes, each several hundred feet long and capable of crushing
wooden buildings beneath them as they travel. These are long, brown,
non-poisonous snakes, resembling giant boa constrictors.<br>
<br>
The name comes from the fact that these snakes are able to fuse their
bodies together, while maintaining multiple distinct heads.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25 + X * 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15 + X * 5<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
You summon X snakes, up to a maximum of (total XP)/1500.<br>
<br>
In addition to the once-per-week limitation on using a specific summon,
you may only summon a total of (total XP)/1000 hydras in a two month (8
OOC day) period.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
The snakes are intelligent, but cannot speak. They understand
directions well enough, however, and are reasonably obedient. They may
ignore troublesome orders (like telling them not to attack that random
civilian who just threw a rock at them), but won't be deliberately
contrary.<br>

&lt;br&gt; Movement: 2.5 yards per IC<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Athletics: +15<br>
&lt;br&gt; Awareness: +35<br>
&lt;br&gt; Resistance +25<br>
&lt;br&gt; Survival: +20<br>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
<br>
###### Enhanced Smell<br>
The hydra halves visibility penalties to its Awareness rolls and
Accuracy.<br>
<br>
###### Extended Range<br>
The snakes have a 30 yard attack range, due to their immense size;
these are still considered melee attacks.<br>
<br>
###### Hard Scales<br>
Hydras have a Damage Reduction of 40.<br>
<br>
###### Huge<br>
Hydras cannot dodge area-of-effect attacks; instead, they automatically
block them as a Speed 0 defense. Hydras cannot hide (via stealth) due
to being enormous. They cannot be knocked airborne, and any knockback
effects have their efficacy reduced by half.<br>
<br>
###### Snake<br>
Because they are snakes, hydras cannot be tripped. Any immobilization
penalties are reduced by 5, and any reductions in movement speed from
other sources are halved.<br>
<br>
###### Tireless<br>
Hydras do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when they
act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have
+15 to their rolls.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions<br>
Hydra may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter
of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. They may use
Take The Hit normally, but commanding them to do so costs 5 AP.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Combine (Speed 0)<br>
This requires the hydras to all be within 50 yards of one another. They
physically combine into a single being, their bodies seeming to melt
together while maintaining however many distinct heads. This has the
following effects:<br>
&amp;gt; Damage reduction, remaining Vitality, and maximum Vitality
is combined.<br>
&amp;gt; Their Extended Range is changed to 20*(number of snakes)
yards.<br>
&amp;gt; Whenever they attack, thay may choose up to (number of
snakes) different targets.<br>
&amp;gt; +4 Accuracy, defensive rolls, grapple rolls, and skill
rolls, for each snake beyond the first<br>
&amp;gt; Smash deals +5d12 damage per snake, and their damage bonus
is increased by 2 per snake.<br>
<br>
###### Constrict (Speed 10, 6 AP)<br>
A hydra can grab someone and wrap them in its tail. This is treated as
a grapple, but the hydra suffers none of the normal penalties for being
in a grapple. Every 10 IC, the person being constricted suffers a
Suffocation 1 and takes 10*(hydra's damage bonus) damage. The hydra has
a +10 bonus to its rolls to maintain the grapple. Escape Grapple cannot
be used to escape from a hydra's constriction.<br>
<br>
###### Reflexive Block (Speed 4, 4 AP)<br>
In addition to being able to declare blocking normally, hydras may do
so reflexively as a Speed 4 Interrupt if their summoner spends 4 AP.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###### Serpent Strike (Variable AP)<br>
When directing the hydra's action, you may spend up to 10 AP improving
its Accuracy; every 2 AP spent this way increases its Accuracy by 1.<br>
<br>
###### Smash (Speed 14, 5 AP)<br>
The hydra tail-smashes, head butts, or just slithers over something,
with destructive force! This deals 15d12 Blunt damage, and is
considered a basic unarmed attack.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
\page<br>
## Summon Avatar: ???<br>
<br>
Presumably, there is an avatar-level snake summon. They're one of the
most powerful summoned species, and respect power (mostly just their
own) above all else, so certainly one of the creatures would have
asserted its dominance over the rest. Those few individuals who have
contracted with the snakes and gotten them to talk on the subject have
been able to confirm that the snakes do have an avatar, but nothing
more.<br>
<br>
It's reasonably well-documented (to the extent that anything about
summons is) that the previous avatar, Manda, required live human
sacrifices in exchange for not devouring his summoner--not because he
actually needed them, but simply because it pleased him to exert his
authority that way. Whether that will hold true for his successor,
however, is anyone's guess.<br>
<br>
Any information about this summon is probably going to have to come
from summoning it first-hand.<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>

## Spider Contract<br>
Of all the widely-known summon creatures, spiders have the greatest
stigma attached to them. Of course, that's in part because as a species
even ordinary spiders are much maligned. While normal spiders are
entirely undeserving of their reputation, being helpful by killing off
all manner of verminous insects.<br>
<br>
It's hard to say whether summoned spiders actually are as malevolent as
they're made out to be. They're certainly not friendly, and seem to be
utterly devoid of ethics or morals (amoral, not immoral)--they'll just
as gladly protect a village of innocent civilians as eat them all. Even
shinobi who can summon them are incapable of giving any meaningful
characteriations of the creatures they call on; more than any other
summoned animal, the minds of the spiders are alien to humans.<br>
<br>
That, really, is what makes them so frightening.<br>
<br>
Though the poison plays a role too, to be fair.<br>

## Techniques<br>
### --( Orisu - Web Weaving )--<br>
You summon a supernaturally resilient, sticky, and large spider web. In
the case of (relatively) smaller ones, the user actually spits these
out as projectiles towards the targets. Larger ones appear above, and
fall down onto, the area being covered in webs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 20 + X <br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 10 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: X*2<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 14<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 10 + X<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This technique does not affect you or any of your spider summons.
Anyone hit suffers a -4 immobilization penalty, which increases by 1
every 10 IC, to a maximum of -10, so long as they remain in the
affected area. Anyone who dodges, or enters the area after it's been
created, starts with a -2 immobilization penalty (as they are still
inside the webbed area) which then increases normally.<br>
<br>
Every 10 IC spent outside the web, its immobilization penalty decreases
by 1.<br>
<br>
Alternately, you can remove the Area from this technique and target a
single person who is already suffering from this technique's
immobilization penalty. If they're hit, they're pulled X yards towards
you and their immobilization penalty is increased by 1.<br>
<br>
Unlike normal techniques, this may be used more than once per week (OOC
day). The total X values of all uses of Spider Web in a given week
cannot exceed CHA/2; thus, with 40 CHA, you could use X = 10, X = 2,
and then two X = 4, in the same OOC day. After each use, it cannot be
used again for X*4 IC.<br>
<br>
X has a minimum of 1.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Hikimado Jiraigen - Trap Door Minefield )--<br>
You summon a number of giant burrowing spiders beneath the battlefield,
which lie in wait for an enemy to pass over them. When someone does,
the ground collapses and they fall onto the waiting,
more-than-man-sized spider, which delivers a bite of potent venom
before disappearing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 20<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
When you use this technique you make a Stealth check with a -5 penalty;
anyone watching, or who approaches the area, makes an Awareness roll
against that. If they succeed, they'll notice that something is wrong
with the area (and could reasonably surmise that avoiding it would be a
good idea). If they fail, they don't know that there's anything unusual.<br>
<br>
While in the area, any time anyone other than you moves as part
of&nbsp; an attack, or spends 5 IC or more moving (total, in the
latter case; 2 IC of movement, followed by 3 IC of movement, would
trigger it), they must roll 1d3. On a roll of 1 they've walked over one
of the traps, and immediately make an Athletics roll as their 'dodge'
against your Accuracy (this does receive any bonuses and penalties to
defensive rolls), with a penalty to their roll equal to their current
Immobilization penalty (if any). If they succeed, they can continue
normally. If they fail, they fall in and are attacked by the spider.<br>
<br>
Falling in does interrupt whatever action they were taking (unless they
were just moving), in which case no costs are paid, the trap leaves
them stuck at their original location, and their IC is not advanced
based on the attack's Speed. The spider bites them before being
unsummoned, afflicting them with a Stun X, where X is the amount they
failed their Athletics roll by. You then make a Toxicology roll, using
your XP/200 in place of your Toxicology skill ranks, against their
Resistance. If they fail, they're poisoned; the venom of these spiders
is Poison X/2 (maximum 8), Paralysis X/4 (maximum 4), and Duration X*5
(with no maximum).<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
<br>
If used on an area where a web of Area 10 or greater has already been
created, the trap field has a +10 bonus to its Stealth instead of a -5
penalty, and its Area is changed to that of the web. A single use of
this jutsu has Y traps in it, where Y is the number of spider summons
you have access (up to a maximum of, normally, 4). You can perform this
technique from stealth without revealing your location.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
### --( Kumo Koushou - Spider Bite )--<br>
This technique temporarily transforms your canines (teeth, not pet
dogs) into a pair of large fangs and briefly 'summons' the venom glands
of a giant spider inside them. Then, in a rather unorthodox combat move
you bite down on your victim and inject them with the toxin; this lasts
only long enough for a single attempt, before the venom glands
disappear and your teeth revert.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: 15d12.open(6)*1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Accuracy: -10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: Melee<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Every point of Immobilization penalty that your target is suffering
from reduce this technique's Accuracy penalty by 2, to a minimum of -0
(if they're at -5 immobilization or higher), and it's damage for the
purposes of inflicting wounds is increased by 10% per point of
Immobilization (to a maximum of +100%). They still suffer all the
normal penalties for being immobilized.<br>
<br>
This is a taijutsu attack which inflicts Piercing wounds and ignores DR
and armor.<br>
<br>
If this hits, it poisons the enemy with either Black Widow or Brown
Recluse poison (chosen when you declare the attack). For your
Toxicology roll, use (XP)/200 in place of your Toxicology skill ranks.
If Brown Recluse poison is used, it's raised to Poison 3, and its
Duration is lowered to 500. If Black Widow poison is used, it's raised
to Poison 4 and the penalty to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls is
raised to -6. Antidotes for those poisons still work normally.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Shindakara Haki - Discard the Dying Husk )--<br>
You 'shed' your skin and in a blur of motion escape from your 'shell',
which is left infused with chakra and capable of acting independently,
as if nothing happened. This technique is best used to beat a hasty
retreat when in danger, as it leaves you vulnerable and also buys time
until your opponents realize what happened.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 60<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
You are moved up to (CHA)*(0.6) yards away in any direction, and
immediately make a Stealth roll with a +15 bonus; enemies who fail
their Awareness roll do not realize anything happened. You are then
immediately raised to Stealth 2. When you use this technique you lose
half (rounded up) your remaining Willpower, have your current AP set to
0, and automatically advance an additional Fatigue level (though not if
doing so would render you unconscious) after the Chakra Exhaustion roll
has been resolved. At the same time, all ongoing Immobilization,
Ignite, and Burn effects you are suffering from are removed.<br>
<br>
Your 'old' body is left behind to fight. It functions exactly as you
do, but you have no mental link with it. It retains all your equipment,
but cannot benefit from any consumable items (such as soldier pills).<br>
<br>
This technique can be used from stealth, without breaking your stealth
(though it will remove you from level 3 stealth). If an enemy finds you
while you're still hiding after using this technique, roll 1d2. On a
roll of 1, they found you; on a roll of 2, they found your shell and
believe it to be you.<br>
<br>
Your shell has all your traits along with Vitality equal to how much
Vitality or HP you had remaining when you used this technique
(whichever was higher), and is at the same Fatigue level you were at
before performing this technique. It can use any jutsu you knew, but
cannot spend Willpower and is considered to be Holding Back (as per the
ability) at all times (even if you normally lack the ability to do so).
It does not receive a bonus to Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls based
on its Fatigue. On the other hand, it's immune to poison, bleeding, and
suffocation. When its Vitality reaches 0, or it reaches the point of
passing out from Fatigue, it breaks apart and crumbles into a pile of
brittle chitin.<br>
<br>
This technique's Speed cannot be reduced. So long as the shell
survives, neither you nor it gain any AP.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>

2. Behavior<br>
3. Attributes<br>
4. Abilities<br>
<br>
====================<br>
1. Summoning<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
While still terrifyingly large, these spiders aren't
&amp;quot;giant&amp;quot; by the standards of most summoned
creatures--a person could fit three or four of them on the palm of
their hand without too much difficulty. However, also unlike most
summons, these calls forth dozens of the creatures. Rather than
appearing in a puff of smoke, they will, if the terrain allows for it,
come crawling out from under rocks, down from the branches in trees,
burrowing up from under soft soil, and so on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 10 + X<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 8<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 14<br>
<br>
This calls 20+CHA/10 spiders; this is your Swarm size (see Attributes,
below). You may use this technique multiple times in the same day, with
subsequent uses adding 2d20+CHA/20 spiders to your existing Swarm. You
cannot create multiple spider swarms. The X in the Chakra cost is (your
current Swarm size)/4.<br>
<br>
This technique can be used multiple times in the same day, unlike
normal summons. However, once the swarm departs or is wiped out you
cannot call another one for 3 OOC days (3 IC weeks).<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Despite being far more intelligent than they should be for something of
their size, these creatures are still mostly animalistic, and are
incapable of conversation or meaningful independent action. They can
understand and follow orders, and execute them rather cleverly, but not
much else.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Vitality: N/A<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Accuracy: 20<br>
&lt;br&gt; Dodge: +8<br>
&lt;br&gt; Damage Bonus: 4.0<br>
&lt;br&gt; Movement: N/A<br>
<br>
&lt;br&gt; Athletics: +5<br>
&lt;br&gt; Awareness: +10<br>
&lt;br&gt; Resistance: +1<br>
&lt;br&gt; Survival: +15<br>
<br>
###### Horde<br>
The spider swarm takes only 1/4 damage from single-target attacks, and
is immune to genjutsu. Area-of-effect techniques have their damage
reduced by (Swarm size)%, to a maximum of 50%. They cannot be grappled
and are immune to status effects other than area-affecting
immobilization and visibility penalties. They are also immune to any
single-target non-damaging effects (such as Trip and Feint).<br>
<br>
###### Swarm<br>
For combat purposes the swarm is treated as a single entity. It
has&nbsp; a bonus to Accuracy and d20 rolls of (Swarm sze)/8. Swarm
size is determined when the spiders are summoned, and raised by
repeated use of this summoning technique. Rather than having Vitality
like a normal summon, every 10 points of damage reduces the Swarm size
by 1. A single-target attack may not remove more than half (rounded up)
the Swarm's size in a single attack.<br>
<br>
###### Unnerving Presence<br>
The spiders are constantly creeping around, sneaking up on unsuspecting
foes--and have some eerie way of never being too far from their
summoner. Rather than moving, the swarm can attack (and be attacked)
from anywhere within (DEX /2) yards of their summoner.<br>
<br>
###### Web Body<br>
Despite being spiders, they're also ninja spiders! When these creatures
'die', they explode into a burst of extremely sticky webbing. Any melee
attack which reduces the Swarm size causes a -2 Immobilization penalty
on the attacker which fades at the rate of 1 point per 10 IC. Any
area-of-effect technique which reduces the swarm size instead inflicts
this penalty on everyone within (number the Swarm was reduced by)
yards. Anyone who has the Spider contract is immune to this
immobilization penalty. The penalty from Web Body spiders stacks
additively with any other Immobilization effect caused by some portion
of the Spider contract. If someone already suffering from Web Body's
immobilization is afflicted by it again, their existing penalty is
instead increased by 1, to a maximum of -6.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
###### Standard Actions<br>
The spider swarm may use Dodge as described in the Combat chapter of
the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP; however, since it
cannot actually move on its own, it is likely to suffer massive dodge
penalties against area-of-effect techniques.<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Detonate (Speed 4, X AP)<br>
Spiders explode into a mess of sticky webbing! This reduces your Swarm
size by X, and has an Area of X; it can be centered on any location in
your Swarm's range. If the swarm's last action was to use Poisonous
Bite on someone, and that person is the target of their Detonate, they
will be automatically hit. Detonate causes no damage, but inflicts the
Web Body immobilization penalty on anyone who fails to defend
themselves.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
###### Gnaw (Speed 12, 4 * X AP)<br>
The spiders swarm over the user and gnaw off anything that may be
hindering them. Their super chakra-enhanced mandibles can break through
chains, vines, or even webs. This lowers an existing Immobilization
penalty on the user or someone within the swarm's range by X. This
cannot remove Immobilization penalties based on the terrain (such as
Yomi Numa) or caused by wounds. &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; has a
maximum of the Swarm size.<br>
<br>
###### Poisonous Bite (Speed 6, 6+X/5 AP)<br>
The spiders swarm a victim and bite them, injecting venom and causing a
surprising level of immediate physical harm (they are, after all, ninja
spiders). This deals (X/3)d20 damage, ignores armor, inflicts Piercing
wounds, and causes a Poison (X/5) effect which lasts for 25 IC. X has a
maximum of the Swarm size.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
Unlike most summoned creatures, Spider Swarms will not 'care' if you
catch them in your own area-of-effect techniques.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 20<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
While terrifyingly intelligent, the Kyodaigumo isn't able to make much
use of that in battle: it's much too large to hide itself, and not
particularly well-equipped for direct combat. It compensates for that
by calling more spiders into battle for it, and seeking to overwhelm
enemies through sheer numers.<br>
<br>
While it will willingly participate in setting up traps and ambushes
for its summoner, and has no objections to patiently laying in wait to
attack, the Kyodaigumo is reluctant to use its Brood Mother attribute
or Egg Sac abilities outside of combat. It will do so if asked to by
its summoner, but 50 IC later if battle has not begun it will unsummon
itself.<br>
<br>
(As a note from the editor: Do not try to find ways to abuse this by
being &amp;quot;technically&amp;quot; in combat. I will not be
amused, and the spider's smarter than that anyway.)<br>

&lt;br&gt; Stealth: +5<br>
&lt;br&gt; Survival: +25<br>
<br>
<br>
###### Bestial<br>
The Kyodaigumo isn't driven by higher desires, and as a result cannot
be negotiated or reasoned with and has a +15 defensive bonus to
Genjutsu rolls. They are, however, fairly intelligent.<br>
<br>
###### Brood Mother<br>
Every Spider Swarm active while Kyodaigumo is present needs to be dealt
twice as much damage to reduce its size, and has its Swarm size
increased by 1d10 every time the IC reaches a multiple of 10. The first
benefit is lost if the Kyodaigumo is unsummoned, but the increased size
remains.<br>
<br>
###### Exoskeleton<br>
When blocking, the Kyodaigumo reduces incoming damage by 75% (as
opposed to 50%). Blocking is not less effective against weapons
(normally, it is 25% less effective).<br>
<br>
###### Web Body<br>
If the Kyodaigumo takes 75% or more of its current Vitality in a single
attack, it explodes into massive cloud of spider webbing. The Area is
equal to (Kyodaigumo's remaining Vitality before being hit with that
attack)/10 yards. Everyone in this area suffers a -6 Immobilization
penalty. Individuals with the Spider contract suffer only a -4 penalty.<br>
<br>
###### Web Walker<br>
If the Kyodaigumo is suffering an Immobilization penalty caused by
spider webs, that penalty is instead a bonus to its Accuracy, Dodge,
and Athletics rolls. It has a bonus to its Awareness rolls against
anyone suffering from such a penalty equal to the severity of that
penalty (so, if they had a -6 Immobilization penalty from webs, it
would have +6 Awareness against them). Its movement speed is increased
by 10% for every point of web-based Immobilization applied to it
(rather than reduced).<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Actions<br>
The kyodaigumo may use the dodge, block, and hide actions as described
in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of hte summoner's
AP.<br>
<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Egg Sac (Speed X*5, X*3 AP)<br>
The spider summons an egg sac filled with baby spiders, which
immediately bursts and releases the creatures onto the battlefield.
This may either create a new Spider Swarm, containing Xd20 spiders, or
add to an already-existing swarm. This cannot take a swarm above 100
spiders (any 'extra' are simply lost).<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poisonous Bite (Speed 14, 10 AP)<br>
The spider bites someone, and injects them with venom! It's not strong
enough to be lethal to most shinobi, though it's still far from
harmless. This deals 6d20 Piercing damage, ignores Armor and DR, and
inflicts a Poison 4 status for 100 IC if it deals damage--there is no
Toxicology or Resistance roll involved.<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Web Spinning (Speed 20, 15 AP)<br>
The Kyodaigumo may perform this tehcniques (listed in the Techniques
section of the contract), though it uses the listed Speed, has no Seal
Speed, and may only use it once per time it's summoned.<br>
<br>
\page<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
If there are any active Spider Swarms, it is possible to cause a Breach
of Contract with the Kyodaigumo.<br>
<br>
Specifically, if the summoner completely wipes out one of their swarms,
or a swarm summoned by another creature called by the Spider contract,
it will be considered a Breach of Contract.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

Using a series of tricks and illusions, the assassin spider is no minor
inconvenience. It can make the safest place feel dangerous, or the most
dangerous areas appear safe. It is small, smaller than even some of the
swarming spiders, only about a foot long, but it's bite is not to be
trifled with. It has immense front eyes because of the way it hunts, it
is a jumping spider! It's favored prey is the sneaky kinda...other
spiders...or ninja.<br>
<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
It keeps to the shadows, moves to stealth whenever it gets the
opportunity. It uses illusions to separate people and then when it has
the opportunity to get someone alone, it STRIKES trying to finish them.<br>

<br>
###### God of the Shadows<br>
Any attack the Assassin Spider makes from stealth is automatically a
sneak attack, and after making any attack the spider can roll a new
stealth and re-enter stealth, though at a -5 penalty.<br>
<br>
###### Web Walker<br>
If the Assassin Spider is suffering an Immobilization penalty caused by
spider webs, that penalty is instead a bonus to its Accuracy, Dodge,
and Athletics rolls. It has a bonus to its Awareness rolls against
anyone suffering from such a penalty equal to the severity of that
penalty (so, if they had a -6 Immobilization penalty from webs, it
would have +6 Awareness against them). Its movement speed is increased
by 10% for every point of web-based Immobilization applied to it
(rather than reduced).<br>
<br>
====================<br>
4. Abilities<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard Actions<br>
The Assassin Spider may use the dodge, block, parry, and hide actions
as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of
the summoner's AP.<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trap Illusion (Speed 10, 20 AP)<br>
This is a genjutsu that causes the target to 'want to be alone' for
some unknown reason. They will not disclose the reason to others, they
feel compelled to keep it to themselves. Every 30 IC, or 5 Minutes OOC,
the target gets another chance to roll against the spider. The target
will go as far as&nbsp; to escape their allies as fast as they can
to get alone.<br>
<br>
######&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fangs of the End (Speed 5, 8 AP)<br>
This spider has very specialized fangs, they are almost 2/3rds the size
of it's body so it packs quite the bite. Dealing 12d10, if this is a
sneak attack it inflicts a Poison 50 that lasts 20 IC.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
5. Terms of Contract<br>
------------------------------&lt;/text&gt;<br>
<br>
This spider is simple, give it a target and it will follow through in
finishing them. It will accept as much as a second target, but no more.
After defeating two targets it will dismiss.<br>
<br>

## Summon Avatar: Tsuchigumo <br>
Tsuchigumo, also known as Yatsukahagi and Ogumo (&amp;quot;Great
Spider&amp;quot;), is an individual or a position among the
spiders; it's not clear if there's only one Tsuchigumo, or if the title
is passed from one spider-ruler to the next. In mythology, Tsuchigumo
appears as a usually malevolent trickster who is confronted and
ultimately defeated by various heroes; sometimes they kill the spider,
and in others they demand a boon in exchange for enduring its trials
(and usually surviving one or more attempts on their life). Its actions
are typically presented less as the result of genuine malice, and more
a case of a spider simply doing what spiders do.<br>
<br>
Though Tsuchigumo takes the form of an enormous spider broodmother (at
least, in the memory of shinobi), it's said she can also assume human
form. She rarely likes to intervene directly in combat, preferring to
send her subordinates and children to handle those matters for her.
Tsuchigumo likely has strong associations with the earth (the name,
after all, literally means &amp;quot;Earth Spider&amp;quot;).<br>

====================<br>

<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 40<br>
<br>
====================<br>
2. Behavior<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
It's no secret among holders of either the Spider or Monkey contract
that Tsuchigumo and Enma have a long-standing enmity. More serious than
rivalry, but not quite intense enough to constitute hatred, the two
will go out of their way to confront one another when present on the
same battlefield, and will refuse to fight on the same side.<br>
<br>
While Tsuchigumo would be malefic by human standards, a more accurate
understanding of her behavior might be that she is amoral, or at best
has a sense of right and wrong incomprehensible to her summoners.<br>
<br>
====================<br>
3. Attributes<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
What's known of Tsuchigumo's capabilities come from a mixture of
hearsay and legends.<br>
<br>
It's said she's a shapeshifter and illusionist, with some degree of
command over the earth. If not wise, she is certainly cunning. She has
a reputation for being extremely difficult to reason with, not due to
stubbornness, but because her whims or reasons for acting are virtually
incomprehensible.<br>
<br>
When she does fight, as Queen of the Spiders she is capable of calling
upon her progeny in vast numbers.&lt;/text&gt;<br>
\page<br>
<br>
## Toad Contract<br>
The toads are a misunderstood group as a whole, alternately referred to
as a gang of thieves and ruffians by some, and being valorous and noble
protectors of the weak who're just rough around the edges.<br>
<br>
Both are somewhat accurate. The social structure of the summoned toads
bears more than a passing resemblance to a Yakuza 'family'. Much like
an actual crime syndicate the toads usually want nothing to do with
outsiders, but are more than happy to help one of their own. They have
no problem carrying weapons, and make use of them extensively in
combat; where exactly the toads are getting a supply of giant weapons
is a mystery to this day.<br>
<br>
And, much like the idealized versions of Yakuza syndicates, they do
have a code of honor. They don't prey upon the weak, they stand up for
the 'little guy', and so on. Most toads, despite being perfectly okay
with the sort of work ninja might call upon them to do, won't harm the
innocent or do have anything to do with genuinely 'evil' or malicious
actions. They tend to fit the cultural stereotype of the
&amp;quot;gangster with a heart of gold.&amp;quot;<br>
<br>
Like any well-organized group, they are expressly concerned with the
well-being and advancement of their own interests. A summoner is tasked
with become a fitting member of the 'family', and if he upholds the
same standards and ideals as the toads he'll be sure to rise within
ranks, gaining greater standing, prestise, and responsibility.<br>

## Techniques<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Fukugama - Summoning: Scroll Toad )--<br>
Scroll Toads are an anatomical impossibility even among summoned
creatures, which says a great deal. They're tall and appear seated
upright, and seem to be wearing an obi.<br>
<br>
Upon being asked, the toad rises up and reveals that the middle of its
body is actually a rolled-up scroll; that scroll can then be extended
and have any number of important things inscribed upon it, usually
summoning contracts, important seals, secret information, or forbiden
techniques. Once the summoner no longer needs the scroll any more, it
can be unsummoned.<br>
<br>
Alternately, the toad can climb into the summoner's mouth and somehow
reside in their stomach indefinitely, to be called out again when the
scroll is needed. How this works is unclear, and probably best not
dwelled upon.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 50<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
Each summoner with this contract is assigned their own unique scroll
toad, and unless a special deal is made with the toads only ever has
that one scroll toad to call upon. The scroll toad sticks around to do
its job (having things written on it), and then leaves or climbs into
the summoner's stomach (inflicting a Stun 40 on the summoner).
Retrieving a scroll stored this way is a Speed 20 action.<br>
<br>
Nobody but the summoner themselves can retrieve the scroll from their
stomach; if the summoner is killed, the toad will simply unsummon
itself. Normally, information on the scroll will be stored
indefinitely, but the toad can, at the summoner's request, wipe part or
all of the scroll clean.<br>
<br>
Once the summoner has decided he no longer needs the scroll, the toad
can climb out and will head home. After being unsummoned, the Scroll
Toad cannot be called upon again for eight weeks.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Gamagakure no Jutsu - Hiding in a Toad Technique )--<br>
A spectacular infiltration technique, if one that gives most of its
users some serious second thoughts the first few times they find
themselves using it. The shinobi summons a small toad and climbs (or
leaps, or jumps, or dives) into it; somehow the toad is able to bend
space in such a way that not only can the summoner fit into its mouth,
they can stay comfortably inside until the air supply runs out.<br>
<br>
All forms of detection and communication fail to penetrate the toad's
stomach; as a result the user is almost impossible to detect, but also
unable to tell what the situation in the outside world is.<br>
<br>
The toad gives the summoner a ride to a pre-specified location, and
once there (or upon a trigger condition) spits the summoner out before
unsummoning itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 35<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 30<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 60<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
A small diving toad is summoned.After giving it instructions the
summoner hops inside its mouth (...somehow) and loses all contact with
the outside world. Inside the toad the summoner cannot perceive, or be
perceived by, the outside world. Communication devices won't work,
Chakra Sensing will fail to penetrate the toad's stomach, and so on.<br>
<br>
The interior is humid and unpleasantly warm, but tolerable. There's a
48 hour supply of air, but the summoner will need to bring their own
food and water (drinking a toad's stomach acid is not particularly
advisable). While inside the toad's stomach the summoner will not
recover Fatigue or Vitality.<br>
\page<br>
<br>
The toad can be told to release the summoner on a number of conditions
(given to it before the summoner hops inside): it reaches a set
location, a certain amount of time has passed (or automatically after
air runs out), a specific person described in detail is standing in
front of the toad, or automatically if the toad is attacked (in which
case the shinobi will be spit out and the toad will unsummon itself).
More than one condition can be set, either in combination
(&amp;quot;at that place and at that time&amp;quot;) or as
alternatives (&amp;quot;at that place or in front of that
person&amp;quot;).<br>
<br>
A small creature, the diving toad is just slightly too large to fit on
someone's hand. It can dive up to 100 yards in fresh water, and can
stay submerged in mud or fresh water indefinitely. If attacked it
unsummons itself immediately.<br>
<br>
While being capable of speech, diving toads will frequently complain
that people &amp;quot;all look the same&amp;quot; to it. If
told to release its passenger in front of a person, that person must be
standing directly in front of it, in plain view, and within two yards.
Additionally, the summoner must be able to provide a picture of them or
have a very good description with two or more unique, identifying
features (which can lead to mix-ups, on rare occasions). Otherwise, the
toad won't be able to recognize them.<br>
<br>
The diving toad can only be summoned once every four weeks.<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Gamaguchi Shibari - Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind )--<br>
Classified as a partial summoning, the shinobi summons the esophagus of
a great fire-breathing toad said to live on Mount Myoboku. This is only
usable inside buildings, caves, or other confined areas; the esophageal
lining covers the floors, walls, and ceilings in their entirety, and
seals up any remaining exits. If deployed properly, there will be
hardly any time at all for the victims inside to escape, leaving them
trapped inside--a very unfortunate situation, as the summoner can then
control the toad's esophagus to move and ensare their enemies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 40<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 6<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 20, Delay 10<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 25<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Special: Can only be used in confined
areas/indoors/caves<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
The stomach lining of a giant toad appears and begins growing to cover
all passageways, extending outwards from the summoner to the full Area
of the technique. Anyone who hasn't exited the area by the time the
Delay ends is trapped inside; anyone able to leave before then escapes
automatically.<br>
<br>
By spending 5 AP, the summoner can direct the esophagus to ensnare any
number of targets trapped within (extending 'whips' of flesh from the
lining to restrain them if necessary), increasing each of their
immobilization penalties by 1. This may be done up to once every 5 IC,
and does not require any actual action on the summoner's part, though
does necessitate a Chakra 10 roll.<br>
<br>
Those trapped can take a Speed 10, Stamina 15 action to pull themselves
free, reducing the immobilization penalty from Toad Mouth Bind by 2.<br>
<br>
The linings of the esophagus are extremely resilient, with each square
meter (an area large enough for a person to squeeze out of) having 500
HP, and a DR of 200 which applies against Katon, Blunt, and
multi-throwing attacks, as well as regenerating 200 Hp every 10 IC.
Toad Mouth Bind can be used once every 2 months (8 OOC days).<br>
\page<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Kekkai: Gama Hyoro - Barrier Gourd Prison )--<br>
This technique generates a powerful spatial barrier centered around the
user which transports anyone caught in it (including the user
themselves) into the stomach of a gourd toad: a massive, cavernous area
filled with a lake of corrosive gastric acid, and, for some reason,
many small partially-digested buildings still standing within it.<br>
<br>
The only way to escape is to defeat the summoner, convince them to end
the technique, or wait until its duration ends--and neither of the last
two tend to be all that effective.<br>
<br>
At the location where this technique was used a large, black kanji for
&amp;quot;oil&amp;quot; is imprinted on the ground; when the
technique ends, that mark vanishes and the stomach's previous occupants
are deposited in the nearest relatively safe (so, not on fire, covered
in spikes, directly under a net, or so on) area within a hundred yards.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: 45<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Upkeep: 4<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 50<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 20<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: 15<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 30<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
As soon as it activates, this technique automatically transports anyone
within its Area, centered on the user, to the gourd toad's stomach; the
user may choose not to activate this aspect of it (though they will
always be transported there themselves), but it's all-or-nothing; they
can take everyone within 20 yards of themselves, or nobody.<br>
<br>
Additionally, they may target up to one person within its range, with
+4 Accuracy and ignoring any Fatigue penalties the user currently
suffers from. A giant toad's tongue lashes out from the spot the
summoner vanished at, snatches that person up, and pulls them into the
spatial distortion.<br>
<br>
This technique will last a maximum of five minutes. Until then, it is
impossible for anyone to enter or exit the toad's stomach.<br>
<br>
As long as this isn't the summoner's first time being inside, they have
a home field advantage. This gives them a +3 bonus to Accuracy,
defense, Awareness, and Stealth while inside the stomach. If somebody
is knocked back or thrown more than 3 yards they'll be knocked into the
acid, suffering a Stun 10 and taking Xd10 energy damage (with no damage
bonus applied), where X is the number of IC which pass before their
next action (at which point they are assumed to pull themself out of
the acid). Water walking does not function on this stomach acid.<br>
<br>
Toad Gourd Prison may only be used once every 3 months (12 OOC days).<br>
<br>

<br>
### --( Kuchiyose: Yatai Kuzushi no Jutsu - Summoning: Food Cart
Destroying Technique )--<br>
It is unclear where this technique earned its name, as using it to
destroy a food cart would be overkill of the highest degree. A giant,
several-story-tall toad is summoned in mid-air above the unfortunate
victim of this technique, and proceeds to fall on top of them. While
this isn't the quickest method of deploying a summon, or attacking an
enemy, available, it's hard to rival its ability to cause wide-area
destruction.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Chakra: X (Minimum 30, Maximum 60)<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Speed: X/2, Delay X/3<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Damage: Xd12.open(6)*1<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Range: 100<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Area: 80<br>
&nbsp; -&nbsp; Seal Speed: 50 <br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
This may only be used if a Kyodai is available to be summoned. It
replaces the normal Speed and Seal Speed for doing so.<br>
<br>
A Kyodai is summoned X*5 yards above the target (make the Chakra
Exhaustion roll for the summon after Food Cart Destroyer's); from there
gravity does its thing, and the toad falls. This technique has a damage
bonus of 0, but anyone who is still in its area when the Delay ends is
automatically hit. The summoned toad takes no damage, and may act after
they hit the ground.&lt;/text&gt;<br>

Guardian Toads are chest-high on a man, which, given the squat nature
of the species, makes them quite bulky. They're large enough for a
person to ride on, at least in theory, though will not allow their
summoners to do so; it would be disrespectful, and they're guardians
and enforcers, not horses.<br>
<br>
Guardians can range in color from bright orange and green to washed-out
browns and yellows, and any number of shades inbetween. More often than
not Guardians are summoned into battle, so they come appropriately
equipped for combat, outfitted in metal armor and ready to exhibit
their exceptional taijutsu skill.<br>
