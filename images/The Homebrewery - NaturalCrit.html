 </div></div><div class="phb" id="p3" data-reactid="151"><p>====================</p>
<h2 id="1-explanation">1. Explanation</h2>
<p>This is a bare-bones walkthrough for character creation. It's best if you're at least partly familiar with the PHB before making your character, but you can get by without that.</p>
<p>The first step of making a character should be settling on a concept: if you're familiar with the series, you may already know which village or clan you want to be from. If you already have a concept (who your character is, where they're from, what their personality's like, what they're good at) then most of creation should be easy for you.</p>
<p>If you don't, feel free to just make it up as you go along. You might find inspiration along the way, especially if it's your first time making a character. Don't be afraid to ask for help!</p>
<p>Please note that when rolling your attributes, you need to find a Roll Watcher (RW), Storyteller (ST), or Gamemaster (GM) can be recorded in the game's roster. You will also need to inform the RW of your chosen clan and Creation Uniques (see below).</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h2 id="2-village-and-clan">2. Village and Clan</h2>
<p>First, choose which of the three playable Hidden Villages your character is from. This is where your character was trained, who they're loyal to, and ultimately who they work for. The culture between villages does vary, and you may want to read the Village Information nodes, but for the most part it's okay if you don't fit the mold of your home village--ninja are expected to be a little... odd.</p>
<p>Every village is home to several ninja clans. Clans have special techniques dependent on their bloodline or closely-guarded secrets, which you won't be able to learn otherwise. If you want, you may choose a single clan from your village to be from.</p>
<p>Choosing a clan is not mandatory, and clanless characters receive a 10% XP bonus--something that's discussed in detail in the Advancement chapter--and slightly more skill points.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h2 id="3-choose-uniques">3. Choose Uniques</h2>
<p>As a starting character, you have 4 Unique Points (UP) to spend, unless your clan specifies you have less. You may spend these all at creation, or save some (or even all) of them for later use if you prefer. You'll get more UP later, but they're few and far between, and the Creation uniques may only be purchased with your starting UP.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h2 id="4-pick-attributes">4. Pick Attributes</h2>
<p>The next step is to determine your five core attributes: Strength (STR), Resilience (RES), Chakra (CHA), Dexterity (DEX), and Agility (AGI).</p>
<p>You start with 20 in all stats. </p>
<p>After that, you have 25 points to distribute among the attributes, with no more than ten in a single stat.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h2 id="5-starting-skills">5. Starting Skills</h2>
<p>Unless modified by one of your uniques, you have (total XP)/25 Skill Points (which should come out to 4), which you can spend on any of the game's 10 skills. Now would be a good time to spend them, though don't stress about it too much.</p>
<p>If you're clanless, you have XP/20 Skill Points instead. That's 5, if you were wondering.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<h2 id="6-spend-starting-xp">6. Spend Starting XP</h2>
<p>You have three options for a character.<br>
a. 100 XP, but you get a bonus talent at 500xp.<br>
b. 1000 XP, but gain the Chuunin rank to begin. <br>
c. 1500 XP, Start as a genin.<br></p>
<p>As a starting character you'll probably want to purchase a rank of the Elemental Aptitude ability (in the Chakra category), and the E-rank Ninjutsu techniques Kawarimi, Henge, and Bunshin. These are by no means mandatory, but they're very useful to have. Some ranks in the Money: Requisition ability are also a good idea, if you want to be able to carry equipment with you.</p>
<p>Beyond that, take whatever you think makes the most sense for your character.</p>
</div><div class="phb" id="p4" data-reactid="153"><h3 id="1-primary-attributes">1. Primary Attributes</h3>
<p>Attributes (also commonly referred to as statistics, or 'stats' for short) are numerical representations of your character's overall physical condition: how strong they are, how fast they are, and so forth. They are the baseline for determining performance.</p>
<p>The five primary attributes make up, in game terms, the core of a character's capabilities.</p>
<p>Baseline 'normal human' stats are around 20. Ninja characters will quickly exceed these numbers. This is a result of them learning to harness the chakra in their body, and benefiting from the symbiotic relationship that chakra has with their body.</p>
<h4 id="strength-str-">Strength (STR)</h4>
<p>Strength is a measurement of your ability to exert physical force on the world around you. Exceptionally strong people may be correspondingly muscular, though ninja have developed many training methods which leave them deceptively lean.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your physical damage bonus is STR/15.</li>
<li>Your Vitality is (RES multiplies 8 + STR multiplies 4)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="resilience-res-">Resilience (RES)</h4>
<p>This is your body's ability to endure hardship without suffering from debilitating injuries. Many ninja believe that it's best to avoid being hit entirely... but nobody will say that not being able to take a blow is a good thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>RES/10 is your bonus to Stamina rolls.</li>
<li>Your Vitality is (RES multiplies 8 + STR multiplies 4)</li>
<li>Your HP is  (RES multiplies 3 + CHA)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chakra-cha-">Chakra (CHA)</h4>
<p>Every ninja is fueled by chakra, a mystical force that suffuses the world and fills the bodies of all living things, much like 'ki' in certain belief systems. This stat measures both your reserves of raw chakra and your ability to harness them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your ninjutsu damage bonus is CHA/15.</li>
<li>You add CHA/10 to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dexterity-dex-">Dexterity (DEX)</h4>
<p>Representing your deftness, precision, and ability to quickly respond to changes in your environment, dexterity is very important in combat, as it is what enables you to actually hit things that are moving (such as other ninja).</p>
<ul>
<li>Your base Accuracy bonus is DEX/10.</li>
<li>Seal Speed of jutsu you perform is reduced by DEX/10.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="agility-agi-">Agility (AGI)</h4>
<p>The sister attribute to dexterity, agility is how quickly you can react to danger, how fast you can move, and, as the name suggests, how agile you are overall.</p>
<ul>
<li>You add AGI/10 to your Dodge rolls.</li>
<li>You add AGI/10 to your Initiative rolls.<div style="margin-top:140px">  </div></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-top:140px">  </div><h3 id="2-derived-attributes">2.Derived Attributes</h3>
<h4 id="vitality">Vitality</h4>
<p>Vitality measures your character's ability to shrug off damage, to turn a dangerous blow into a glancing one, and to take a beating without being seriously injured. You have a current and maximum vitality; whenever you take damage, you reduce your current vitality by that amount, though your maximum Vitality is unaffected.
Your vitality equals your (RES <em>8 + STR </em>4).</p>
<h4 id="hit-points-hp-">Hit Points (HP)</h4>
<p>Hit points are like your 'life force', representing injuries that have significantly harmed you and caused serious damage to your body. After your Vitality reaches 0, you take damage to your Hit Points; an attack which depletes your Vitality has the rest of its damage carry over into your HP.
You have (RES *3 + CHA) Hit Points.</p>
<h4 id="damage-bonus-physical">Damage Bonus, Physical</h4>
<p>As the name would suggest, this increases the damage you do with physical attacks. Full details on how can be found in the Combat chapter. Your damage bonus is STR/15. Damage bonus is unique in that it is calculated to a single decimal place. For example, with STR of 25, you'd have a damage bonus of 25/15.0 = 1.666 = 1.6</p>
<h4 id="damage-bonus-ninjutsu">Damage Bonus, Ninjutsu</h4>
<p>This functions identically to physical damage bonus, with two differences. The first, it is determined by your CHA/15; the second, it applies to attacks based on their potency of your chakra rather than your physical strength, which generally means ninjutsu.</p>
<h4 id="willpower">Willpower</h4>
<p>Your overall strength of will. This is both your raw determination, and your confidence in your body's ability to keep going, and perform at a higher level, even when it, well, can't.
Your Willpower is calculated as (STR + RES + CHA + DEX + AGI)/100, with a minimum of 1.</p>

Please sit and tell us of what you have seen. The unheard of monsters, who slither and bite. Tell us of the wondrous items and and artifacts you have found, their mysteries yet to be unlocked. Of the vexing vocations and surprising skills you have seen.\r\n\r\n### Homebrew D&D made easy\r\nThe Homebrewery makes the creation and sharing of authentic looking Fifth-Edition homebrews easy. It uses [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) with a little CSS magic to make your brews come to life.\r\n\r\n**Try it! **Simply edit the text on the left and watch it *update live* on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Editing and Sharing\r\nWhen you create your own homebrew you will be given a *edit url* and a *share url*.  Any changes you make will be automatically saved to the database within a few seconds. Anyone with the edit url will be able to make edits to your homebrew. So be careful about who you share it with.\r\n\r\nAnyone with the *share url* will be able to access a read-only version of your homebrew.\r\n\r\n## Helping out\r\nLike this tool? Want to buy me a beer? [Head here](https://www.patreon.com/stolksdorf) to help me keep the servers running.\r\n\r\nThis tool will **always** be free, never have ads, and I will never offer any \"premium\" features or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>##### PDF Exporting\r\n> PDF Printing works best in Chrome. If you are having quality/consistency issues, try using Chrome to print instead.\r\n>\r\n> After clicking the \"Print\" item in the navbar a new page will open and a print dialog will pop-up.\r\n> * Set the **Destination** to \"Save as PDF\"\r\n> * Set **Paper Size** to \"Letter\"\r\n> * If you are printing on A4 paper, make sure to have the \"A4 page size snippet\" in your brew\r\n> * In **Options** make sure \"Background Images\" is selected.\r\n> * Hit print and enjoy! You're done!\r\n>\r\n> If you want to save ink or have a monochrome printer, add the **Ink Friendly** snippet to your brew before you print\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Big things coming in v3.0.0\r\nWith the next major release of Homebrewery, v3.0.0, this tool *will no longer support raw HTML input for brew code*. All brews made previous to the release of v3.0.0 will still render normally.\r\n\r\n## New Things All The Time!\r\nWhat's new in the latest update? Check out the full changelog [here](/changelog)\r\n\r\n### Bugs, Issues, Suggestions?\r\nHave an idea of how to make The Homebrewery better? Or did you find something that wasn't quite right? Head [here](https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues/new) and let me know!.\r\n\r\n### Legal Junk\r\nThe Homebrewery is licensed using the [MIT License](https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/blob/master/license). Which means you are free to use The Homebrewery is any way that you want, except for claiming that you made it yourself.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to sell or in some way gain profit for what's created on this site, it's your responsibility to ensure you have the proper licenses/rights for any images or resources used.\r\n\r\n### More Resources\r\nIf you are looking for more 5e Homebrew resources check out [r/UnearthedArcana](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/) and their list of useful resources [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/3uwxx9/resources_open_to_the_community/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src='http://i.imgur.com/hMna6G0.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:50px;right:30px;width:280px' />\r\n\r\n<div class='pageNumber'>1</div>\r\n<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | FANCINESS</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\page\r\n\r\n# Appendix\r\n\r\n### Not quite Markdown\r\nAlthough the Homebrewery uses Markdown, to get all the styling features from the PHB, we had to get a little creative. Some base HTML elements are not used as expected and I've had to include a few new keywords.\r\n\r\n___\r\n* **Horizontal Rules** are generally used to *modify* existing elements into a different style. For example, a horizontal rule before a blockquote will give it the style of a Monster Stat Block instead of a note.\r\n* **New Pages** are controlled by the author. It's impossible for the site to detect when the end of a page is reached, so indicate you'd like to start a new page, use the new page snippet to get the syntax.\r\n* **Code Blocks** are used only to indicate column breaks. Since they don't allow for styling within them, they weren't that useful to use.\r\n* **HTML** can be used to get *just* the right look for your homebrew. I've included some examples in the snippet icons above the editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Images\r\nImages must be hosted online somewhere, like imgur. You use the address to that image to reference it in your brew. Images can be included 'inline' with the text using Markdown-style images. However for background images more control is needed.\r\n\r\nBackground images should be included as HTML-style img tags. Using inline CSS you can precisely position your image where you'd like it to be. I have added both a inflow image snippet and a background image snippet to give you exmaples of how to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Crediting Me\r\nIf you'd like to credit The Homebrewery in your brew, I'd be flattered! Just reference that you made it with The Homebrewery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class='pageNumber'>2</div>\r\n<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | BORING STUFF</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n","changelog":"# changelog\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 22/04/217 - v2.7.4\r\n- Give ability to hide the render warning notification\r\n\r\n\r\n### Friday, 03/03/2017 - v2.7.3\r\n- Increasing the range on the Partial Page Rendering for a quick-fix for it getting out of sync on long brews.\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 18/02/2017 - v2.7.2\r\n- Adding ability to delete a brew from the user page, incase the user creates a brew that makes the edit page unrender-able.

Most issues and errors users are having are because of this feature and it's become too taxing to help and fix these issues.\r\n\r\nAll brews made previous to the release of v3.0.0 will still render normally.\r\n\r\n### Thursday, 19/01/2017 - v2.7.0\r\n- Fixed saving multiple authors and multiple systems on brew metadata (thanks u/PalaNolho re:282)\r\n- Adding in line highlight for new pages\r\n- Added in a simple brew lookup for admin\r\n\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 14/01/2017 - v2.7.0\r\n- Added a new Render Warning overlay. It detects situations where the brew may not be rendering correctly (wrong browser, browser is zoomed in...) and let's the user know\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sunday, 25/12/2016 - v2.7.0\r\n- Switching over to using Vitreum v4\r\n  - Removed gulp, all tasks are run through npm scripts\r\n- Updating docs for local dev\r\n- Removing support for Docker. I have never used it, nor will I ever test for it, so I don't want to continue to explictly support it on this repo. Feel free to make a fork and make it docker-able though :)\r\n- Changed icon for the metadata\r\n- Made links useable in footer (thanks u/Dustfinger1 re:249)\r\n- Added print media queries to remove box shadow on print (thanks u/dmmagic  re: 246)\r\n- Fixed realtime renderer not functioning if loaded with malformed html on load (thanks u/RattiganIV re:247)\r\n- Removed a lot of unused files in shared\r\n- vitreum v4 now lets me use codemirror as a pure node dependacy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 03/12/2016 - v2.6.0\r\n- Added report back to the edit page\r\n- Changed metaeditor icon\r\n- Added a button to quickly share your brew to reddit :)\r\n- Disabled Partial Page Rendering unless your brew hits 75 pages or longer\r\n- The brew renderer will now try and use your first page to judge the page size of each of your brews. This allows you now to set landscape and other weird sizes and everthing should work fine :)\r\n- UI on the user page improved (thanks u/PalaNolho)\r\n- Fixed lists not breaking across columns (thanks u/tyson-nw)\r\n- Added a table of contents snippet (thanks u/tullisar)\r\n- Added a multicolumn snippet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Thursday, 01/12/2016\r\n- Added in a snippet for a split table\r\n- Added an account nav item to new page\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sunday, 27/11/2016 - v2.5.1\r\n- Fixed the column rendering on the new user page. Really should have tested that better\r\n- Added a hover tooltip to fully read the brew description\r\n- Made the brew items take up only 25% allowing you to view more per row.\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, 23/11/2016 - v2.5.0\r\n- Metadata can now be added to brews\r\n- Added a metadata editor onto the edit and new pages\r\n- Moved deleting a brew into the metadata editor\r\n- Added in account middleware\r\n- Can now search for brews by a specific author\r\n- Editing a brew in anyway while logged in will now add you to the list of authors\r\n- Added a new user page to see others published brews, as well as all of your own brews.\r\n- Added a new nav item for accessing your profile and logging in\r\n\r\n\r\n### Monday, 14/11/2016\r\n- Updated snippet bar style\r\n- You can now print from a new page without saving\r\n- Added the ability to use ctrl+p and ctrl+s to print and save respectively.\r\n\r\n### Monday, 07/11/2016\r\n- Added final touches to the html validator and updating the rest of the branch\r\n- If anyone finds issues with the new HTML validator, please let me know. I hope this will bring a more consistent feel to Homebrewery rendering.\r\n\r\n### Friday, 09/09/2016 - v2.4.0\r\n- Adding in a HTML validator that will display warnings whenever you save. This should stop a lot of the issues generated with pages not showing up.\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 20/08/2016 - v2.3.0\r\n- Added in a license file\r\n- Updated the welcome text\r\n- Added in a much better Error page\r\n- If you visit a deleted brew, it will now remove it from your recent list. (Thanks u/sIllverback!)\r\n- Improved parsing of embedded html text in brews. (Thanks u/com-charizard!)\r\n- Added in a new coverpage snippet\r\n- Homebrewery will now try and onsert a good title for your brew if you don't provide one\r\n- Homebrewery now re-renders properly when you zoom\r\n- Fixed the noteblock overlapping into titles (thanks u/dsompura!)\r\n- Fixed a bad search route in the admin panel (thanks u/SnappyTom!)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Friday, 29/07/2016 - v2.2.7\r\n- Adding in descriptive note blocks. (Thanks calculuschild!)\r\n\r\n### Thursday, 07/07/2016 - v2.2.6\r\n- Added a new nav item on the homepage for accessing both recently viewed and edited brews (thanks [ChosenSeraph!](https://github.com/stolksdorf/homebrewery/issues/147))\r\n\r\n### Friday, 10/06/2016 - v2.2.4\r\n- Added an id to each rendered page\r\n- Allows adding in hyperlinks to specific pages\r\n- Even works after you print to pdf!\r\n\r\n### Tuesday, 07/06/2016 - v2.2.2\r\n- Fixed bug with new markdown lexer and aprser not working on print page\r\n\r\n### Sunday, 05/06/2016 - v2.2.1\r\n- Adding in a new Class table div block. The old Class table block used weird stacking of HTML elements, resulting is difficult to control behaviour and poor interactiosn with the rest of the page. This new block is much easier to style and work with.\r\n- Added in a new wide table snippet\r\n- Added in a new auto-incremeting page number snippet (thakns u/Ryrok!)\r\n- Lists in monster stat blocks should be fixed now\r\n\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 04/06/2016 - v2.2.0\r\n- MIgrating The Homebrewery over to hombrewery.naturalcrit.com. It know runs on it's own server, with it's own repo separate from the other tools I'm working on. Makes updating and deploying much easier.\r\n\r\n\\page\r\n\r\n### Sunday, 29/05/2016 - v2.1.0\r\n- Finally added a syntax for doing spell lists. A bit in-depth about why this took so long. Essentially I'm running out of syntax to use in stardard Markdown. There are too many unique elements in the PHB-style to be mapped. I solved this earlier by stacking certain elements together (eg. an `<hr>` before a `blockquote` turns it into moster state block), but those are getting unweildly. I would like to simply wrap these in `div`s with classes, but unfortunately Markdown stops processing when within HTML blocks. To get around this I wrote my own override to the Markdown parser and lexer to process Markdown within a simple div class wrapper. This should open the door for more unique syntaxes in the future. Big step!\r\n- Override Ctrl+P (and cmd+P) to launch to the print page. Many people try to just print either the editing or share page to get a PDF. While this dones;t make much sense, I do get a ton of issues about it. So now if you try to do this, it'll just bring you imediately to the print page. Everybody wins!\r\n- The onboarding flow has also been confusing a few users (Homepage -> new -> save -> edit page). If you edit the Homepage text now, a Call to Action to save your work will pop-up.\r\n- Added a 'Recently Edited' and 'Recently Viewed' nav item to the edit and share page respectively. Each will remember the last 8 items you edited or viewed and when you viewed it. Makes use of the new title attribute of brews to easy navigatation.\r\n- Paragraphs now indent properly after lists (thanks u/slitjen!)\r\n\r\n### Friday, 27/05/2016 - v2.0.6\r\n- Updated the issue template for (hopefully) better reporting\r\n- Added suggestion to use chrome while PDF printing\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, 25/05/2016 -v2.0.5\r\n- The class table generators have the proper ability score improvement progression.\r\n\r\n### Tuesday, 24/05/2016 - v2.0.4\r\n- Fixed extra wide monster stat blocks sometimes only being one column\r\n- The class table generators now follow the proper progression from the PHB (thakns u/IrishBandit)\r\n\r\n### Thursday, 19/05/2016 - v2.0.2\r\n\r\n- No longer server-side pre-render brews, just incase the user entered invalid HTML, it might crahsh the server\r\n- Bumped up the allowed entity size for extra-large brew (Thanks for reporting it dickboner93)\r\n- Added a little error box when a save fails with a custom link to reporting the issue on github.\r\n\r\n\\page\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 14/05/2016 - v2.0.0 (finally!)\r\n\r\nI've been working on v2 for a *very* long time. I want to thank you guys for being paitent.\r\nIt started rather small, but as more and more features were added, I decided to just wait until everything was polished.\r\n\r\nMassive changelog incoming:\r\n\r\n#### Brews\r\n- New flow for creating new brews. Before creating a new brew would immedaitely create a brew in the database and let you edit it. Many people would create a new brew just to experiment and close it, which lead to many \"abandoned brews\" (see the Under the hood section below). This started eating up a ton of database space. You now have to manually save a new brew for the first time, however Homebrewery will store anything you don't have saved in local storage, just in case your browser crashes or whatever, it will load that up when you go back to `/homebrew/new`\r\n- Black blocking edges around notes and stat blocks when printing to PDFs have been fixed\r\n- Borders sometimes not showing up in the second column have been fixed\r\n- All pseudo-element borders have been replaced with reliable border images.\r\n- Chrome can finally print to PDF as good as Chrome Canary! Updating instructions.\r\n- Added a little page number box.\r\n- Added in a new editable Brew Title. This will be shown in the navbar on share pages, and will default to the file name when you save as PDF. All exsisting brews will be defaulted with an empty title.\r\n- Mutliline lists render better now\r\n- Firefox rendering has been slithgly improved. Firefox and Chrome render things **slightly** differently, over the course of a brew, these little changes add up and lead to very noticable rendering differences between the browsers. I'm trying my best to get Firefox rendering better, but it's a difficult problem.\r\n- A bunch of you have wanted to donate to me. I am super flattered by that. I created a [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/stolksdorf). If you feel like helping out, head here :)\r\n\r\n#### Under the Hood Stuff\r\n- Setup a proper staging environment. Will be using this for tests, and hopefully getting the community to help me test future versions\r\n- Server-side prerendering now much faster\r\n- Regular weekly database back-ups. Your brews are safe!\r\n- Database is now uniquely indexed on both editId and shareId, page loads/saving should be much faster\r\n- Improved Admin console. This helps me answer people's questions about issues with their brews\r\n- Added a whole querying/pagniation API that I can use for stats and answering questions\r\n- Clearing out \"Abandoned\" brews (smaller than a tweet and haven't been viewed for a week). These account for nearly a third of all stored brews.\r\n\r\n#### Interface\r\n- Added in a whole new editor with syntax highlighting for markdown\r\n- Built a splitpane! Remembers where you left the split in between sessions\r\n- Re-organized the snippets into a hierarchical groups. Should be much easier to find what you need\r\n- Partial page rendering is working. The Homebrewery will now only load the viewable pages, and any page with `<style>` tags on them. If you are working on a large brew you should notice *significant* performance improvements\r\n- Edit page saving interface has been improved significantly. Auto-saves after 3 seconds on inactivity, now allows user to save at anytime. Will stop the tab from closing witha  pop-up if there are unsaved changes.\r\n- Navbar and overall style has been improved and spacing made more consistent\r\n- Elements under the hood are way more organized and should behaviour much more reliably in many sizes.\r\n- Source now opens to it's own route `/source/:sharedId` instead of just a window. Now easier to share, and won't be blocked by some browsers.\r\n- Print page now auto-opens print dialog. If you want to share your print page link, just remove the `?dialog=true` parameter and it won't open the dialog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\page\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, 20/04/2016\r\n- A lot of admin improvements. Pagninated brew table\r\n- Added a searching and removing abandoned brew api endpoints (turns out about 40% of brews are shorter that a tweet!).\r\n- Fixed the require cache being cleared. Pages should render a bit faster now.\r\n- Pulled in `kkragenbrink`s fix for nested lists, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, 06/04/2016 - v1.4\r\n* Pages will now partially render. This should greatly speed up *very* large homebrews. The Homebreery will figure out which page you should be looking at and render that page, the page before, and the page after.\r\n* Zooming should be fixed. I've changed the font size units to be cm, which match the units of the page. Zooming in and out now look much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Monday, 29/02/2016 - v1.3.1\r\n* Removng the changelog button from the Share page\r\n* Added a A4 page size snippet (thanks \tguppy42!)\r\n* Added support for `<sup>` and `<sub>` tags (thanks crashinworld14!)\r\n\r\n### Saturday, 20/02/2016\r\n* Fixed h1 headers not going full width (thanks McToomin27)\r\n* Added a github issue template\r\n\r\n## v1.3.0\r\n\r\n### Friday, 19/02/2016\r\n* Improved the admin panel\r\n* Added ability to clear away old empty brews\r\n* Added delete button to the edit page\r\n* Added a dynamically updating changelog page! Nifty!\r\n* Added stlying for wide monster stat blocks and single column class tables\r\n* Added snippets for wide monster stat blocks and single column class tables\r\n\r\n### Tuesday, 16/02/2016\r\n* Paragraphs right after tables now indent (thanks LikeAJi6!)\r\n* Added a `@page` css rule to auto turn off margins when printing\r\n* Added a `page-break` property on each `.phb` page to properly page the pages up when exporting (thanks Jokefury!)\r\n* Improved first character rendering on Firefox\r\n* Improved table spacing a bit\r\n* Changed padding at page bottom for better fit and clipping of elements\r\n* Improved spacing for bold text (thanks nickpunt!)\r\n\r\n\r\n## v1.2.0\r\n\r\n### Sunday, 17/01/2016\r\n* Added a printer friendly snippet that injects some CSS to remove backbrounds and images\r\n* Adjusted the styling specific to spell blocks to give it tighter spacing\r\n* Added a changelog! How meta!\r\n\r\n## v1.1.0\r\n\r\n### Thursday, 14/01/2016\r\n* Added view source to see the markdown that made the page\r\n* Added print view\r\n* Fixed API issues that were causing the server to crash\r\n* Increased padding on table cells\r\n* Raw html now shows in view source\r\n\r\n\r\n## v1.0.0 - Release\r\n\r\n### Wednesday, 3/01/2016\r\n\r\n* Added `phb.standalone.css` plus a build system for creating it\r\n* Added page numbers and footer text\r\n* Page accent now flips each page\r\n\r\n","brew":{"version":1,"views":18,"lastViewed":"2017-10-04T14:51:45.902Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-07T05:43:33.560Z","createdAt":"2017-09-28T23:58:43.797Z","published":false,"authors":["Kaskangar"],"systems":[],"tags":"","description":"","text":"Naruto World\n<img \n  src='http://ipt.hillcrest.qld.edu.au/10IPT/fcarlton/Naruto%20World/images/logo.png' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\nVersion 2.0.0.1\n\n#### This pdf was transcribed by:<BR>\nShigeo<BR>\nKaskangar<BR>\n#### With special thanks to\nRose<BR>\nMourdos<BR>\n#### The people who will CLAIM they wrote this are:<BR>\nGreen Rabite<BR>\nRusty<BR>\nShigeo<BR>\n#### With old thanks to<BR>\nAshton<BR>\nFlynn<BR>\nHarlequin<BR>\nJujun<BR>\nXavis<BR>\nGin<BR>\nElegard<BR><BR>\nThis is best viewed in adobe acrobat reader.\n\n\n\\page\n\n<div class='toc'>\n# Table of Contents\n<Br>\n  - [1.1 Table of Contents](#p2)\n    - [1.1.1 1.

Explanation\n------------------------------\n\nThis is a bare-bones walkthrough for character creation. It's best if you're at least partly familiar with the PHB before making your character, but you can get by without that.\n\nThe first step of making a character should be settling on a concept: if you're familiar with the series, you may already know which village or clan you want to be from. If you already have a concept (who your character is, where they're from, what their personality's like, what they're good at) then most of creation should be easy for you.\n\nIf you don't, feel free to just make it up as you go along. You might find inspiration along the way, especially if it's your first time making a character. Don't be afraid to ask for help!\n\nPlease note that when rolling your attributes, you need to find a Roll Watcher (RW), Storyteller (ST), or Gamemaster (GM) can be recorded in the game's roster. You will also need to inform the RW of your chosen clan and Creation Uniques (see below).\n\n\n\n====================\n2. Village and Clan\n------------------------------\n\nFirst, choose which of the three playable Hidden Villages your character is from. This is where your character was trained, who they're loyal to, and ultimately who they work for. The culture between villages does vary, and you may want to read the Village Information nodes, but for the most part it's okay if you don't fit the mold of your home village--ninja are expected to be a little... odd.\n\nEvery village is home to several ninja clans. Clans have special techniques dependent on their bloodline or closely-guarded secrets, which you won't be able to learn otherwise. If you want, you may choose a single clan from your village to be from.\n\nChoosing a clan is not mandatory, and clanless characters receive a 10% XP bonus--something that's discussed in detail in the Advancement chapter--and slightly more skill points.\n\n\n====================\n3. Choose Uniques\n------------------------------\n\nAs a starting character, you have 4 Unique Points (UP) to spend, unless your clan specifies you have less. You may spend these all at creation, or save some (or even all) of them for later use if you prefer. You'll get more UP later, but they're few and far between, and the Creation uniques may only be purchased with your starting UP.\n\n\n====================\n4. Pick Attributes\n------------------------------\n\nThe next step is to determine your five core attributes: Strength (STR), Resilience (RES), Chakra (CHA), Dexterity (DEX), and Agility (AGI).\n\nYou start with 20 in all stats. \n\nAfter that, you have 25 points to distribute among the attributes, with no more than ten in a single stat.\n\n\n====================\n5. Starting Skills\n------------------------------\n\nUnless modified by one of your uniques, you have (total XP)/25 Skill Points (which should come out to 4), which you can spend on any of the game's 10 skills. Now would be a good time to spend them, though don't stress about it too much.\n\nIf you're clanless, you have XP/20 Skill Points instead. That's 5, if you were wondering.\n\n====================\n6. Spend Starting XP\n------------------------------\n\nYou have three options for a character.<Br>\na. 100 XP, but you get a bonus talent at 500xp.<Br>\nb. 1000 XP, but gain the Chuunin rank to begin. <Br>\nc. 1500 XP, Start as a genin.<Br>\n\nAs a starting character you'll probably want to purchase a rank of the Elemental Aptitude ability (in the Chakra category), and the E-rank Ninjutsu techniques Kawarimi, Henge, and Bunshin. These are by no means mandatory, but they're very useful to have. Some ranks in the Money: Requisition ability are also a good idea, if you want to be able to carry equipment with you.\n\nBeyond that, take whatever you think makes the most sense for your character.\n\n\n\n\n\\page\n\n### 1. Primary Attributes\n\n\nAttributes (also commonly referred to as statistics, or 'stats' for short) are numerical representations of your character's overall physical condition: how strong they are, how fast they are, and so forth. They are the baseline for determining performance.\n\nThe five primary attributes make up, in game terms, the core of a character's capabilities.\n\nBaseline 'normal human' stats are around 20. Ninja characters will quickly exceed these numbers. This is a result of them learning to harness the chakra in their body, and benefiting from the symbiotic relationship that chakra has with their body.\n\n#### Strength (STR)\nStrength is a measurement of your ability to exert physical force on the world around you. Exceptionally strong people may be correspondingly muscular, though ninja have developed many training methods which leave them deceptively lean.\n - Your physical damage bonus is STR/15.\n - Your Vitality is (RES multiplies 8 + STR multiplies 4)\n\n#### Resilience (RES)\nThis is your body's ability to endure hardship without suffering from debilitating injuries. Many ninja believe that it's best to avoid being hit entirely... but nobody will say that not being able to take a blow is a good thing.\n - RES/10 is your bonus to Stamina rolls.\n - Your Vitality is (RES multiplies 8 + STR multiplies 4)\n - Your HP is  (RES multiplies 3 + CHA)\n\n#### Chakra (CHA)\nEvery ninja is fueled by chakra, a mystical force that suffuses the world and fills the bodies of all living things, much like 'ki' in certain belief systems. This stat measures both your reserves of raw chakra and your ability to harness them.\n - Your ninjutsu damage bonus is CHA/15.\n - You add CHA/10 to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.\n\n#### Dexterity (DEX)\nRepresenting your deftness, precision, and ability to quickly respond to changes in your environment, dexterity is very important in combat, as it is what enables you to actually hit things that are moving (such as other ninja).\n - Your base Accuracy bonus is DEX/10.\n - Seal Speed of jutsu you perform is reduced by DEX/10.\n\n#### Agility (AGI)\nThe sister attribute to dexterity, agility is how quickly you can react to danger, how fast you can move, and, as the name suggests, how agile you are overall.\n - You add AGI/10 to your Dodge rolls.\n - You add AGI/10 to your Initiative rolls.\n<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>\n\n\n<div style='margin-top:140px'></div>\n\n### 2.Derived Attributes\n\n#### Vitality\nVitality measures your character's ability to shrug off damage, to turn a dangerous blow into a glancing one, and to take a beating without being seriously injured. You have a current and maximum vitality; whenever you take damage, you reduce your current vitality by that amount, though your maximum Vitality is unaffected.\nYour vitality equals your (RES *8 + STR *4).\n\n#### Hit Points (HP)\nHit points are like your 'life force', representing injuries that have significantly harmed you and caused serious damage to your body. After your Vitality reaches 0, you take damage to your Hit Points; an attack which depletes your Vitality has the rest of its damage carry over into your HP.\nYou have (RES *3 + CHA) Hit Points.\n\n####  Damage Bonus, Physical\nAs the name would suggest, this increases the damage you do with physical attacks. Full details on how can be found in the Combat chapter. Your damage bonus is STR/15. Damage bonus is unique in that it is calculated to a single decimal place. For example, with STR of 25, you'd have a damage bonus of 25/15.0 = 1.666 = 1.6\n\n#### Damage Bonus, Ninjutsu\nThis functions identically to physical damage bonus, with two differences. The first, it is determined by your CHA/15; the second, it applies to attacks based on their potency of your chakra rather than your physical strength, which generally means ninjutsu.\n\n####  Willpower\nYour overall strength of will. This is both your raw determination, and your confidence in your body's ability to keep going, and perform at a higher level, even when it, well, can't.\nYour Willpower is calculated as (STR + RES + CHA + DEX + AGI)/100, with a minimum of 1.\n\n\n\\page\n## Uniques \nUniques are one of the many ways in which you can customize your character, giving you effects and capabilities that typically cannot be acquired otherwise. You gain four Unique Points to spend at character creation. Uniques are grouped by cost, with Creation Uniques all costing 1 point each.\n\n### Creation uniques \nUniques which may only be taken when you first make your character, and you may only have two of them. However, you may save your unique points for later, if you want.\n\nAs your character advances in rank, they'll gain more unique points. You can either save these for later, spend them to acquire new uniques, or use them to upgrade existing ones. Regardless, you may only take a single unique once; you cannot, for example, take Endless Energy twice to get double its bonuses.\n\nSome uniques have, below their descriptions, entries such as &quot;Upgrades Into&quot; and &quot;Upgrades From.&quot; To upgrade a unique, you need to pay the difference between the cost of your current unique and the cost of the unique you will be upgrading it to. When you do this, you remove the old unique and replace it with the new one. This does mean that you might lose some effects entirely in the process.\n\n\nFor example, say you had the 1-point Expansive Chakra. You later become a Chuunin, and gain your fifth and sixth unique point. You spend one of them to upgrade your unique to the 2-point Boundless Chakra; you gain the new unique's benefits, but lose Expansive Chakra's cost reduction. Finally, you become a Jounin and use one of the unique points you get then to finish by upgrading Boundless Chakra into either one of its 3-point versions, Regenerative Chakra or Surging Power.\n\n\n###   Analyst\nYou like to study everything you can about people, their actions, their routines, as well as everything around you. This can be distracting at times, but usually it'll give you a good grasp of the situation and your surroundings.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to Awareness, and whenever you take a Rest action you gain 5 AP. You begin combat with 10 AP and if someone uses the same type of attack (Katon, Weapon Taijutsu, etc.) in succession you get a +2 to your defenses. This does not stack.\n\nYou have a -5 penalty to your choice of either Espionage, Stealth, or Survival (your choice). Your observational powers come at a price!\n\n\n###   Berserker\nA beast of a ninja you are, and you act like one too! You get angry easily, and often make rash, terrible decisions out of being bull-headed. At least you're hard to take down when things come to combat (as they often do).\n\nYou add an extra STR*2 to your Vitality, can fight until -25% HP,  and can opt to not take a defensive action in response to an enemy's attack. If their attack Wounds you, you can choose which location it hits (unless the attack is a called shot). Assuming you're still standing, you can then immediately counteract, using any physical attack at your disposal, even though it's not your action. This attack is made at half its normal Speed, cannot have its Speed reduced further, and has a +3 Accuracy bonus.\n\nThis attack must be directed at the person who attacked you. Its base Speed cannot be greater than the base Speed of the attack which provoked it.\n\nWhen you fall below 20% Vitality in combat, you can choose to immediately surrender or keep fighting. If you keep fighting, you won't stop until you're unconscious, or all your opponents have surrendered or been incapacitated\n\n\n###   Competitive\nYou always want to win every race, hit the bull's-eye first, and beat everyone in every game you play. In fights, winning is your everything; that can be good, since losing a fight as a ninja may have fatal consequences.\n\nYou gain 3 bonus XP for winning a sparring match or fight, all your attacks do an extra 5% damage, and you gain a +2 to all d20 rolls. Whenever you miss with an attack, you become increasingly frustrated and driven to land a solid blow on your enemy. This gives you a -1 penalty to all your d20 rolls, but also a +1 bonus to Accuracy, up to a maximum of -5 and +5 respectively (attacks with accuracy rolls use the accuracy bonus, not the d20 roll penalty). These both reset to 0 when you hit someone.\n\n\n\\page\n\n###   Defender\nThrowing solid blocks, you've honed your reflexes and worked your bones and tendons hard so that your twitch reflex is all you need to keep yourself safe.\n\nYou can use the Block defense as a Speed 5 Interrupt. This does have one downside: If you're Stunned when you do this, your Block reduces the incoming attack's damage by 25% less than it normally would. When you don't block, you reduce the damage you take by RES/5 and treat the damage as if it was 20% lower when determining what Wounds you receive. Finally, anyone who makes an unarmed attack against you takes your STR/2 damage, whether or not you block--punching you hurts!\n\nThe focus on self-preservation, however, has left you more cautious than most even when attacking. The damage of all your attacks is considered 10% lower for determining what wounds they cause. This doesn't apply to Jutsu which explicitly increase the damage for wounding purposes.\n\n\n###   Energetic\nRunning, jumping, swimming, fighting; none of it seems to tire you out. Eventually you'll wear down, but not until long after your friends are left staggering around and panting for breath. On the other hand, it's hard to sit still and focus, let alone study, when you're more or less hyperactive.\n\nYou have 6 levels of Fatigue instead of the usual 5, and suffer Fatigue penalties (-1 Accuracy, -2 defenses, and so on) as if you were one Fatigue category lower, while retaining the regular benefits. However, your maximum ranks in all skills are reduced by 3.\n\n###   Genius\nThe term 'genius' has a different meaning to ninja than ordinary people. It's not a measure of intelligence, but rather how easily one can understand the concepts behind ninja techniques. The smartest shinobi alive might not be called a genius, but a Genin using advanced jutsu certainly would. Ninja are just kind of like that.\n\nYour natural talent may allow you to be lazy and smug, or it could motivate you on to further greatness. The cost to learn jutsu is halved! Round up, if necessary. Additionally you get your first three Talents at 750, 2000, and 3750 XP (instead of 1000, 2500, and 4500), and another 1 Talent Point every 1250 XP thereafter (instead of 1500 XP, normally). Finally, you become able to learn D-rank jutsu at 100 XP, C-rank jutsu at 300 XP, B-ranks at 2000, and A-ranks at 4000, without needing to meet any skill or rank requirements.\n\nUnfortunately, you're not without your limitations. This doesn't allow you to ignore other requirements, such as Abilities or Talents. Additionally, it doesn't allow you to ignore requirements specific to individual techniques (such as the Poison Cloud or Telescope Tecniques). Furthermore, reaching beyond your grasp has a cost. Any jutsu you couldn't use without Genius' effects has its damage treated as being 20% lower for the purposes of causing wounds.\n\n```\n```\n\n\n###   Juggernaut\nYou are a solid, hulking brute. You aren't necessarily tall, but you condition yourself hard and have always had a natural gift at receiving pain! Massive, solid forearm muscles and tendons, strong shins, you are a rough opponent to face.\n\nYou reduce all damage you take by RES/4, and treat damage as being 20% less for the purpose of receiving wounds. You ignore the effects of one wound you are suffering from; any time you're wounded you may continue to ignore the current wound, or change to the newly-inflicted one.\n\nAll your movement is reduced by 10%. This applies to your normal movement speed based on AGI, jutsu which allow you to travel (such as Vaulting Leap or Exploding Water Shockwave), and even knockback effects from your enemies.\n\n\n###   Killer\nYou were born to do this. As a ninja, you know all about how the body works. It's a frail bag made of skin, surrounding squishy parts that are easily penetrable. You have either learned the workings of the body, or perhaps you're just a bit more brutal, disregarding the fact that your opponents are living creatures. Whatever way it works out, you are a natural born killer, though sometimes you get a bit caught up in all of it.\n\nYour attacks count as doing 25% more damage for the purposes of wounds, but you may choose to lower the severity of any wounds you inflict by one category. Whenever you roll for the location of a wound you inflict, you may raise or lower the result by DEX/5, after determining what its normal effect would be.\n\nAside from all that, you start with 5 ranks in the Medicine skill, and also have its maximum ranks increased by 4; knowing how to maim people requires knowing at least a bit about how they work.\n\nYou have a -1 penalty to all your defenses.\n\n\\page\n\n\n###   Large\nYour body is muscular, taller, wider, or otherwise... bigger, than other people's. Perhaps you're broad-shouldered and muscular but within the realm of plausibility, or maybe you're a seven foot tall brute; ninja can be downright abnormal.\n\nYou use STR/12, rather than STR/15, to calculate your physical damage bonus, and your physical attacks all have +1 range. In addition to hitting hard, you're tough to take down: you add (STR+RES) to your maximum Vitality, and (RES) to your maximum HP, on top of their normal values. Finally, you have a +3 bonus to Stamina rolls.\n\nAll  attacks that benefit from this unique have their base Speed increased by 2.\n\n\n###   Lucky\nMost things seem to go your way, be it from natural talent or you just happen to pray to the right luck gods! Finding money on the ground or seeing the footprints of an enemy ninja, it all comes to you naturally, and easily, as if you didn't have to work for it at all!\n\nOn any non-combat roll, you roll {2d20.takeHighest(1)} instead of 1d20, and 2+EXP/1000 times per day you can reroll any roll, or allow a (willing) ally to reroll any roll. You can force an enemy to reroll, which takes two of your rerolls, and may only be done to a single person once per battle.\n\nWhen you have no rerolls left, you take a -2 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls.\n\n\n###   Naturalist\nYou are at one with nature! Animals like you more, you understand nature like one of them, and your energy is naturally powerful. You also can forage well, notice slight differences in the environment to follow footprints, or even see the handwork ninja leave with their traps! Perhaps kind because of your attunement, or tempted by your primal urges, you are still a great asset.\n\nYour maximum ranks in Survival are increased by 3, and you gain a +3 bonus to detect, disarm, or avoid any part of a trap. Your ninjutsu damage bonus is CHA/12, rather than CHA/15. You have a +1 bonus to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls per rank of the jutsu you're using (+1 for E-rank, +2 for D-rank, etc.)\n\nHowever, your maximum Research ranks are reduced by 3.\n```\n```\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://i.pinimg.com/736x/81/c3/c0/81c3c01012b439d1b8ad3db506ebb2b4--street-fighter-ex-character-design-references.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\\page\n\n###   Nimble\nYou are very fast, but more importantly you know how to shift your weight to make it easy to bound walls, scamper up to rooftops, weave through tree branches, and jump kick enemies.\n\nYou have +1 Accuracy and a +3 bonus to Stealth and Athletics rolls. You move 20% faster, and on top of that the dodge penalty for not being able to reach the edge of an area-of-effect technique is halved for you. However, if you're ever hit by an AoE attack you take 10% more damage.\n\n\n###   Small\nYou are short, spry, and easily toppled over. The last one's not so good, but your diminutive frame makes it harder for others to keep track of you, while allowing you to squeeze into tight spaces and narrowly dodge attacks. You have a +2 bonus to dodge, and your Dodge interrupt's Speed is changed to 1. If its Speed is somehow raised (such as due to Paralysis) you may still always use it. On the other hand, damage from attacks is considered 10% higher for determining what wounds you receive.\n\n\n\n###   Skilled Shinobi\nWhile you don't excel in combat, you're able to grasp the fundamental skills and concepts important to being a ninja. You have an extra XP/75 Skill Points to spend, and your skill maximums are increased by 2. However, you have a -1 Accuracy penalty.\n\n\n###   Specialist\nYou excel in a particular style of ninja combat, and since noticing that strength you have focused on what you are best at. Be it extraordinary kicks, incredible lightning bolts, or masterful illusions, you are a cut above the rest.\n\nChoose either Taijutsu, Ninjutsu, or Genjutsu. Whichever one you chose has +2 Accuracy, -2 to any necessary Seal Speeds, and a 10% bonus to its damage moves; if Taijutsu, you also have a +2 bonus to Stamina rolls.  Genjutsu gives +3 to all your Genjutsu rolls. Next, choose one of the two that you didn't pick. It has -2 Accuracy (or -2 to all Genjutsu rolls), +3 to any required Seal Speeds, and does 10% less damage; if Taijutsu, you also have a -2 penalty to all Stamina rolls.\n\n\n###   Strong-Willed\nWhen the going gets tough, you keep on going. You have a strong, virtually unbreakable will, and will power through anything standing in your way.\n\nYou have a +2 bonus to your defensive Genjutsu rolls. Once per battle, you can activate this unique as a Speed 0 action. When you do so, you lower your Fatigue by 1 level (though keep your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties). You may also choose one Wound you're suffering from, and ignore all of it's effects. This lasts until the end of combat, at which point the Fatigue and Wounds return.\n\n\n###   Warder\nYou've trained hard to become adept at brushing aside incoming objects that are liable to hurt you! This is useful for shinobi-related activities such as not dying.\n\nYour Parry action becomes a Speed 2 Interrupt, and has a +2 bonus. This also extends to ninjutsu-based defenses reliant upon Accuracy rolls; those jutsu have their base Speed reduced by 2, as well.\n\nAdditionally, you can parry weapons with your bare hands (catching the blade, striking an opponent's arm to knock their blow aside, and so on), or unarmed attacks with a weapon. In the case of parrying unarmed attacks with weapons, however, your normal +2 bonus becomes a -2 instead. (This does not apply to weapons which could parry unarmed attacks without this unique!)\n\nYour reliance on standing your ground while responding to attacks, however, results in a -2 dodge penalty.\n\n\\page\n\n#### 1 Point Uniques\n\n###   Alert\nAs far as ninja are concerned, real ninja, you are their worst nightmare. You can see beyond the unseen, making you a feared weapon. Your max ranks in Awareness are increased by 3 and your ranks in Blind Fighting are considered 1 higher (even above the normal maximum). You have a +3 bonus to Espionage rolls.\n\n\n###   Blur\nIt's hard to tell where you actually are.  Not because they can't see you, but because you never seem to stay still long enough for their eyes to stop trailing you and be able to focus.  You never stop to let inertia win out. When you dodge successfully you may move as many yards as if you'd taken a Speed 3 Move action. When you move towards an enemy as part of an attack, you may move up to that action's full Speed worth, rather than half.\n   Upgrades Into: Exceptionally Fast\n\n\n###   Close Ties\nYour allies are incredibly important to you, each valued as much as a close friend. You form bonds fast, and they can last for life. Your mere presence raises morale! Your allies get a +2 bonus to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, raised to +3 if they're from your village. A single person can only benefit from one ally with Close Ties at a time.\n\nSo long as your allies are with you, you excel in the face of adversity. For every ally present with you in battle you gain a +1 bonus to your own Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, up to a maximum of +3.\n   Upgrades Into: Avenger, Protector\n\n\n###   Elementally Gifted\nWhile most shinobi struggle to learn the basics of elemental control, you took to it like a fish to water (or a bird to wind, or... you know what, this joke is just bad).  Your early aptitude is the first sign of a potential that'll leave even many experienced shinobi envious. You can use an element of your choice as if you had the Elemental Aptitude ability for it, without actually having to use one of your ranks of Elemental Aptitude.\n    Upgrades Into: Elementalist\n\n\n###   Expansive Chakra\nChakra flows readily through your body and into your jutsu, allowing you to effortlessly mold it into techniques. The Chakra costs for all your jutsu are reduced by 1 per rank (1 for E-rank, 2 for D-rank), and you ninjutsu damage bonus is increased by half that amount (0.5 for E-rank, 1 for D-rank, and so forth).\n    Upgrades Into: Boundless Chakra\n\n```\n```\n\n\n###   Full Pockets\nYou were born into money! Or you stole a lot of it, but through some means you happen to be a very rich and resourceful ninja. Be it tools, traps, or weapons, you are always ready for any situation. When you spend XP on money, you get double the normal amount per rank. If you need to make an Espionage roll to bribe someone, it has a +5 bonus. What's more, you may spend Requisition spontaneously, even in the middle of a mission, representing you having just the right thing for the task at hand. Done in combat, this is a Speed 2 action.\n\n\n\n###   Hidden Potential\nYou and your peers both have yet to realize the full extent of your capabilities. Maybe you just haven't found your niche, maybe you're a late bloomer, or maybe something's holding you back. Until you find out what it is, you have +1 Willpower.\n    Upgrades Into: Any 2- or 3-point unique.\n\n\n###   Indefatigable\n(adj) 1. (of a person or their efforts) Persisting tirelessly\nThat's what you are! You have a +1 bonus to Stamina rolls per rank of the jutsu being used (+1 for E-ranks, +2 for D-ranks, etc.); in the case of basic attacks, this becomes a +2 bonus. Additionally, when you Rest your Stamina penalty is lowered by an additional 1 point.\n   Upgrades Into: Endless Energy\n\n\n###   Killing Intent\nYou have what it takes to end a person's life. Even if you personally would choose not to, it's not because you lack the capacity. Something about you gives that away, that killer's instinct having seeped into your very chakra. Whenever you inflict a wound upon someone, roll 1d20+XP/100 against that person's 1d20+XP/100, +1 for every previous wound you've inflicted in battle. If they fail, they receive a Stun with a severity of how much you beat their roll by.\n\n###   Lightfoot\nYou've always been talented at sneaking and hiding in almost any and all places. Whether a dark shadow or henge'd as a tissue box in a room, you know how make your presence scarce.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to Stealth rolls, and the speed of your Hide action is reduced by 3. You can move when in Stealth 2 without lowering the level of your stealth.\n    Upgrades Into: Skirmisher\n\n\\page\n\n###   Martial Prowess\nYou're adept at turning a fight into a one-man training montage with your enemy being a rag doll disoriented by every blow.  You have no need for weapons:  You are the weapon.\n\nYour Combos are not broken from attacking a new target, or from taking damage from an attack made by someone other than your initial target.  You gain a +3 bonus to Counter Combo opposed rolls, and your Combos inflict a (Combo Counter -2) Stun, which is doubled when using a Finisher. Additionally, your combos are not broken by a Stun of a severity less than (Combo Counter +2).\n    Upgrades Into: Bruiser\n\n\n###   Nimble Hands\nYou have always been able to pick things up, spin them between your fingers, throw things just right, and otherwise use your hands well. You may throw up to DEX/8 weapons with a multi-throw, reduce Seal Speeds  and the Speed of ranged attacks by 2, and may draw weapons without any sort of action. You may sheathe weapons as a Speed 0 action.\n   Upgrades Into: Ranged Specialist, Single-Handed Seals\n\n###   Restrained\nYou know just how much force you're applying, and how to, when necessary, apply less. This is good when doing handiwork, but also when fighting someone who you don't want to kill or maim.\n\nAny time you inflict damage, after determining what the wound would be you may activate this unique. The attack's damage is reduced by 25%, and the wound it inflicted (based on its original damage) is reduced by one category. When you use this to lower the severity of a wound you get a +1 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls for the rest of the battle, to a maximum of +5.\n\nPreventing a wound this way will not stop it from ending any Genjutsu the victim was suffering from.\n\nWhen an attack you make would prove lethal, you may instead hold back at the last moment. This leaves your victim at 0 HP (or, if they were below 0 HP, they aren't reduced any further), raises the severity of any wounds you inflicted by 1 (and cannot be combined with a normal activation of this unique), but prevents your attack from being fatal.\n    Upgrades Into: Avenger, Protector\n\n\n###   Seal Master\nYou're really, really good with handseals. You make them fast, and mold your chakra just as rapidly. It could be natural talent... but, honestly, you know what it probably was? Probably when you were a kid you were incredibly obsessed with being a super-cool ninja, so you spent all your free time making fake handseals and pretending to shoot fireballs at your friends. Anyway, you reduce Seal Speeds by Dex/8 (instead of Dex/10), and any jutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has a 10% bonus to its damage.\n   Upgrades Into: Jutsu Master, Single-Handed Seals\n\n```\n```\n\n\n###   Weapon Master\nYou know your weapons.  You know how to use them, and how to change them to suit your style. Your Weapon Focus ability applies to all weapons, only needing to be taken once, and it only increases Stamina costs by 2 per rank. Additionally, that ability's limit is changed to (DEX -30)/20, maximum 4. If you take this after creation, you may refund your extra Weapon Focus\n    Upgrades Into: Ranged Specialist\n\n\n###   Weight Trainer\nYou strap yourself down with weights--either from tailoring your clothes that way, or from strapping weights to your limbs--and hamper yourself constantly. All in the name of one. Perfect. Fight.\n\nOnce per two months you can remove the weights as Speed 10 to have your STR, DEX, and AGI improve to 120% of their regular values, for that fight only. These attribute adjustments do not raise your Vitality or HP.\n\nDue to your hard training your maximum and current Athletics ranks are increased by 2.\n\n\\page\n\n##### 2 Point Uniques\n\n###   Applied Knowledge\nWhere others use talent, you rely on practical application of your (probably vast) knowledge to guide you. It's all well and good for someone to be able to spot the vague outline of a hidden opponent; you, on the other hand, notice the way the bush they're hiding behind has been shifted, as that plant only grows facing west.\n\nYou're probably kind of a nerd, to be honest. You add one third of your Research skill rank as a bonus to all your non-Research skill rolls. Ranks in all your skills other than Research are considered to be (Research ranks)/4 higher for the purpose of learning Abilities.\n\n\n###   Avenger\nSomeone wronged you, or someone you cared about, in a way which you cannot forgive. You have an unremitting hatred for them, and you channel an unhealthy amount of your free time, thoughts, and energy into finding them and doing whatever you can to make them suffer.\n\nWhen you take this unique, choose the group it applies to, up to the size of a hidden village. You get +2 to Accuracy and d20 rolls against that group. If the group is only the size of a single clan, the bonuses raises to +3. Against a group of 10 or fewer individuals (who can still be grouped together under a single category, not just ten different people named off individually), it becomes +5. And, against a single person, you have +5 Accuracy and d20 rolls, with an additional +1 for every thousand exp they are above you. You can choose to go into UP-debt to take this unique, though this requires GM approval.\n\nIndependent of all the above, you also receive the benefits of the 1-point unique Killing Intent--you've been driven to darkness, and it shows in more than just your desire for vengeance.\n    Upgrades From: Any 1-Point Unique\n\n\n###   Boundless Chakra\nYou have near-limitless reserves of chakra. Things that should tire people out simply don't have that effect on you. You have a +3 bonus to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and whenever you acquire a Chakra Exhaustion penalty from using a jutsu, that penalty is reduced by 1. Whenever you rest, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is lowered by the same amount as your Stamina penalty. The Upkeeps of all your jutsu are reduced by 1.\n    Upgrades From: Expansive Chakra\n    Upgrades Into: Regenerative Chakra\n\n\n###   Bruiser\nYou hit harder than you have any business doing. You may not be bulky and muscular, but you know how to use your weight and momentum. You add RES/40 to your physical damage bonus (to one decimal point, as usual), and STR/20 to all grapple rolls. You reduce any damage you take by STR/10. \n\nYour Combos are not broken from attacking a new target, or from taking damage from an attack made by someone other than your initial target.  You gain a +3 bonus to Counter Combo opposed rolls, and your Combos inflict a (Combo Counter -2) Stun, which is doubled when using a Finisher. Additionally, your combos are not broken by a Stun of a severity less than (Combo Counter +2).\n\nYou cannot have this unique as well as Martial Prowess.\n    Upgrades From: Martial Prowess\n\n\n###   Chakra Sensitive\nYou have an almost subconscious ability to detect disturbances in the For--chakra. Disturbances in chakra. It's not particularly refined, and it may never be, but it's still a valuable talent among shinobi.\n\nYour sense range is CHA*2. Any time someone within your sense range advances a Fatigue level due to failing a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you know their location and current (after the roll) Fatigue level. If they were hiding from you, this means you now know their location.\n\nIn combat, this may be used any time someone makes a Chakra Exhaustion roll, even if they succeed. In this case, roll your Chakra Control against theirs; if you succeed, you know their location.\n    Upgrades Into: Chakra Sensor\n\n\n###   Determined\nYou are actually good at something--you just haven't figured out what yet. Some day you'll figure out where your natural talent lies, or everything will just suddenly 'click' for you, and you'll go from underdog to legendary ninja in the making, proving to everyone how great you are.\n\nThat's what you keep telling yourself, anyway. It gets a little bit harder to believe that every day, but you didn't get where you are by giving up just because you're no good at whatever it is you keep failing to do. Whenever your Fatigue level increases from failing a CE or Stamina roll, you gain 1 temporary Willpower, which is lost (if you haven't spent it yet) the next time your Fatigue increases.\n    Upgrades From: Hidden Potential\n    Upgrades Into: Any 3-point unique.\n\n\n###   Elementalist\nMost shinobi have a difficult time mastering the usage of elemental chakra. You do not. It comes naturally to you, and even exceeds the limits of most people's physical capabilities. You are able to use two elements of your choice as if you had the Elemental Aptitude ability for them, though this does not actually count as ranks in that ability.\n    Upgrades From: Elementally Gifted\n    Upgrades Into: Elemental Mastery\n\n\n###   Endless Energy\nYou don't get tired. It's just not something you do. Whenever your Stamina penalty increases, it increases by 1 less. The first time in a battle you fail a Stamina roll, you advance one less Fatigue category. You enjoy a +(RES)/40 bonus to all your Stamina rolls. Every 15 IC, your Stamina penalty decreases by 1.\n   Upgrades From: Indefatigable\n\n\\page\n\n###   Exceptionally Fast\nYou take speed to a new level. You outrun the wind, your allies, and yes, even the bear chasing you. Everything you do is almost too fast for the eye to follow. The base Speed of all your actions is reduced by 10%; this reduction is actually rounded up, meaning that a Speed 11 technique would be reduced by (11*0.1 = 1.1 -&gt; 2) 2, to Speed 9. Even so, it cannot be used to reduce an action to Speed 0. As long as you partially succeed in a Dodge, you take no secondary effects from the attack (such as status conditions, penalties, or wounds) and when you dodge successfully you may move as many yards as if you'd taken a Speed 5 Move action. When you move towards an enemy as part of an attack, you may move up to that action's full Speed worth, rather than half.\n\nYou cannot have this unique as well as Blur.\n   Upgrades From: Blur\n\n\n###   Jutsu Master\nYou have a knack for mastering new jutsu, and, more impressively, not confusing them with one another no matter how many you seem to learn. The cost to learn non-clan jutsu is halved, before any other reductions. This is, in fact, retroactive! You reduce Seal Speeds by Dex/8 (instead of Dex/10), do 5% more damage with all your jutsu (not just ninjutsu), and any ninjutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has an additional 5% damage.\n\nYou cannot have this unique as well as Seal Master.\n   Upgrades From: Seal Master\n\n\n###   Protector\nYour friends are your life and you will make sure no harm comes to them. Becoming either a wall in between them and your enemies, or an unstoppable force that ravages the oncomers, you will always do your best to get everyone else out safely. You add your RES one more time to your Vitality and HP.\n\nYou have a secondary pool of Vitality, equal to half your normal maximum, that cannot be wounded and is damaged only when Taking the Hit for someone else.\n\nYour Take the Hit action has a +5 bonus, and when you successfully take the hit you may automatically block. It automatically succeeds under any of the following conditions: you and your allies are outnumbered; the total XP of you and your allies is less than 75% the total XP of your enemies; you are protecting someone who has run out of Vitality; you are protecting someone of lower rank; or you are protecting somebody with 75% or less of your total XP.\n    Upgrades From: Close Ties, Restrained\n\n\n###   Ranged Specialist\nYou prefer to keep your distance in combat, without resorting to powerful ninjutsu. Rather, you favor the basics: projectile weaponry! You may throw up to DEX/8 weapons with a multi-throw, reduce Seal Speeds and the Speed of ranged attacks by 4, and may draw weapons without any sort of action. You may sheathe weapons as a Speed 0 action.\n\nAs a Speed 4 Interrupt you may perform a ranged parry with a +4 bonus against any thrown weapon attack (including those caused or improved by jutsu). The exact weapons used don't matter, but you must throw as many weapons in this parry as your opponent did in their attack. \n\nYou cannot have this unique as well as Nimble Hands.\n    Upgrades From: Nimble Hands\n\n\n###   Single-Handed Seals\nBe it rigorous training or just excess talent, you've mastered one of the most exceptionally rare talents among shinobi: being able to perform handseals with only a single hand. You reduce Seal Speeds by Dex/7 (instead of Dex/10), and any jutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has a 10% bonus to its damage. Your maximum and current Chakra Control ranks are increased by 2, and you reduce the Seal Speed of any ninjutsu by an additional Chakra Control/10 while using both hands.\n\nYou cannot have this unique as well as Seal Master.\n   Upgrades From: Seal Master\n\n\n###   Skirmisher\nYou prefer a very specific style of fighting: engage your opponent, seize the advantage while they're confused, then fall back and disengage. While they're trying to recover, prepare yourself to repeat that again, and do so until your enemies are too demoralized or badly beaten to fight back. You have a +3 bonus to Stealth rolls, and the speed of your Hide action is reduced by 3. You can move when in Stealth 2 without lowering the level of your stealth and when making attacks while in Stealth 2 your damage bonus is increased by DEX/30, or DEX/20 if you break stealth to do so. Your limit for Stealth skill ranks is increased by 3, and you can hide so long as your opponents have a visibility penalty of -4 or worse.\n\nYou cannot have this unique as well as Lightfoot.\n    Upgrades From: Lightfoot\n\n\n###   Tenacious\nYou have learned to delve into the minds of your opponents, figured out the way they tick, and keep a constant control over their mind. Keeping enemies mesmerized is a simple feat for you. You have a +3 bonus to Genjutsu rolls, your maximum and current Research ranks are increased by 2, and -3 to the Speed of all your genjutsu. Opponents must successfully use Genjutsu Kai twice to break free from your illusions; they do realize this after the first success. Skill focus's scale is now once every third rank (Ranks 1, 2, and 3 cost 2 SP; ranks 4, 5, and 6 cost 3 SP; and so forth).\n\n\n\\page\n\n##### 3 Point Uniques\n\n###   Chakra Sensor\nYou possess the coveted ability to sense the chakra in living things. Unlike being merely sensitive to chakra, you can tell people apart by their chakra alone.\n\nYour sense range is CHA*5. Whenever someone within your sense range advances a Fatigue level due to failing a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you know their location and can identify their chakra signature, as well as their current Fatigue level. In combat, this effect takes places whenever they make a Chakra Exhaustion roll.\n\nYou can also tell any general traits of their chakra (&quot;oppressive&quot;, &quot;weak&quot;, etc.), if they're fallen into HP, and what their Elemental Affinity is (only if they have ranks in the ability). If you detect somebody who's in Stealth, you know their location (i.e. they are no longer hidden from you, just as if you'd found them normally). Your maximum Chakra Control ranks are increased by 3 and you have a +3 bonus to your defensive Genjutsu rolls.\n\nYou can also use the following action:\n\nScan (Speed 10)\nIn combat, make an opposed Chakra Control roll against anyone (or everyone) present; people may allow themselves to fail this roll rather than bothering with it. People being scanned have a penalty to their Chakra Control roll equal to the total Upkeep penalty of any jutsu they're maintaining. If you succeed, you detect them as described above. Out of combat, if someone passes a roll against your Scan they will automatically pass all other rolls against it made within the next half hour.\n    Upgrades From: Chakra Sensitive\n\n\n###   Elemental Mastery\nYou have peerless control over elemental chakra, far beyond the realm of what's considered normal, and to a level that some would even think is impossible. Choose two elements; you can use them as if you had taken the Elemental Aptitude ability for them. Additionally, your ranks in the Elemental Affinity ability apply to all elements you can use. This doesn't mean your personal chakra nature corresponds to all five elements, only that you're equally skilled with them all.\n\nEach rank of Elemental Affinity also gives you a +0.5 bonus to your ninjutsu damage bonus with elemental ninjutsu. Additionally, all your offensive elemental ninjutsu receive a bonus depending upon what element your last offensive elemental ninjutsu technique was, and what rank it was. This only works if the jutsu you are using is of a different element than the previous one (using two Raiton in a row will provide no bonus; if you then switch to a Katon, that Katon would receive the Lightning bonus listed below).\n\nEarth: Stun of 2 * (rank)\nFire: Burns of 2* (rank)\nLightning: Paralysis of 1 per rank above E (1 for D, 2 for C, etc.), for 5 * (severity + 1) IC.\nWater: -2 Chakra cost per rank\nWind: Blocking's effect is reduced by 5% per rank.\n    Upgrades From: Elementalist\n\n```\n```\n\n\n###   Regenerative Chakra\nYou have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of chakra. You might push yourself to your limit, but within minutes your chakra reserves will have replenished themselves. During combat in particular, it's noticeable that your energy seems to have no limit.\n\nYou have a +5 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls. Whenever you spend a point of Willpower, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is reset to 0; you can also choose to spend a point of Willpower specifically for this purpose immediately before making a Chakra Exhaustion roll.\n\nWhen using one or more techniques with an Upkeep, the total Upkeep is reduced by 1+CHA/30, to a minimum of half its normal value. Additionally, once per battle you may fail a Chakra Exhaustion check and advance one less Fatigue level (though your penalties do not reset).\n\nYou have (your max Willpower) chakra points each battle. You may spend these to improve the result of a Chakra Exhaustion roll on a 1:1 basis after seeing the result. As you are worn down progressively, your body tries to compensate by producing even more chakra. As a result, your ninjutsu damage bonus is increased by your Fatigue level.\n    Upgrades From: Boundless Chakra\n\n\n###   Relentless\nYou don't stop, you don't quit, and you absolutely don't give up. Those would be great, admirable traits, except for you it only really applies when it comes to brutalizing other human beings.\n\nEvery time you hit someone with a taijutsu attack, you get a +1 bonus to your physical damage bonus, up to a maximum of half its normal value. This bonus resets when you miss, change targets, or use a non-taijutsu attack. Hyuuga using Jyuuken instead receive this bonus to their ninjutsu damage bonus. All your unarmed attacks gain Stun 2, or increase their existing Stun by 1.\n\nWhen you miss within any taijutsu attack your next action comes sooner, as if the Speed of the action you used was half its actual value. For example, if you missed with a Speed 13 action on IC 30, your next action would come on IC 37, rather than IC 43. Every time you miss, your next action gets a cumulative +1 Accuracy as long as it's a taijutsu attack, to a maximum of +3; hitting someone, or taking a different kind of action, resets this bonus.\n    Upgrades From: Bruiser\n\n\\page\n\n###   Super Novice\nYou're still not good at anything in particular. Everything for you is two steps forwards and one step back. Even if you thought you found your niche, it turns out that no, you really didn't. But you're tired of letting that get in your way! Now, you're going to just do what you want, your way! Yeah! That'll show 'em!\n\nYou have a 10% XP bonus. When you're Wounded, you get a temporary 1 point of Willpower. This lasts until the next time you're Wounded; if you haven't spent it by then, it's replaced. If you have, you get a new one.\n    Upgrades From: Any 1- or 2-point unique, except Elementally Gifted or Elementalist\n\n\n###   Surging Power\nYou have a dauntless ability to keep fighting, no matter what the situation. Even when you should be sprawled in the dirt unable to move a single muscle, somehow you stand back up and keep fighting.\n\nYou can spend Willpower to reroll your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls (with all the normal rules, and benefits, for spending Willpower on a roll). Additionally, you can spend a point of Willpower to ignore all effects of a single woudn you're suffering from for the remainder of the battle.\n\nFinally, you reduce the penalties to Accuracy and defensive rolls by your current Willpower. So, at 3 Fatigue with 4 Willpower remaining you would go from -3 Accuracy and -6 defensive rolls to no Accuracy penalty and -2 defensive rolls.\n    Upgrades From: Boundless Chakra, Endless Energy\n\n\n###   Tactician\nBeyond raw strength or the biggest fireballs, you focus on a different aspect of combat: strategy. Through clever decoys, exploiting weaknesses, and striking at blindspots, you can take down superior foes.\n\nThe first time you use any action in combat, it gains +2 Accuracy or to its relevant d20 roll (such as a dodge). If you hit with an attack that receives that bonus, you immediately gain (that action's Speed)/2 AP (though this won't take you over your maximum).\n\nYou may spend 10 AP to replace an action's Accuracy (or convert its existing accuracy roll) into an accuracy roll using 2d20.takeHighest(1) in place of 1d20.\n\nYou can shout advice or instructions, or just pointers about your enemies and the battlefield, to allies, to give them an edge. As a Speed 0 action, you can switch your current place in the initiative order with a willing ally's, allowing them to act immediately and delaying your next action to the previous location of theirs. This costs 2 AP per IC away their action is, and may not be used on a stunned ally. You may spend 1 Willpower to lower the cost to 1 AP per IC for one use.\n\n\n\\page \n\n\n#   Combat\nCombat... happens. Realistically, it's something ninja know how to do, and as they get more experience it becomes something they're able to do very well. Accordingly, there are rules for combat, which you use when trying to beat other people into submission, or prevent them from doing the same to you.\n\nThe combat chapter has 7 sections of varying importance, which are...!\n\n\n## &lt; Initiative &gt;\nA brief explanation of the core of Naruto World's combat system. It explains the broad concepts of how time, turn order, and actions are handled. A short but important read! Pretty much nothing else in the chapter will make sense without this.\n\n## &lt; Actions &gt;\nComing in right behind 'Initiative' in terms of importance, here is where you'll find all the basic actions which everyone can perform, along with rules on how to attack and your bread-and-butter defenses. Other attractions include a crash course in how to use ninjutsu and genjutsu, and rules for spending Willpower (you remember Willpower, right? one of your derived Attributes?).\n\n## &lt; Stealth &gt;\nHow to hide, how to find people who are hiding, and what you can do while hidden. You should probably be at least familiar with this before you start playing, but you can safely ignore it your first time through the chapter.\n\n## &lt; Status and Conditions &gt;\nYou may want to skim this section, but it's not vital. You should have read the Conditions part at least once before you get into combat, and you can basically ignore Statuses until they actually come up during battle; same for effects.\n\n## &lt; Fatigue &gt;\nThis is important; Fatigue is one of the key elements of combat, as it's what regulates how frequently you can use your powerful jutsu before being worn out. You should probably read it right after Initiative, or perhaps Actions. Definitely more important than Stealth or Status/Conditions.\n\n## &lt; Wounds &gt;\nYou should read the Explanation node before you get into combat. The rest you can safely ignore until you actually have to deal with the effects, either due to inflicting them on others, or suffering from them yourself.\n\n## &lt; Recovery &gt;\nWhile it wouldn't hurt to at least peruse the node (though the 'Guidelines' section can be ignored unless those topics actually come up), you can basically ignore this entirely until the aftermath of your first battle.</text>\n\n\\page \n\n#  Initiative\n >1. Initiative Roll\n >2. Flow of Time\n >3. Simultaneous Actions\n >4. Action Points\n >5. Example\n\n====================\n1. Initiative Roll\n------------------------------\n\nCombat begins with all participants making an Initiative roll: 1d20+(AGI)/10. From there, everyone is assigned a number depending upon how well they did compared to one another.\n\nEveryone subtracts their roll from the person who rolled the highest; this is the initiative count they will act on.\n\nFor example, Choji, Shikamaru, and Ino are all preparing to fight, and so they roll initiative. Choji scores an 6, Shikamaru a 16, and Ino a 12. They will act on the following initiative counts:\nChoji: 16 - 6 = 10\nShikamaru: 16 - 16 = 0\nIno: 16 - 12 = 4\n\n\n====================\n2. Flow of Time\n------------------------------\n\nCombat begins on Initiative Count 0, or &quot;Init 0&quot;, or simply &quot;IC 0&quot;. Players act whenever their initiative count is reached.\n\nEvery action a player can take has a given Speed associated with it. When they take an action, its effects are resolved immediately, and its speed is added to their current initiative count; that is when they will be able to act again.\n\nFor example, if you use a Speed 6 action on IC 5, your action will be resolved then and there. After it finishes, combat will progress to IC 6, other people will take their turns, and so on, until IC (5+6 =) 11 is reached, when you will be able to act again.\n\n\nSome effects may lower an action's speed. No matter how many such effects are applied, no action's speed may ever go below half its original value, rounded up, and no action's Speed can be reduced below 3. This does mean that an action with a base Speed of 3 or lower may not have its Speed decreased at all.\n\n\n====================\n3. Simultaneous Actions\n------------------------------\n\nIf two people act on the same initiative count, both of their actions are declared and resolved simultaneously. Thus, you and your opponent will both fully declare and resolve your attacks (you can take turns doing so, for the sake of convenience), but not apply their effects until after you've both done so, at the very end of the IC.\n\nBlocking is a partial exception. If you were blocking when your turn came up, and you choose to block against, it takes priority; that is to say, you may use Block as a defense against an attack delivered on the same IC, under those circumstances.\n\n\n====================\n4. Action Points\n------------------------------\n\nOne of the things that makes battles dramatic is one or both sides pulling out sudden, unpredicted surprises, and among shinobi that's par for the course. Mechanically, this is represented by &quot;Action Points&quot;; thematically this can be a burst of adrenaline, or the result of you carefully luring your opponent into just the right position for you to counter-attack.\n\nYou gain 5 AP every time the Initiative Count reaches a multiple of 20. You start the battle with zero, and can have up to a maximum of AGI/2.\n\nYou can spend AP whenever you take an action. Each AP spent reduces the action's Speed by 1.\n\n====================\n5. Example\n------------------------------\n\nIt may help if you read the Actions section of this chapter before reading this example.\n\nUsing the example above, we had Shikamaru acting on IC 0, Ino on 4, and Choji on 10. Shikamaru spends his first action attacking Choji with a Speed 8 punch, meaning he'll act next on IC 8.\n\nTo defend himself, Choji tries to dodge, though fails to do so. He's hit, and takes damage, but dodging pushed his next action back by 2, putting his next action on 12.\n\n\nIno goes next, and begins forming handseals for a potent ninjutsu technique. It has a Seal Speed of 14, meaning she'll be ready to act on IC (4 + 14 =) 18.\n\n\nShikamaru goes again, and uses a simple taijutsu technique with a speed of 12. Choji tries to dodge again, this time evading successfully. Shikamaru's next action will be on IC 20 (8+12), and Choji's on IC 14 (12+2, because he dodged).\n\n\nChoji's taking a bit of a beating, but Shikamaru's not hitting hard. He's worried about what Ino might be planning, though (she only had to declare that she was using a Perform Handseals action, not what jutsu it was for), so he disengages and rushes his other teammate, unleashing a powerful taijutsu technique with a speed of 20. Not wanting to take that kind of hit, Ino tries to dodge, and fails.\n\nIno has to make a Chakra Control skill check, against the damage of Choji's attack divided by 10. She rolls very well, and manages to succeed; had she failed, she would've automatically aborted her handseals action, meaning her next action would be on IC 15 (the attack happened on IC 14, +1 = 15), and if she wanted to use that technique she'd need to start over.\n\n\\page \n\nChoji's next action won't come until IC 34 (14+20), whereas Ino's jutsu has been delayed until IC 20 (18+2).\n\n\nIC 20 comes up, and Shikamaru and Ino are both ready to go. It's too late for Shikamaru to do anything about Ino's jutsu; she's already completed the handseals, and this turn she'll be able to use it. Worse yet, he doesn't know if she'll be targeting him or Choji.\n\nIf he'd had a little more time--for example, if he'd used a quicker move in place of the taijutsu technique he utilized last--he could declare a Block of a speed that would expire some time after Ino's action, allowing him to reliably defend himself if she chose to target him.\n\nThat's not an option, so he goes for a quick punch at her (not wanting to make the same mistake as last time, that'll give him plenty of opportunity to prepare before Choji's next action). Ino uses her technique, a Speed 6 ninjutsu. Both try to dodge the other's technique.\n\nThis means that Shikamaru will act on IC (20+8+2) 30, Ino on (20+6+2) 28, and Choji on 34.</text>\n\\page \n#   Actions\n  >1. Basic Actions\n######   a.

Basic Actions\n------------------------------\n\nThese are actions that anyone can do in combat, and the rules associated with them.\n\n###     a.  Basic Attack, Unarmed (Speed 8, Stamina 5)\nThe simplest form of attack, this is a catch all for punches, kicks, headbutts, and any other attack which uses your body to cause harm to your enemy's. This deals 2d4 damage.\n\n\n###     b.  Basic Attack, Weapon (Speed Variable)\nThis is any ordinary attack with a weapon, from throwing shuriken to swinging oversized swords. The speed is listed with the individual weapon, as is the base damage.\n\n\n###     c.  Block (Speed Variable)\nAs an action, you may declare that you are blocking, and state a Speed for the action. Until your next action, you may use the Block defense (see 'Defending' below) against any incoming attacks.\n\n\n###     d.  Rest (Speed 5)\nResting is pausing to cool down and gather your breath. Since it doesn't directly lead to incapacitating your enemy, most ninja prefer to do this out of battle; however, sometimes pacing yourself is the only way to achieve victory. Every Rest action you take reduces your Stamina penalty (see the 'Fatigue' portion of this chapter) by 1, to a minimum of 0.\n\nYou cannot reduce the speed of your Rest action; 'resting as fast as you can' is, after all, something of an oxymoron.\n\n\n###     e.  Perform Handseals (Speed Variable, Abort)\nMost ninjutsu and genjutsu technique require the use of handseals, specialized hand signs that direct and mold the flow of chakra. Representing this, those jutsu have a Seal Speed listed in their description. That number, minus your DEX/10, gives you the modified seal speed, which is the Speed of your Perform Handseals action. However, other Speed-reducing effects do not apply to Perform Handseals. A Seal Speed of 0 means that while handseals are required, you can perform them so fast that the time required is negligible.\n\nPerform Handseals actions are necessary to perform most Ninjutsu and Genjutsu (see below). You may forego part, or all, of your DEX/10 reduction of Seal Speed if you wish (for example, with 40 DEX you could use Perform Handseals action for a seal speed 10 jutsu at anywhere between Speed 6 and Speed 10, as you pleased).\n\nHandseals require the use of both hands, and if they're interrupted for any reason you have to start over again. Although you don't have to declare what technique you're performing the handseals for when you start, all techniques have their own, unique combination of seals to perform them; this means that if you changed your mind partway through a Perform Handseals action, you'd need to start a new one.\n\n\n###     f.  Move (Speed Variable)\nFor the most part, ninja can move faster than ordinary people. When you actually devote time to moving in battle, you travel (AGI)*(number of IC spent moving)/50 yards.\n\nSometimes you may need to close the distance and attack an opponent all at once. When attacking, you may move towards your opponent a distance corresponding to half your attack's Speed, for free. Thus, if you needed to rush an enemy and throw a punch at them, and had 25 AGI, as a Speed 8 action you could move up to (25*(8/2)/50 =) 2 yards and then use a basic unarmed attack.\n\nMovement is unique, in that you cannot use Action Points to reduce its Speed. Your distance traveled is determined by the actual number of IC spent on movement.\n\n\\page \n\n###     g.  Interrupt (Speed N/A)\nBeing able to interrupt is a special quality certain abilities and techniques have, which allows them to be performed in response to another action, generally an attack directed at the user; for example, most defensive jutsu have this quality.\n\nYou may use an interrupt if the Speed of the interrupt (and in the case of ninjutsu, Speed + modified Seal Speed) is half or less that of the action you're interrupting. This is one instance where you may use a ninjutsu with handseals without having performed the handseals as a prior action. The Speed (not, in the case of ninjutsu, counting Seal Speed) of the interrupt is added to your next action on the IC.\n\nActions used as Interrupts with base Speeds of 3 or below may still be reduced to half (rounded up) of their base speed (normally, an action with a base Speed of 3 or lower cannot have its Speed reduced further).\n\n====================\n2. Ninjutsu and Genjutsu\n------------------------------\n\n###     a.  Performing\nThe majority of ninjutsu and genjutsu techniques have an entry for Seal Speed in their description. Those that don't, and those with a Seal Speed of 0, can be used at will, like regular actions.\n\nFor the rest, however, they may not be used unless preceded by a Perform Handseals action (see above). The jutsu you're using must be used on your next action, at which point its effects are resolved and you, as normal, will determine your next action based on the jutsu's speed.\n\nIf you take damage while forming handseals (between the declaration of your Perform Handseals action and when you actually use the jutsu), you must exceed 10 + (damage dealt / 10) on a Chakra Control skill roll in order to continue. Failure means you automatically Abort your Perform Handseals action.\n\n\n###     b.  Genjutsu\nGenjutsu are the mind-affecting, often-illusionary techniques used by ninja. While they can be potent in some situations, they're difficult to use against experienced ninja. Attempting to influence someone with Genjutsu (whether directly, such as a mental attack, or indirectly, casting an illusion over an area and determining if it fools them) is resolved through a set of opposed Genjutsu rolls.\n\nThe 'attacker' rolls 1d20+XP/400, and the 'defender' rolls 1d20+XP/200, both adding any bonuses to genjutsu. Some bonuses may apply only to offensive or defensive genjutsu rolls. In these cases, the person using the genjutsu is the 'attacker', and the person trying to avoid being affected is the 'defender'. If the defender rolls lower than their opponent, they suffer the effects of the technique being used.\n\n\n====================\n3. Attacking\n------------------------------\n\nThe simplest and most effective way to resolve a conflict is often violence. In some cases, it's the only way. Thus, it behooves any shinobi to be able to, when necessary, incapacitate or kill an opponent.\n\nThe first step of attacking is to declare what your attack will be, its speed, and its accuracy, so that the other player knows what defenses they can use against it.\n\n\n###     a.  Accuracy\nAccuracy is a measurement of how precise your attacks are, represented by a target number (TN) your opponent has to match or beat on their defense roll. Your attack's Accuracy is 10+(DEX)/10, plus any bonuses you may get from abilities, uniques, or the technique you're using.\n\nAfter you've declared your attack, your opponent will declare and (if applicable) roll their defense. If you hit them successfully, you'll then roll damage.\n\n\n###     b. Accuracy Rolls\nSometimes you'll have to make an &quot;accuracy roll&quot;. This is essentially the same as your accuracy, but you replace the base 10 with a 1d20 roll. In other words, it's 1d20+(DEX/10) plus any other Accuracy abilities. When something penalizes both Accuracy and d20 rolls, apply only the penalties to Accuracy; if it penalizes only d20 rolls, however, then those penalties also apply.\n\n\n###     c.  Damage\nEvery attack has a &quot;base damage&quot;, a number of dice of a certain size you roll. For example, a basic unarmed attack does 2d4 of base damage. The actual damage formula is,\n(Base Damage) + (Damage Bonus) * (Speed) + (any other bonuses)\n\nYour damage bonus is the value determined by your STR (for most attacks) or CHA (for ninjutsu). The damage bonus is multiplied by speed to represent that slower, more solid attacks are able to better benefit from your raw power. Some abilities may add bonus damage, but unless they explicitly say so, this does not affect your stat-based &quot;Damage Bonus.&quot;\n\nDamage is done to an opponent's Vitality unless stated otherwise, until that reaches 0. Any overflow, and all future damage, goes straight to their Hit Points.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, any alterations of an action's Speed also affect its damage bonus; faster isn't always better.\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n4. Defense\n------------------------------\n\nInevitably, you will at some point be attacked. Accordingly, ninja are trained to defend themselves in a variety of ways. Normally, you may only use a single defense against any given attack.\n\n###     a.  Dodge (Speed 2, Interrupt)\nThe best defense against any attack is simply not being hit. When you dodge an attack you roll 1d20+(AGI)/10, plus any other bonuses to dodge you may have, such as from abilities or uniques, against the attack's Accuracy. Success means you completely avoid the attack and its effects.\n\n\n###     b.  Parry (Speed 3, Interrupt)\nThis entails deflecting an opponent's weapon with your own, or stopping their unarmed attacks with your bare hands. Accordingly, weapon attacks may only be parried with weapons, and unarmed attacks may only be parried if you have at least one hand free to do so. Parrying works similarly to dodging, though uses an Accuracy roll to determine its success.\n\nWhen something (such as Fatigue) penalizes both Accuracy and defensive rolls (or rolls in general), Parry only suffers the penalty to defensive rolls; if something penalizes only Accuracy, then Parry does suffer that penalty. Basically, it doesn't have to deal with 'double jeopardy'.\n\n###     c.  Block\nBlocking is bracing yourself for an attack as effectively as possible, and being on guard to do so at a moment's notice. Blocking is special in that you cannot choose to block at a moment's notice. However, if your last action was to begin blocking (see 'Block' in actions, above), you may automatically block any attack made against you. This is an option; you could still choose to dodge instead, if you desired, and then block the next attack that came your way.\n\nBlocking reduced the damage of unarmed and ninjutsu attacks by 50%. However, weapon damage is only reduced by 25%; while it's all well and good to keep a punch away from your vitals, a sword cut is nasty business no matter where it lands.\n\n\n###     d.  Jutsu\nSome taijutsu and ninjutsu techniques may provide special defensive options. Most of these are Interrupts, but the rules for exactly how they work will be listed within the description of the actual techniques.\n\n\n###     e.  Partial Success\nJust because you failed to evade a shuriken or deflect a sword slash doesn't mean they struck a vital area. When you make a defensive roll to avoid an attack, for each point you fail by you take 20% damage. Any status effects that are part of the technique, however, will apply normally.\n\nThat can be confusing, so, it's example time! So you roll a 14 on your dodge, against an Accuracy 15 attack. You failed by 1 point, so you take 20% of the attack's normal damage. Had you rolled a 12, you would take 60% damage. And, if you had rolled a 7 (failing by 8 points) you would take the full, 100% damage.\n\nWith regards to defensive jutsu: Partial success typically applies to any jutsu which works similar to a dodge or parry. That is, you make a d20 roll, and if successful the attack you are defending against does not hit you. However, if the technique has another effect (such as make a d20 roll, and if you succeed you reduce the attack's damage by a set amount), partial success does not apply. Exceptions to this will be noted otherwise in the individual technique's description.\n\n\n###   f. Damage Reduction\nSome effects, such as uniques and clan abilities, provide damage reduction (DR). This reduces incoming damage directly: if you have 10 DR, and an attack does 100 damage, you would only take 90 damage from it.\n\nDamage reduction is applied before blocking or partial defense.\n\n====================\n5. Willpower\n------------------------------\n\nNinja are capable of incredible feats, and some are truly exceptional, performing astonishing deeds in the face of adversity. While you can be as determined (or not) as you please, Willpower represents your ability to use that determination to push yourself above and beyond your limits.\n\nYou can spend Willpower any time you attack, or make a d20 roll, after you've seen the action's normal results. When you spend a point of Willpower, reroll whichever roll it was used on (or, in the case of an attack, make an Accuracy Roll). If the d20 result is less than 11, add 10 to it; this is your new result for that action.\n\nWillpower may not, however, be used to reroll Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls.\n\nYou may also choose to spend Willpower after someone else has done so to alter the result of their action. However, any given roll or attack may only have Willpower applied to it one time.</text>\n\n\\page\n#   Actions (Advanced)\n   >1. Advanced Actions\n######   a. Take the Hit\n######   b. Delay\n######   c. Abort\n   >2. Multi-Throwing\n   >3. Action Chains\n\n====================\n1. Advanced Actions\n------------------------------\n\n###     a. Take The Hit (Speed 6, Interrupt)\nTaking the hit is the glorious move the stronger person or sensei uses to protect their weaker ally! You make a dodge roll with a +5 bonus; if successful, you've leapt in the way of an attack aimed at your ally. If you fail, your ally takes 20% of the damage per point you failed by. (For example: If you fail by 2 points, you'd take 60% damage, and your ally 40% damage).\n\nIf you were blocking when you used this, you make block as long as you were successful by 1 point or more. You may also use interrupts to defend yourself, up to a maximum Speed of how many points your Take The Hit roll beat the opponent's accuracy; you can't dodge, but you could parry, or use a ninjutsu-based defense that raises a protective wall.\n\n\n###     b.  Delay (Speed N/A)\nDelay is not, properly speaking, an action in and of itself, but rather a quality certain actions have. For an example of how this might be written, an attack could have &quot;Speed 12, Delay 4&quot;. This means that while it would be declared normally on your turn, its effects would take place 4 initiative counts later. The action may be aborted any time up to the last IC of the delay.\n\nFor example, using the above attack on IC 10, you would have until IC 14 to abort; on IC 14 itself, so long as you did not abort the attack's effects would be resolved normally, and you would then act again on IC 22. An action's Speed may not be reduced below its Delay.\n\n\n###     c.  Abort (Speed 1, or Speed +1)\nCertain actions will say they can be aborted, or just list &quot;Abort&quot; as one of their qualities along with speed (such as the Perform Handseals action). Aborting may declared on any initiative count before your next action, allowing you to act on the following IC. When you abort an action, you stop performing it; exactly what this entails will usually be discussed in the individual actions.\n\nAlternately, you may choose to Abort as part of an Interrupt--for example, aborting handseals so you can perform a defensive ninjutsu technique. This adds 1 to the Speed of that Interrupt.\n\n\n====================\n2. Multi-Throwing\n------------------------------\n\nAnyone familiar with fictionalized depictions of ninja has no doubt seen them flinging a handful of shuriken with pinpoint aim. As this game is about fictional ninjas, it stands to reason that they can do this! The term, appropriately enough, is &quot;Multi-Throwing.&quot;\n\nIt helps to first be familiar with the two weapons you'll be throwing the most: They are the shuriken (weighing in at 1d6 damage) and the kunai (beating it out with 2d6).\n\nWhile you could certainly throw a single shuriken or kunai (that would be a basic weapon attack, and full stats for doing so are listed in those weapons' equipment entries), a real ninja would throw a bunch at once.\n\nBy default, you may only throw one type of weapon at once; you could throw 6 shuriken, but not 4 shuriken and 2 kunai in the same action. After choosing your weapon, you decide how many you want to throw. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the multi-throw action.\n\n\n###     a.  Multi-Throw (Speed and Stamina Variable)\nYou throw at least 2 weapons, up to a maximum of DEX/10. The Speed is 3 + (number of weapons thrown)/2, and the Stamina cost is 5, +1 for every 2 weapons (6 for 2-3, 7 for 4-5, and so forth). Regardless of how many weapons you throw, the minimum total Speed of a multi-throw action is 5--this applies to both its base Speed, and its final Speed after any changes (such as spending AP).\n\nThe rolled damage is the total for all weapons thrown; 6 shuriken would roll 6d6. Your damage bonus is increased by +0.5 for every thrown weapon. So, if you had 60 STR in the above multi-throw, your damage bonus would be (60/15 = 4, 4 + 0.5*6 = 4+3 =) 7. The attack would be Speed (3 + 6/2) 6 and Stamina 8, and have a damage formula of:\n6d6+7*6\n\nIf you are multi-throwing shuriken, their +2 Accuracy is applied only once. You do need to choose between shuriken or kunai when you multi-throw; you can't mix-and-match, tragically.\n\nBecause wounds represent severe damage from a single powerful attack, and multi-throws are multiple weaker injuries delivered at once, the severity of all wounds caused by multi-throws is reduced by one category, to a minimum of Minor.\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n3. Action Chains\n------------------------------\n\nChains are a special type of action, where multiple techniques are combined or used at once. Each chain has a single Core action, and one or more Links. Your core action can be virtually any action in the PHB, from dodging an attack to using a high-ranked ninjutsu. What makes an action a Chain is, instead, its Links. Links are techniques which, rather than being used alone (or sometimes as an alternative to that), can be used to supplement or modify another action.\n\nThe easiest way to identify a Link is that rather than its own Speed value (like &quot;Speed: 4&quot;), it will say something like &quot;Speed: +4&quot;. Many of these also have Stamina or Chakra costs written as a number to be added or subtracted. In the description of these techniques, they'll specify what they do, and when they can be used (for example, Kawarimi is linked to a Dodge action; and the E-rank Water-Gathering Technique can be linked to many suiton ninjutsu).\n\nUsing a chain is fairly simple. Simply sum up the Speeds and costs of all actions involved; these are the values for the Chain, which is treated as one single, complete action. For example, using Water-Gathering with Water Sphere is a single action with a Chakra cost of 10 and a Seal Speed of 8. When you apply Kawarimi to a dodge, &quot;Dodge + Kawarimi&quot; is your new action, with a base Speed of 6.\n\nAny effects which modify an action's Speed (or other variables) do so to the Chain itself, not individual links (or the core action). In the case of Chains where the Core action is a damage-dealing attack, this becomes slightly more complicated. The Speed value used for your (Speed)*(appropriate Damage Bonus) will be the lower of the Core action's base Speed, or the Chain's final Speed (after all modifications), whichever is lower. The rank of the Core technique determines the rank of the chain; chains using Shuurai (a D-rank Raiton) would always be treated as D-rank attacks, even if you added an A-rank link to them.\n\nThere is no limit to how many links a chain may have. You could, for example, make a Chain out of Leaping Shadow Evasion (Core), Phantom Step (Link), Water Splash (Link) and, after that failed, Kawarimi (Link), all for a single dodge. This action would have a Chakra cost of 10 (5+5, from Kawarimi and Mizuhane), and a fairly high Stamina cost (depending on how much effort you put into your Phantom Step).</text>\n\n\\page\n#   Stealth\n  >1. Hiding \n######   a. Hide\n######   b. Improve Hiding\n  >2. Stealth Levels\n######   a. Stealth, Level 1\n######   b. Stealth, Level 2\n######   c. Stealth, Level 3\n  >3. Searching\n######   a. Search\n######   b. Point Out\n  >4. Actions From Stealth\n######   a. Surprise Attack\n######   b. Prepare Sneak Attack\n######   c. Sneak Attack\n######   d. Genjutsu\n\n====================\n1. Hiding\n------------------------------\n\nNinja hide. It's sort of their... thing. That said, hiding can be accomplished under one of four circumstances:\n\n1. Nobody is watching you. Well, nobody you're trying to hide from. This automatically prevents usage in combat, though see the other two situations.\n\n2. Everyone you are trying to hide from has a -6 or higher visibility penalty.\n\n3. You are already hidden, and taking another Hide action in hopes of getting a new, higher Stealth TN.\n\n4. You use a jutsu which explicitly allows you to hide as one of its effects. Note that when you hide this way, the Hide action itself is reduced to Speed 0.\n\nOnce you meet one of those requirements, you may hide. Hiding is, of course, an action! When hidden, you may not be targeted by enemy attacks (because they don't know where you are!). It's possible to be hidden from some people, but not others.\n\n\n###     a.  Hide (Speed 10)\nMake a Stealth skill roll; the result becomes your &quot;Stealth TN&quot; (target number), how hard it is to find you. You are hidden at level 1 Stealth.\n\nFor every time you've hidden in a battle, your future Stealth rolls to hide have a -5 penalty (the third time you hid yourself, you'd have a -10 penalty; this applies even if you're hiding with jutsu or other effects).\n\n```\n```\n\n\n###     b.  Improve Hiding (Speed 7)\nThis action may be performed only while hiding at level 1 stealth. You take the time to make sure you're properly hidden and settle into place, moving you up to level 2 stealth. In case that wasn't clear, this cannot, by itself, take you from level 2 to level 3 stealth.\n\n\n====================\n2. Stealth Levels\n------------------------------\n\nThere are three levels of stealth, corresponding to different degrees of being hidden. Each level has limitations on what can be done on it; for example, in Level 2 and Level 3 Stealth, you cannot move. Thus, if you were at Stealth 3, and chose to spend an action moving, you would immediately be dropped to Stealth 1.\n\n\n###     a.  Stealth, Level 1\nStealth 1 is as poorly concealed as you can be while still being unseen by your enemies. Your Stealth TN has no bonus at this rank. You may move and perform surprise attacks, as well as using items.\n\n\n###     b.  Stealth, Level 2\nStealth 2 corresponds to being fairly well-hidden, having taken the time to adjust yourself and your hiding spot as necessary--you're not sticking your feet out past the edge of the rock you're hiding behind, for example. From Stealth 2 you may perform surprise attacks, use items, and prepare and perform sneak attacks. At this level of stealth, your Stealth TN has a +5 bonus.\n\n\n###     c.  Stealth, Level 3\nStealth 3 is as well-hidden as you can be. You are somehow camouflaged, blending into your environment excellently. You may not move or attack, but your Stealth TN has a +15 bonus.\n\n\n====================\n3. Searching\n------------------------------\n\nUnderstandably, situations arise when ninja want to find other, hidden ninja.\n\\page\n\n\n\n###     a. Search (Speed 6)\nYou look for hidden enemies, using your keen ninja senses. When you make this action, roll your Awareness skill and compare it to the Stealth TNs of all hidden enemies. If you get equal to or greater than someone's Stealth TN, you have found them. As far as you're concerned, they're no longer in stealth; they cannot perform surprise or sneak attacks against you, you can attack them, and so forth.\n\nEvery time you use a Search action consecutively (without taking a non-Interrupt action between them) you get a stacking +2 bonus. Thus, your third attempt to find someone would use your Awareness skill +4.\n\nIf you are the one doing the hiding, you do not automatically know that someone has discovered yor hiding place; until they do something indicating they know where you are (such as attacking you, or running straight at you), you think you're still hidden from them.\n\n###     b. Point Out (Speed 3)\nYou indicate where an enemy is hiding, typically by pointing at them and yelling &quot;There he is!&quot; loudly. This allows anyone else present to make a Search action immediately, as a Speed 0 Interrupt, with an additional +5 bonus.\n\n\n====================\n4. Actions From Stealth\n------------------------------\n\n###     a. Surprise Attack\nAny attack you make while hidden is a surprise attack. Performing a surprise attack ends your stealth, as you leap out and attack, or otherwise reveal your location in the process.\n\nIf an opponent chooses to use an Interrupt to defend against your surprise attack, they may not lower its Speed by spending Action Points.\n\nNon-jutsu attacks with ranged weapons do not end your stealth. However, each time you perform one it reduces your Stealth TN by 5.\n\n\n###     b. Prepare Sneak Attack (Speed Variable, Abort)\nYou take the time to line up a perfect attack. You may abort this action at any time, either as a normal abort, or to make your next action a sneak attack.\n\nTo use an action as a sneak attack, the total Speed that you used your Prepare Sneak Attack action for must be at least equal to that of the action you're using as a sneak attack. If you take another action instead (such as moving to a new hiding spot, via another use of the Hide action), you lose your opportunity to Sneak Attack.\n\n\n###     c.  Sneak Attack\nA sneak attack is an improved surprise attack, and as such, all normal rules for surprise attacks apply. Additionally, any Accuracy penalties inherent to the technique or weapon you're using are removed. Penalties from other sources, such as visibility or wounds, are not negated.\n\nA sneak attack may be used as a special type of Interrupt. You can Interrupt any action, taken by any person, with a sneak attack. They may either complete their action, and be automatically hit by your sneak attack, or call off their action and defend against your attack normally. If they call their action off they do not pay its cost, but their next action is still determined by their action's normal Speed.\n\nSneak attacks may interrupt other actions as if their Speed was 1/4 is actual value. For example, you have been preparing a sneak attack for 18 initiative counts, when your opponent declares a basic unarmed attack (Speed 8) against your ally, on IC 80. You declare a sneak attack interrupt. You use a taijutsu technique which normally has 30 Speed; you spend 14 action points to lower its Speed to 16 (less than your 18 ICs of preparation). It now interrupts as if it was Speed (16/4 =) 4, which is half of the unarmed attack's 8, making it a valid interrupt. Your opponent would be wise to call off their attack; if they do so, they will not roll Stamina for their attack, they'll have their next action on IC 88, and they can defend with any Interrupt of Speed 8 (16/2 = 8) or lower.\n\n\n###     d. Genjutsu\nGenjutsu can be used from level 1 and 2 stealth, and unlike other jutsus does not break your concealment. However, it can never be a sneak or surprise attack. Genjutsu techniques which require your opponent to be able to perceive you cannot, for reasons that should be largely self-evident, be used on somebody who you're hiding from.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n================---================\nPursuit\n================---================\n\n## Starting a Pursuit: \n\nIf you and all the members of the squad you wish to form together with are out of combat, or 100 Yards away from any (visible) enemy in combat, you may start a Pursuit. This either reflects you going somewhere, chasing someone, or running away from someone! You can do this with any number of ninja, but a minimum of 3 is required for a Formation. \n\nThere are three important choices you must make when starting a pursuit. If you are being thrown into a pursuit on the fly, read the rules below marked with +++, otherwise, you first pick a Team Captain, a Tactic, and finally a Formation.\n\nTeam Captain - You nominate one of the ninja in your squad to make the decisions for your group, it is important during a pursuit to do things quickly without thinking, so the Captain delegates commands to others, controlling the actions of the squad.\n\n  -  Once you have chosen your Team Captain, determine your squad's Squad Speed. This is based on the lowest speed of any member of your squad. Many things will add or remove percantages to this. It will come up a lot, so remember this number! \n\n## How it Works: \n\nThe distances squads can be apart are as follows, and are represented in combat by a number of asterisks. They are also often referred to as degrees: \nVery Close(1),\nClose(2),\nNearby(3),\nFar(4),\nVery Far(5)\n\n\nBoth Team Captains roll their initiatives, then both teams start Nearby. Any members of either team use techniques to buff themselves at this moment as long as they are speed 10 or less. If there was any hidden enemies nearby you start 1 degree closer as the Hunted (or further, if you are the Hunter).  Unlike normal combat IC, you each alternate turns, each action listed taking a whole turn. Every turn, you gain 10% Squad Speed at the start. After both parties have had a turn, you both compare Squad Speeds and the higher speed moves a degree in their favor (Hunted move 1 away, Hunters move 1 closer). Gaining or losing speed cannot cause you to go over +50% or under -50%, unless otherwise stated. You continue to take turns this way until one party is caught or gets away.\n\n\nTactics - The way your team has decided on moving together gives you distinct advantages and disadvantages. The different tactics effect how you build speed and what you can do during a pursuit. \n\n  -  Force - Anytime your Squad speed would decrease, it decreases by half the percentage. This includes when it changes to another Formation and/or Tactic. You can use the Stop! action from Close, and the Escape! action from Far. Your squad cannot be broken.\n  -  Stealth - You only gain 5% Squad Speed per turn instead of the standard 10%, but your speed cannot be reduced except by changing Formation and/or Tactic. When you use a Volley you can choose to hit them from the sides or center, or with a -5 penalty hit them from the back (or front, if you are the Hunter). When you use the Ambush action, you can do it from one degree further away. You also may use a Stealth -10 in place of any defensive roll.\n  -  Cunning - When you gain a percentage speed bonus by any means, you can instead apply it as a penalty to the enemy squad. When targetting a trap, you can choose 2 locations and roll a 1d2, or with a -5 penalty you can choose which direction you want it to hit from. As the Hunter, this makes your successful volleys knock the Hunted one closer and you can use a volley from Far with a -10 penalty.\n  -  Speed - Your percentage caps are raised to +100% max speed and -100% minimum. You gain +20% passively at the start of each turn instead of the regular +10%, but any penalty to your speed is twice the amount, and anything that moves your squad in a way other than what you'd like moves you that way twice the amount. This includes when it changes to another Formation or Tactic.\n\n\nFormations - The actual formation your squad moves in has vulnerabilities and strengths of it's own. If a formation is hit from it's vulnerable side, it is Broken until the squad assumes a new formation. Any bonus you gain from a formation gains an additional +1 for every member you have over 3 in your squad.\n\n  -  Line - Running in a line, one man leading single-file all the way to the end. You get a +5 to any Athletics and Resistance roll and you are vulnerable to flanking. (The Side)\n  -  Cross - The group is in a short line, with people branching out from the front to cover the sides. You get +5 Stealth. Vulnerable to an attack from above. (The Back)\n  -  Circular - The group covers a nice area, seeing all around them equally. You get +5 to any Awareness and Survival checks your squad makes and you are vulnerable to direct assault. (Center)\n  -  V-Shaped - One ninja in the front, then fanning out to both sides. You get +5 to any Espionage checks your squad makes and you are vulnerable to rear assault. (The Front)\n  -  Broken - This is what your squad counts as if it has less than 3 members, or something causes it to break. You no longer gain a passive +10% speed per turn. If for some reason you cannot decide on a squad leader, you are similiarly Broken.\n\\page\n\n\n+++ If you were forced into a pursuit, either by fleeing from an enemy, or from an enemy fleeing from you, there is a special way to handle this! First, both teams get -50% Squad Speed for it being so abrupt. After rolling initiatives, starting with the Team Captains, the teams take turns voting on a Strategy and Tactic. First the Team Captain from the Squad that won initiative votes, then the other team's Captain and one other member vote, then two from the original team, then alternating two members until there are none left. At the end, the Hunter's Team Captain chooses a Strategy and Tactic. For every vote they had for the ones they end up choosing, they get +10% Speed. (This means if two members of your team voted for Force and V-Shaped, and you voted for some different ones, but chose Force and V-Shaped, you'd get +40% Squad Speed! 2 Votes for Force + 2 Votes for V-Shaped) The Hunted chooses this as well, afterward, then the Pursuit begins.\n\n\nActions in a Pursuit:\n\nThere are two groups in a Pursuit, the Hunted (The ones being chased) and the Hunter (The ones chasing). There are some actions they can both take and some actions only the Hunter or Hunted can take. Any action which calls for a skill roll uses the highest skill roll in your squad, and only their roll. Any attack done by the Hunter can target the back of the Hunted squad, or the center. Any attack done by the Hunted can target the front of the Hunter squad, or the center.\n\nGeneral Actions:\n\n  -  Change Tactic and/or Formation - Doing this causes you to choose a new Tactic and/or Formation, but you lose 30% Squad Speed.\n\n  -  Press On - You gain a +20% bonus to your Squad Speed.\n\n  -  Taijutsu Volley - This is (for the purposes of damage only) a Speed 10 attack with (Athletics Rank)/5d12, with physical damage bonus. Being hit by a volley lowers your Squad Speed by 10%. This can hit anyone up to Nearby, it's damage being dealt to the whole enemy Squad, and it's strike is an Athletics vs. Athletics or Resistance. You can choose to do either Slashing, Piercing, or Blunt wounds with this. When you attack with this, as the Hunter you hit the Hunted from the back, and the Hunted use this to hit the Hunter from the front. You can choose to make your Athletics check at a -5 penalty to roll [1d4] and hit the enemy from a random location. (1=Center, 2=Back, 3=Front, 4=Sides)\n\n  -  Ninjutsu Volley - This is (for the purposes of damage only) a Speed 10 attack with Chakra Control Ranks/5d12, with ninjutsu damage bonus. Being hit by a volley lowers your Squad Speed by 10%. This can hit anyone up to Nearby, it's damage is dealt to the whole enemy squad, and it's strike is an Chakra Control vs. Athletics or Resistance. You can choose any element someone in your squad can use for wounds. When you attack with this, as the Hunter you hit the Hunted from the back, and the Hunted use this to hit the Hunter from the front. You can choose to make your Athletics check at a -5 penalty to roll [1d4] and hit the enemy from a random location. (1=Center, 2=Back, 3=Front, 4=Sides)\n\n  -  Illusionary Assault - You can lower the bonus percentage cap a squad can benefit from for their next turn. (A squad that could move +50% faster can now only get to +25% faster) If you lose speed from this, you do not gain it back when your cap returns to normal. This is a standard Genjutsu roll, using the highest from both squads. This can be done from Nearby.\n\n  -  Ambush - As the Hunter, you need to have successfully sent a member to Cut-Off the enemy. You can then use this if you're at least Close range. As Hunted you need to use it while they are Close or further away. Roll a Stealth vs. Awareness (This is at a -10 if you are the Hunted), if you succeed, you get into Ambush position and you start combat, with each member who was part of the Ambush starting in Level 2 Stealth, with a +10 bonus to their initiative. If you fail, combat still starts, but the Ambushers have a -10 to their Initiative and are not in Stealth. When the Hunted are Ambushing, it's their whole Squad who get these penalties or bonuses, when it's the Hunter, it's only the members sent in the cut-off.\n\n\nHunter Actions:\n\n  -  Cut-off - You send a member or two of your squad up and around, to try and position yourself for a nice Ambush. At the end of the Hunted's next turn, roll an Espionage vs. Survival. If you succeed, you are in position, and on your next 2 actions can use Ambush.\n\n  -  Stop! - If you are in the Very Close position, the Pursuit is over, the hunted is stopped, your side begins combat with +5 on each player on your side's initiative.\n\n  -  Give Up the Chase - You can choose to move two degrees away, if this would move you further than very far, you give up chasing. Just in case they wanted to turn back around on you at one point. If you do this three times but somehow don't leave pursuit they can choose to start a new pursuit, with you as the Hunted, starting from the distance you left off.\n\n\\page\n\nHunted Actions:\n\n  -  Traps - Put down some traps! You lose 10% Squad Speed to set up traps. At the end of the Hunter's next turn, roll 1d4, as well as an Espionage vs. Survival. The 1d4 determines the direction the traps strike from (1= Front, 2= Sides, 3=Back, 4=Center) If the Hunters fail their Survival, their squad is moved one degree away. They also each take (Espionage Ranks)/5d10 damage, with no damage bonus. \n\n  -  Escape! - If you are in the Very Far position, the Pursuit is over, you have gotten away! It will take them a minimum of one hour to pick up a reliable set of tracks.\n\n  -  Sacrifice!!! - One of your members breaks off from your formation and leads the enemy team away. They automatically get one degree further away. The member who broke off now counts as a seperate squad and their tactic is set to stealth. There are three things the Hunter can choose on their next turn: To continue to pursue the main group, to pursue this 'new group' or to let one of their members leave their group to 1v1 the guy.\n</text>\n\\page\n# Combat\n   >1.

Conditions\n------------------------------\n\nConditions cover the overall health, well-being, and, well, condition, of your character. This lists the conditions, what they do, and where to find more information about them. For how to remove unwanted conditions, see the 'Recovery' section of this chapter.\n\n###     a.  Wounded\nTrained ninja can survive things that would kill or maim lesser humans, but sometimes a single blow will be so powerful that even their chakra-empowered, well-conditioned bodies cannot simply shrug off. These are referred to as Wounds, and are explained in detail in the 'Wounds' section of this chapter. The effects, and healing requirements, for each type of wound can be found there.\n\n###     b.  Fatigued\nThis is the result of (over)exerting oneself in battle. Rules for Fatigue, including how it's gained and the effects it has, are found in the 'Fatigue' section.\n\n###     c.  Incapacitated\nWhen your HP reaches 0, you are incapacitated. You're not necessarily unconscious, and you can still talk, but you're helpless, completely unable to take any kind of action or effectively defend yourself. An enemy who wants to can knock you unconscious with a single blow, or deliver a coup de grace (A speed 10 attack that cannot be lowered by any means) to render you dead.\n```\n```\n\n\n###     d.  Unconscious\nOne step up from incapacitated, this can result from being deliberately knocked out, or from severe Fatigue. When unconscious you are subject to all rules for being incapacitated, but cannot even talk or perceive your environment.\n\n###     e.  Dead\nDying isn't as easy for ninja as normal people. There are two main ways you can die. The first is simple, overwhelming damage: If you are reduced to -100% HP, you die. The second is a coup de grace, a blow specifically designed to be lethal. You may deliver a Coup de Grace only against an Incapacitated or Unconscious opponent. A Coup de Grace is a Speed 10, Delay 5 melee-ranged action.\n\n\n====================\n2. Status Effects\n------------------------------\n\nStatus effects are things that will come and go throughout the course of battle. They come in many forms, and from many different sources.\n\nSome status effects may occur automatically; most of the time. Others, however, allow you a roll to avoid them. Typically, this will be called a &quot;status roll&quot;, or a &quot;(specific status, such as burn) roll&quot;. Saying that the victim gets a Resistance roll against the effect is equivalent to saying that it has a status roll.\n\nThese rolls are either Chakra Control (for ninjutsu), Athletics (for taijutsu--but this is uncommon, as those effects are usually automatic), or Toxicology (for poisons). If anything else, that will be noted.\n\nAs implied above, the defender makes a Resistance skill check; if they equal or exceed the status roll, they avoid its effects. If not, they suffer them in full. Do keep in mind, if a technique or effect doesn't say it allows a roll, that probably means any special effects it has occur automatically.\n\n\nMany of these status effects will be found on damaging attacks--for example, a sword slash that also causes its victim to start bleeding profusely. If the damage of such an attack is reduced to 0, none of its status effects will take place--with a few exceptions. Specifically, Immobilize and Paralysis will apply even if the attack causing them doesn't deal damage.\nPoison sometimes has special rules in this regard, but they can be found in the appropriate section of the Equipment chapter.\n\n\\page\n\n###     a.  Bleed\nProfuse bleeding from an injury. Among other things, this can ruin your clothes; bloodstains absolutely refuse to come out of most fabrics.\n\nWhile bleeding, you lose Vitality (or HP) equal to double the severity of the Bleed status every 5 IC, and have a penalty to your Stamina rolls equal to its severity. Every 20 IC, you reduce the severity of the status by RES/30 (after taking the damage).\n\nBleeds from the same source do not stack; the higher one overwrites the lower. Bleeds from different sources, however, all do their damage separately, though you still use only the highest Bleed to determine your Stamina penalty from the status.\n\n\n###     b.  Burns\nGenerally resulting from exposure to fire or intense heat, such as some katon jutsu, being burnt makes it harder to fight effectively. Your Stamina rolls suffer a penalty equal to the strength of the burns on you.\n\nYou can suffer from multiple burn effects at the same time, though only the strongest penalty is actually applied. Any effects which reduce Stamina penalties reduce the severity of all your burns by the same amount. Accordingly, when you move to the next Fatigue category you are cleared of all burn effects.\n\n\n###     c.  Ignite\nYou are on fire. Literally, you are burning. This is probably one of the most excruciatingly painful experiences of your life.\n\nIgnite's effects are somewhat complicated. Like most statuses, it has a severity. You suffer a -severity/2 penalty to your Stealth checks, and every 5 IC you take damage equal to its severity, plus its severity in percent of your current Vitality. Thus, an Ignite 10 would give you -5 to your Stealth and would deal 10 damage, plus 10% of your current Vitality. Each time it does damage, you subtract (RES/20) from its severity.\n\nIf you have no Vitality remaining, it instead does damage equal to its severity in percent of your maximum HP. The above Ignite 10 effect would deal 10% of your maximum HP in damage.\n\nIf someone ignites you again while you are already on fire (seriously, what kind of people are you fighting?), the more severe effect replaces the less severe one.\n\n\n###     d.  Immobility\nImmobilization effects are ones such as being stuck in mud or partially bound with ropes. Every point of immobilization reduces your accuracy and defense rolls by 1, and your AGI for the purposes of movement by 10%. Immobilization 10 is &quot;completely immobilized&quot;; you cannot move at all, being rooted to your location (you could still attack and even attempt to dodge, just at a severe penalty). No matter how high your an immobilization penalty gets, its actual applied penalty can never go beyond -10. Multiple immobilization penalties do not stack; if you're suffering from a -8 and a -4, you ignore the -4 until the -8 goes away.\n\n```\n```\n\n\n###     e.  Paralysis\nParalysis differs from immobilization in that paralysis is an internal or mental effect which impedes your ability to move, whereas immobilization is generally used for effects which somehow physically restrain you. \n\nWhen paralyzed, the base Speed of all your actions is increased by the paralysis rating, to a maximum of double their original Speed. At the same time, when determining damage from your attacks treat their Speed as if it was (Paralysis severity) lower.\n\nFor example, at Paralysis 3 your basic unarmed attack would be Speed 11; you could reduce it to a minimum of Speed (11/2 = 5.5) 6 with AP, and then it would multiply your damage bonus by (6 - 3) 3. That same Paralysis would change your dodge to a Speed 4 Interrupt (meaning that some extremely quick, previously-avoidable attacks might become undodgeable).\n\nParalysis effects do not combine. If you are afflicted with two paralysis effects at once, the more potent one overwrites the less severe one. If they both have the same severity, the one with the longer duration overwrites the other.\n\n\n###     f.  Poison\nWhen affected by a poison, you make a Resistance roll against some roll of the opponent's. Success means that you shrug off the effects of the poison. Failure means that you have been poisoned.\n\nActual poisons may carry any number of effects, but the most prominent is poison damage. For every IC that passes, you take damage equal to the poison's rating, for the full duration of the poison. For example, you're affected by a Poison 5 with a duration of 12. You take 5 damage per IC, each IC, until 12 counts after when you were first affected, for a total of 60 damage.\n\nYou may be affected simultaneously by multiple poisons. However, a single source (a specific jutsu or type of venom) may only affect you once; another application of it while under its effects simply renews the duration.\n\n\\page\n\n###     g.  Sleep\nPeople sleep, generally because it's a necessary bodily function, but sometimes because they've been influenced by mind-affecting genjutsu. In reality, sleeping people are pretty much helpless. However, ninja develop a sixth sense that warns them of impending danger and functions even when not awake.\n\nIf someone tries to attack or sneak up on you while asleep you automatically wake up and can still roll initiative and/or defend yourself, though do so at a -5 penalty until your first action after waking up.\n\n\n###     h.  Stun\nActions which stun you delay your actions by the magnitude of the stun. For example, if your next action is on IC 14, and you are affected by a Stun 5 effect, your next action would be on IC 19.\n\nMultiple stuns do not stack, but a newer one of higher magnitude will overwrite the older. Thus, using the above example, if you were hit by a Stun 7, your next action would be on IC (14+7) 21; if you were then hit by a Stun 3, there would be no change.\n\n\n###     i.  Suffocation\nSomeone or something is hindering your ability to breathe. Suffocation penalties stack, from different sources or multiple ones. Your suffocation penalty is applied to any Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls you make, and every time its value increases you have to make a Stamina 15 roll.\n\nUnlike normal Fatigue-related penalties, suffocation is not reset to 0 when your Fatigue advances. When you stop being suffocated, your suffocation penalty is reduced by 1 every 5 initiative counts.\n\n\n###     j.  Visibility\nThese are penalties which reduce a person's ability to see clearly, impairing the use of their most valuable sense in combat. Visibility penalties do not stack; if you have a -6 and a -2, you ignore the -2 until the -6 is gone. The maximum visibility penalty you can suffer from (after any increases and reductions) is -10.\n\nTotal blindness is a -10 visibility penalty; one eye closed (or removed!) is -3. A visibility penalty reduces your Accuracy and Awareness by its value, and your defensive rolls by half (rounded down) of its value; even without their sight, a ninja's sixth sense often alerts them to danger and allows them to respond.\n\nMany visibility penalties affect areas: clouds of smoke or mist and the like. In this case, you suffer the penalty when inside it, or when trying to attack or watch (but not defend against) someone inside it.\n\nIf it ever becomes relevant, closing or opening your eyes is a Speed 0 action--but not an Interrupt.\n\n\n====================\n3. Other Effects\n------------------------------\n\n###     a.  Area of Effect\nCertain things apply not to an individual, but to all things within a given area--their &quot;area of effect&quot;, or AoE. These include things like explosions and smoke bombs\n\nThe simpler type of AoEs are ones which are not directly offensive, such as a smoke bomb or a jutsu that creates a thick cloud of mist. These apply certain effects so long as you're in them, and can only be avoided by moving out.\n\nOthers, however, are attacks: they cause damage to everyone within an area. Depending on that area, it may not even be possible to avoid one effectively.\n\nWhen being subjected to an AoE attack, the first thing to determine is if you can dodge it effectively. To do this, take the attack's Speed, and determine how far you could move (see 'Actions') in that time. If that distance is greater than the effect's radius, then congratulations, you can dodge normally. If not, you have a -2 penalty to Dodge per yard you're short by.\n\nAs AoEs are not, strictly speaking, targeting you, they generally cannot be parried. Other defenses, such as raising a ninjutsu-based wall, are typically effective.\n\n\n###     b.  Knockback\nCertain jutsu have an effect referred to as &quot;knockback&quot;, which does about what it sounds like: pushes you away from its user or point of origin. Knockback is measured in yards; a 10 yard knockback means that, if you are hit, you will be moved 10 yards away from wherever the jutsu originated from.\n\nSome may have more complex rules, such as pushing you to the edge of their area of effect.\n\nWhen a technique knocks you back a certain number of yards, if partial defense applies then you will also reduce the knockback by that amount.\n\nThe exception is area-of-effect knock backs centered on an individual (such as a Hyuuga's Kaiten and the A-rank jutsu Eye of the Storm): partial defense does not reduce the knockback from these, as they essentially &quot;push&quot; everything away from them equally.\n\n\n###     c. Clones and Conditions\nAny clones you summon are subject to the same statuses and conditions you are suffering from at the time you summon them. This includes wounds or any status effect.\n\nNote: It may be a bad idea to make clones while on fire.</text>\n\\page\n\n# Weather Conditions\nWeather Conditions\nThere are a variety of conditions that happen in the world and many of them can interfere with or change what you're doing. If you are safely in the confines of your village, you do not have to use weather (Though you can), but outside in a scene you must refer to the bottom of this node.\n\nFog\n-6 Visibility Penalty.\nBeyond 50 yards, the Visibility Penalty is doubled.\n\nHeavy Rain \n-2 Visibility Penalty.\nImmobilization Penalty 1.\n-5 to Survival when Tracking.\nFor any Suiton you use, there always counts as being 5 free gallons you can use per technique.\nThis adds a +3 Chakra cost to each Katon jutsu.\n\nSnow\nParalysis 1 Always, unless you have D-rank Suiton Technique Pool of Water or Waterwalking.\n+5 to Survival when Tracking.\n\nHail\n-4 Visibilty Penalty.\nEvery 20 IC you've been in combat in the open, you take a Minor Blunt wound.\n\nHeavy Cold\nWater tends to freeze quickly, 1 Gallon being frozen per 20 IC. \n-3 to All Skills.\nEvery time your Chakra penalty increases, it increases by one more.\n\nHeavy Heat\nSuiton require double the amount of water.\nEvery time your Stamina penalty increases, it increases by one more.\n\nHigh Winds\nImmobilization Penalty 2\n+3 Speed on Fuuton for purposes of damage only.\nOn any Ranged Weapon Taijutsu, roll 1d4, on a 1, it misses.\nEvery 20 IC the effects of the E-rank Fuuton Technique Cleansing Wind is used.\n\nHigh Air Pressure\n-3 Speed on Fuuton for purposes of damage only.\nBreathing isn't as easy as normal. You must make a Stamina check every 20 IC with a TN of 5+5*Your current Fatigue level. This CANNOT be combined with Low Air Pressure. Oxygen Mask makes you not have to roll this check. \n\nLow Air Pressure\nFuuton does -20% damage for the purposes of Wounding.\nLow air pressure means air is much &quot;thinner&quot; than normal. Make a Resistance check every 20 IC (or 10 minutes out of combat), TN 10, increased by 5 every time you succeed, to a maximum of 50, or you suffer from a Major Blunt Head wound for the next 20 IC (or 10 minutes out of combat). Rest action can reduce TN by 5, to a minimum of 5. This CANNOT be combined with High Air Pressure. Oxygen Mask makes you not have to roll this check. \n\nClear Skies\nNot a single cloud in sight, or maybe a few small ones. No penalties or bonuses!\n\n\nExtreme Weather: \nWarning, being in these conditions can not only be dangerous to your health, you could very well die.\n\nSmog\nThis has the effects of Fog and Low Air Pressure.\nEvery 20 IC you suffer from Suffocation 1 (Oxygen mask prevents further Suffocation stacks, and removes 1 Stack every 2 IC you spend wearing the mask). This caps at 5.\n\nStorm\nThis has the effects of High Winds and Heavy Rain.\nYou lose Enhanced Hearing and Blind Fighting bonuses, and Offensive genjutsu have a -3 Penalty.\nIf you wield a metallic weapon during a Storm, you roll a 1d100 every 10 IC. If you roll a 1-5, you are struck by a bolt of lightning! Defend against an Accuracy 80 Tenchu with an NDB of 30!\n\nSandstorm\nThis has the effects of High Winds and Heavy Heat.\nEvery 20 IC you suffer from Burns 1, which escalates by 1 every 20 IC. If you have more than DR 10 this doesn't effect you.\n-8 Visibility Penalty and every 5 IC you suffer from Suffocation 1. This caps at 5. Oxygen Mask makes you immune to these effects.\nEvery 10 IC you don't move your Immobilization penalty increases by 1. This additional penalty can be lowered by 1 by moving 3 yards. If this makes your Immobilization 10 or more, your Suffocation penalty from Sandstorm is uncapped.\nEvery 20 IC you've been in combat in the open, you take a Minor Slashing wound.\n\nBlizzard\nNow, you wish you didn't mention that Touu's mother.\nThis has the effects of High Winds and Heavy Cold.\n-6 Visibility Penalty.\nParalysis 2 Always, unless you have Watershoes or Waterwalking. Then it's Paralysis 1.\nEvery 20 IC you've been in combat in the open, you take a Minor Piercing wound.\n\\page\n\n\n\n===========================================\n# Day and Night: \n\n## Daytime\n- The sun is high in the sky.

Stamina\n2. Chakra Exhaustion\n3. Fatigue\n4. Example\n\n====================\n1. Stamina\n------------------------------\n\nPeople get tired; it just happens, even to supernaturally-empowered ninja. To represent this, certain attacks have a stamina cost, listed in a format such as &quot;Stamina: 10.&quot;\n\nWhenever you use a move with a listed Stamina cost, you make a stamina roll: 1d20+RES/10. Regardless of the result, your attack is resolved normally. However, if you got less than the TN for your roll (that is, the move's Stamina rating) your Fatigue is raised by one category.\n\nRealistically, continued exertion even at the same level will tire people out. Every time you make a stamina roll, you incur a penalty equal to (the Stamina cost)/5, rounded down, on all future Stamina rolls you make.\n\nThis penalty is reset to 0 every time you advance a Fatigue category, and at the end of battle. It can also be reduced by spending your time Resting in combat.\n\n====================\n2. Chakra Exhaustion\n------------------------------\n\nThe counterpart to stamina. Shinobi have the ability to use all manner of fantastic abilities by drawing on the chakra within themselves and manipulating the environment. While very potent, this energy comes from their body, and it's easy for a shinobi, especially an inexperienced one, to overtax themselves.\n\nNinjutsu and genjutsu moves have a chakra cost, listed in a form such as &quot;Chakra: 10.&quot; When you use these moves, you make a roll against Chakra Exhaustion; to pass, you must get equal to or greater than the technique's cost on a roll of 1d20+CHA/10. If you fail, your Fatigue is raised one category. Whether you pass or fail, your jutsu works normally.\n\nThe more chakra a shinobi spends, the more strain they put on their body. Whenever you make a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you incur a penalty equal to (the technique's Chakra cost)/5, rounded down, on all future Chakra Exhaustion rolls you make.\n\nThis penalty is reset to 0 every time your Fatigue category increases, and at the end of battle.\n\n====================\n3. Fatigue\n------------------------------\n\nFatigue represents the effects of weariness on your body. Shinobi can push themselves well beyond normal human capabilities, often displaying determination that exceeds their body's limits.\n\nYou begin a battle at Fatigue 0. Whenever you fail a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll, your Fatigue increments up one category, and your penalties to both those rolls reset to 0.\n\nFor every 15 points you fail a roll by, you automatically advance an additional Fatigue category; thus, rolling a 12 on a Stamina 45 technique would cause you to advance 1+(45-12)/15 = 3 Fatigue categories.\n\nFor each level of Fatigue, you apply the following effects:\n-1 to your Accuracy, offensive rolls, and skill rolls\n-2 to your defensive rolls\n+5 to your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls\n\nFatigue only goes up to 5. If you fail a Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina roll when at Fatigue 5, you complete your action and then fall unconscious, your body pushed beyond its limits.\n\nOne exception to that last paragraph, though. If you fail a technique badly enough that you would advance a Fatigue level beyond unconsciousness, the technique you were using fails to activate. Thus, say you're at Fatigue 4, and you fail a technique by 32 points. Failing it advances you to Fatigue 5; the first 15 points you fail it by advances you a second Fatigue category, placing you unconscious; however, you failed by another 15 points, and so not only are you unconscious, but your technique also fails to activate.\n\n====================\n4. Example\n------------------------------\n\nNaruto and Sasuke are fighting over who shall be Sakura's boyfriend. \n\nSasuke starts accosting his nemesis with multiple Shishio Rendan attacks, a Stamina 15 technique. The first, he rolls a plain 1d20+7, with a total of 16, narrowly avoiding failure. Still, he's angry, and he keeps going. The next roll is 1d20+7-3; and, the next, 1d20+7-6. Both times he passes.\n\nNot wanting to exhaust himself too quickly, Sasuke switches to his ninjutsu, tossing off a Grand Fireball, a ninjutsu with a Chakra cost of 16. He rolls his 1d20+6, and passes the roll. He follows that with a Housenka (Chakra cost 14), rolls 1d20+6-3 for Chakra Exhaustion, and again passes his check.\n\nAt this point, Sasuke's next Stamina check will have a -9 penalty, and his next Chakra Exhaustion roll will have a -5 penalty.\n\nDeciding that he'll probably fail his next roll regardless, he attacks with an impressive Chidori: the move has a Chakra Cost of 25, meaning there's no way he can pass its Chakra Exhaustion check. As expected, Sasuke fails, and advances to Fatigue 1.\n\nAt this point, his Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls both have their penalty reset to 0, and since he's Fatigued, those rolls also have a +5 bonus. He considers following immediately with another Chidori (he'd have a small chance of avoiding failure; a roll of 14 or better, 14+6+5=25, would be sufficient), but instead decides to pace himself.</>\n\n\\page\n# Wounds\n\n>1. Explanation\n2. Wound Categories\n3. Damage Types\n4. Location\n5. Called Shots\n\n====================\n1. Explanation\n------------------------------\n\nShinobi can, and frequently do, endure beatings that would leave ordinary people as lifeless, mangled pulps--something about the increased flow of chakra and physical conditioning giving them unnatural durability.\n\nEnough of a beating, over a long enough period of time, will still bring a ninja down, but little things like getting knocked off a roof or stabbed with a knife are not nearly so fatal as they'd be for normal people.\n\nEven so, some blows are too much to just shrug off. These are called wounds, injuries that have some lasting effect on your ability to fight.\n\n====================\n2. Wound Categories\n------------------------------\n\nWounds are divided into four categories, based on their severity: Minor, Major, Severe, and Critical.\n\nSimply put, you acquire wounds by taking too much damage at once. When a single source of damage deals more than a certain percent of your maximum Vitality at once, you suffer a wound of the corresponding severity.\nMinor: 10%\nMajor: 25%\nSevere: 50%\nCritical: 75%\n\nDamage dealt to your HP wounds you based on your maximum HP, as should make sense! However, the percentages are higher, to offset HP being much lower than Vitality\nMinor: 25%\nMajor: 50%\nSevere: 75%\n\nFor the sake of demonstration, we'll say that you have 600 Vitality, and 200 HP. An attack hits you for 100 damage. If you take this damage to your vitality (16%), you suffer one Minor wound. If you take it to your HP (50%), you'd instead suffer a Major wound.\n\nOn the other hand, if you had 60 Vitality remaining when that same attack hit, you'd lose 60 Vitality (10%) and 40 HP (25%), resulting in two Minor wounds.\n\n====================\n3. Damage Types\n------------------------------\n\nAfter determining the severity of a wound, the next (fairly simple!) step is determining what type of wound it is. Being cut by a sword and being hit by a magical ninja fireball, even if they do the same amount of damage, have significantly different effects on the human body.\n\nFor the most part this is self-explanatory, with only four damage types recognized: Blunt, Slashing, Piercing, and Energy.\n\nUnarmed attacks are always blunt damage, nice and simple.\n\nWeapons have their damage type, or types, listed in their descriptions. If a weapon can do multiple types of damage, the attacker declares which type of wound they'll be inflicting after the severity is confirmed, but before the location is determined. Some weapon jutsu require a weapon of a specific damage type to be used; in this case, damage from that jutsu is considered to be of that type.\n\nNinjutsu are simpler than weapons! \nKaton and Raiton jutsu inflict energy damage.\nDoton and Suiton inflict blunt damage.\nFuuton inflicts slashing damage.\nAn exception! Some jutsu augment a weapon strike, or actually create a weapon. In these cases, use the damage type of that weapon, not the element it was made from.\n\n====================\n4. Location\n------------------------------\n\nAfter determining severity and damage type, you roll to determine location--where you hit, and what you injured. It's all well and good to say you threw a punch at their face, but this is battle, with ninjas! Things rarely go as planned.\n\nYou roll a percentile die (1d100) for location, and check the relevant damage type's wound list, under the appropriate severity, to determine the effect. If it's an arm or leg that's been wounded, odds on the 1d100 are the right arm, and evens the left.\n\nThis all gets simpler if the defender is blocking; in that case, they choose the location.\n\nMultiple wounds, even multiples of the same effect, stack. Two broken left arms means that your arm is broken twice, with double the normal penalties.\n\nOne exception. If you suffer a critical wound, it overrides all lesser wounds on that location--having an arm reduced to useless deadweight makes the fact that it's broken in six places kind of, well, irrelevant. Two criticals in the same place, however, is oh so very possible.\n\n====================\n5. Called Shots\n------------------------------\n\nNormally, when you attack your only real goal is hitting the enemy as hard as possible--you might plan on aiming a punch at their stomach, but if they duck down you're not going to be picky: you'll sock them square between the eyes.\n\nA called shot is an attack specifically targeting a certain location. After checking your attack's damage type, choose any of the locations which can be Wounded by damage of that type. You declare that when you make your attack, for example, &quot;Hinotama, Called Shot: Arm&quot;.\n\nThe attack has a -4 Accuracy penalty. However, if it hits any wounds it inflicts will automatically be dealt to that location.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n### Blunt (Minor)\n   \n   (1 - 20) Ringing Noise (Head)\no/~ There's a drumming noise inside my head that starts when... o/~ ... uh, right. But, yeah, it's pretty distracting. This gives a -1 penalty to all d20 rolls, aside from Genjutsu defenses; it's -2 for them.\n\n\n   (21 - 40) Bruised Ribs (Torso)\nAs in the bones, not the skin over them. Truth is, ribs hurt a lot more than they have any business doing. Breathing hurts in particular, deep breathing especially so. This increases the Speed of all your actions by 1, similar to Paralysis. You'll recover from this at the end of the week.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Winded (Abdomen)\nA good shot to the gut hit your solar plexus or compressed your diaphragm, or both, knocking the wind out of you. You'll be fine, definitely, but this increases your Stamina penalty by 4 and applies a Stun 4.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Bruised (Arm)\nYour arm is bruised. It hurts. This gives a -1 Accuracy penalty (because of the pain being distracting, if you're attacking without using the arm) and increases your Seal Speeds by 1.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Bruised (Leg)\nSomething hit your leg and now it hurts! You'll feel better after you walk it off (or just sit down and let the pain fade). Until the end of battle this reduces your base movement speed by 10% and applies a -1 penalty to dodge rolls.</text>\n\n### Blunt (Major)\n   \n   (1 - 20) Dazed (Head)\nThat one left you reeling. Once you're done seeing stars, you'll be... mostly okay. You lose any AP you currently have, and all effects with Upkeeps (other than doujutsu) end as you lose your concentration. If you're standing on water or a wall, you'll fall, too.\n\nEverything seems just a little bit... off, about the world, though you can't quite place what. Sounds are muffled, colors muted, and things keep moving at the edge of your vision. This distraction provides a -3 penalty to all skill checks and defensive genjutsu rolls. It lasts for two weeks.\n\n\n   (21 - 40) Collapsed Lung (Torso)\nYour lung quit its day job; unfortuantely, that day job was letting you breathe. Your Fatigue rolls have a -4 penalty; you can live with both lungs collapsed, though that raises the penalty to -12 (rather than just -8).\n\nIt takes only a week of medical treatment to get over this, but it won't get better without that treatment.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Groin Shot (Abdomen)\nIf this was a called shot, you should probably having a serious talk with your opponent about what constitutes fair fighting. Even ninja have standards!\n\nIt's a Stun 7, and you probably feel more than a little nauseous. Don't be ashamed about doubling over and whimpering, either! Until it's healed (2 weeks for that, 4 without rest) your Agility stat is considered 25% lower for determining how fast you can move. On top of that, you have a -3 penalty to Resistance rolls until your recovery's complete.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Sprained Arm (Arm)\nYour elbow or wrist was forced to bend in a way it's not meant to by the blow, and sprained in the process. This gives a -4 penalty to rolls, and Accuracy of attacks, using that arm (such as grapple checks, and all two handed weapons). Single-handed weapons held in the other hand, ninjutsu, and taijutsu jutsu which specify they're only kicks suffer only a -2.\n\nIt also increases your Seal Speeds by 5. It takes four weeks to recover. Weeks in which you use that arm in combat don't count towards the recovery time.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Sprained Leg (Leg)\nThe muscles and ligaments in your knee or ankle were stretched beyond their capacity. Any time you move, including dodging, the pain leaves your Accuracy and d20 rolls at a -4 penalty for the next 15 IC.\n\nIt takes a month for the sprain to heal, or twice that long without rest.</text>\n\n### Blunt (Severe)\n   (1 - 20) Concussion (Head)\nSomebody turned out the lights. It is very dark, and you are likely to be eaten by a grue. Thankfully, you get over that before your enemies can capitalize on it (or you're eaten).\n\nThis imposes a -5 penalty on all d20 rolls, and halves (round down) the amount of AP you gain. Whenever you suffer a head wound, you have a 10% chance per level of the wound to be knocked unconscious. Any time this happens, your recovery time is reset.\n\nIt takes six weeks of rest to recover from a concussion, or twelve weeks without rest. Medical treatment won't help it get better any faster.\n\n\n   (21 - 40) Broken Ribs\nYou are in horrible, terrible pain. You'd be screaming and/or mewling, if you weren't a ninja! Breathing feels like you're being stabbed--and depending on how badly broken those ribs are, that might be exactly what's happening.\n\nThe effectiveness of blocking is reduced by 25% (from 50% to 25% for most attacks, and 25% to ineffective against weapons), and you have a -4 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls. The Speed of all actions you take is increased by 2.\n\nBlocking's effectiveness is restored by 5% for every two weeks of rest you have. Once you've fully recovered from that penalty, the penalties to Accuracy, rolls, and Speed also disappear.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Crushed Organ (Abdomen)\nIt's not as bad as it sounds, honestly. There's some severe bleeding and bruising inside the organ itself, and it hurts horrendously, but it's not bleeding out into other parts of your body--meaning it can only possibly get so bad. Your max HP and Vitality are reduced by 10% (and your current values of both by 10% of your maximum), and you have a -5 penalty to Resistance rolls.\n\nThe reduction is lowered by 1% per week of rest you have, and the Resistance penalty by 1 per 2 weeks of rest.\n\n\\page\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Broken Arm (Arm)\nYour arm can't be used in grapples, and you have a -5 penalty to all grapple rolls. It can't be used to hold two-handed weapons, and attempting to use it for any other sort of taijutsu (unarmed or weapon) incurs a -5 Accuracy penalty and denies you your damage bonus for that action.\n\nYou can still form handseals, though when you finish doing so make a Resistance roll with a -10 penalty against the base Seal Speed; failure means you flinch, and while you get your jutsu off just fine you inflict yourself with a Stun 12.\n\nTwo months of not using the arm will be sufficient for it to heal.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Broken Leg (Leg)\nSevere damage to your leg has left you with a reduced ability to locomote around the battlefield! If worst comes to worst, you can still power-hobble on it; it doesn't directly penalize your movement, but moving has a Stun 4 added to it (even moving as part of an attack).\n\nSo long as your leg is broken, you can't use any jutsu or abilities that increase your movement speed.\n\nYour leg won't get better if you're walking around on it. If you walk with crutches (or a cane, or something of the sort) you can move at only half speed, but it counts as 'rest' for the purpose of recovering from this wound, which takes a total of two months. Each time you opt to run around unaided on it extends the remaining recovering time by a week.</text>\n\n### Blunt (Critical)\n   (1 - 20) Fractured Skull (Head)\nYou got hit in the head hard enough that you're lucky you don't have (much) brain damage. This will usually be accompanied by nasty lacerations and prolific bleeding, but not always.\n\nAside from a Stun 15, you suffer a -5 penalty to accuracy and all d20 rolls, doubled for skill checks.\n\nThis takes 4 OOC weeks to fully heal. Any time in that period that you suffer a Head Wound, of any type or severity, roll 1d20. On 1 - 10, you suffer the wound normally. On a roll of 11 - 20, you're unconscious and comatose until that wound fully heals (even if that takes longer than it does for your Fractured Skull to finish healing). You'll always be comatose for a minimum of 24 hours, even for a Minor head wound.\n\n\n   (21 - 40) Sternal Fracture (Torso)\nYour sternum is that rather lengthy, thoroughly sturdy piece of bone and cartiliage that runs down the middle of your chest that all your ribs connect to. They're pretty hard to break. Nice job pulling that one off.\n\nThis in itself isn't terribly bad, but whatever hit you with enough force to do that off also managed to break several ribs and cause some significant internal damage. It's pretty easy to tell your chest is just about ruined: there's a grinding nose of bone on bone whenever you breathe or try to move too much, for one thing; the agonizing pain's a pretty good hint, too.\n\nThis imposes a -15 penalty on all Stamina checks, and reduces your damage bonuses by half. It also imposes a -5 penalty on all defensive rolls.\n\nEvery two weeks of rest reduces the Stamina penalty by 1. Once that penalty reaches -10, your damage bonuses return to normal. Once it reaches -5, your defensive actions stop being penalized.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Rupture (Abdomen)\nYour abdomen's important because it's full of all sorts of squishy parts that are pretty important for your continued survival. Whatevr kind of trauma you just went through ruptured one of those squishy bits, and now it's bleeding out all over your insides. Yes, blood belongs inside you, but... not actually inside your abdominal cavity.\n\nEvery time you act, including movement, you lose HP (not Vitality) equal to the Speed of the action, and an addtional 1 HP every 5 IC. In theory, this could even Wound you again.\n\nTreating this with First Aid requires a Medicine skill of at least 10, and generally involves cutting open the victim's abdomen and letting it drain (or, in rare cases, ventilate) before figuring out what's actually bleeding and making it stop. It's a Speed 25 action to treat this Wound, but it stops the persistent HP loss.\n\nAny time you take an action, you have a 5*(action's Sped)% chance of causing the injury to act up again, bringing back all its lovely effects and requiring treatment (via First Aid or actual medical treatment) to bring it back under control again. Every four consecutive weeks you go without incurring this effect, the multiplier is reduced by 1.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Shattered Arm (Arm)\nYou arm is so broken that the breaks have breaks. It's useless. You can't perform handseals, hold weapons or use items with it, and so forth. The pain is horrible and makes it virtually impossible to concentrate, imposing a -6 penalty to d20 rolls and Accuracy, and a -4 penalty to Fatigue checks.\n\nAfter four weeks of medical treatment, the pain will be manageable, and the penalties will be reduced to a mere -3 Accuracy (though you still can't use the arm). Only after that will it begin to actually heal, which takes a total of twenty weeks, or thirty without medical treatment.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Shattered Leg (Leg)\nThere are broken legs, there are severely broken legs, and then there's your leg. You can't stand without something to prop you up, but because you're a tough-as-nails and super-resourceful ninja you can still move, though the distance you move is divided by 4. You have a -8 penalty to dodge, and -4 to other d20 rolls.\n\nOnce you've had two weeks of medical treatment and been put in a splint, you can walk So long as you carry a crutch, cane, or walking stick (which does occupy a hand), you can move at half speed, and suffer only halve the above penalties. You can do so without out, though each time you take any action which requires you to move (including dodging), or are hit, you have a 50% chance of your leg giving out, and suffering all the regular penalties.\n\nOnce you've received treatment, it takes 30 OOC days to heal, half when receiving full-time medical treatment.</text>\n\n### Slashing (Minor)\n   (1 - 20) Blood in Eyes (Head)\nOh no you're bleeding from the face. Because fights msut be dramatic, the attack has cut in such as way (maybe right across your eyelid, maybe over the forehead) that blood is now dripping into your eyes, causing a continual distraction. This imposes a -2 visibility penalty. You can wipe the blood from your eyes, a Speed 3 action, which removes that penalty for the next 10 IC.\n\n\\page\n\n   (21 - 40) Armor Tear (Torso)\nSomething managed to slice right across your chest, hacking your armor right off your body.  On top of being a fairly nasty gash which is likely to scar if not given stitches, you have a Bleed 4 effect, and any armor you're wearing is removed (But clothing is still there!). Armor which specifically applies to only a different location (such as your head) is not lost.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Sliced Stomach (Abdomen)\nThis is what happens when you can't make your body concave enough.  You get cut right across the belly.  Fortunately it isn't that bad, it's just in a bad spot.  Your Stamina and Chakra costs are all increased by 2 until the end of the battle.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Lacerated (Arm)\nYou got a nasty gash running along your arm.  It didn't cut anything vital, but blood is seeping down your arm and off your fingertips.  All Seal Speeds are made at +2 (unless you can do them one-handed, then you can avoid this by using the unwounded arm), and you have a -2 to all grapple checks.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Lacerated (Leg)\nYou got a nasty gash running along your leg.  It's not life-threatening, but it is staining your clothes and oozing down your leg.  You have a -1 immobilization penalty that will fade after 20 IC, but anytime you take a move action (moving as part of an attack action is fine, but using Shunshin is not), the wound will reopen, applying another -1 immobilization penalty with +5 IC in duration.</text>\n\n### Slashing (Major)\n   \n   (1 - 20) Profuse Bleeding (Head)\nYou got a gash on your face, maybe a slice into your cheek. You're bleeding a lot! Head injuries are like that. The blood loss isn't the issue; the fact that that blood is running over your face and getting in your mouth is.\n\nAs your mouth fills with blood, it becomes progressively harder to breathe (and not vomit), causing a Suffocation 1 effect every 20 IC. Whenever you Rest, the severity of this Suffocation effect is reduced by 1.\n\nUnfortunately for you, it's amazingly easy to get this kind of wound infected, so it will not heal without medical treatment.  With medical treatment, it takes three weeks.\n\n\n   (21 - 40) Pulmonary Gash (Chest)\nSomething managed to cut through your pectoral muscle and between your ribs to knick your lung.  A pretty impressive feat, but if they were a real badass they would get your heart (be sure to taunt them about that).\n\nThis inflicts a Bleed effect of 3*Fatigue Level, minimum 3.  Every time their fatigue level increases, they get a Bleed 3 effect--If they were already suffering from this, then the existing bleed is increased by 3.\n\nLuckily it's a deep but narrow injury, so it tends to heal fairly quick.  It takes two weeks to recover from, with or without treatment.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Open Cavity (Abdomen)\nYour abdominal cavity--the part of your body that holds all your abdominal organs in together in a nice, safe environment--has been opened, and it really wasn't meant to be.\n\nYou can no longer Rest.  Your bonus to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls based from Fatigue are is reduced to +3 per Fatigue level (rather than +5).  The penalty you incur from passing a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll is (the action's cost)/4, rather than (the action's cost)/5.\n\nThis takes a month to heal.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Muscle Tear (Arm)\nYour bicep and/or tricep have been partially torn, which tends to make it a lot harder to function effectively in combat, as your arm goes from a dry noodle to a limp one.\n\nYour STR is reduced by 25%.  This affects everything derived from your STR score you're hoping it doesn't (Vitality, Damage Bonus, damage dice with taijutsu, etc).  This heals at a rate of 5% per two weeks without medical attention or rest, or 5% per week in a hospital.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Muscle Tear (Leg)\nYour quadriceps have been torn.  Not to fear, the tendon is fine and you haven't been hamstrung, you're not going to be put down like an animal (though this should teach you to treat pets better).\n\nOn the other hand, your AGI is reduced by 25%.  This affects everything derived from your AGI score you're hoping it doesn't (Dodge, Initiative, max AP, movement speed).  This heals at a rate of 5% per two weeks without medical attention or rest, or 5% per week with medical treatment.</text>\n### Slashing (Severe)\n   (1 - 20) Avulsed Ear (Head)\nYou have a nasty cut right across your ear! Not only does this look pretty brutal, but there's blood seeping into your inner ear, which can do some nasty things to your sense of coordination.\n\nIf you have the Enhanced Hearing ability, you lose all benefits from it, as well as any abilities which depend on it (such as Blind Fighting). With blood pooling in the ear making it difficult to keep your sense of balance, the highest level of Taijutsu you can perform is reduced by one (From A  to B, B to C, C to D/etc).\n\nYou're also treated as being on Fatigue category *higher* than you actually are for the purpose of penalties (but not benefits), meaning that if you're at Fatigue 1, you have a -2 to Accuracy and -4 to Defensive rolls, instead of the normal -1/-2.  Under normal circumstances, this means you also fall unconscious at Fatigue 4, instead of Fatigue 5.\n\nThe blood can be drained from the ear easily with medical attention, but can't be treated in battle.  It will heal on its own (and probably scar) in eight weeks, or four weeks (and probably not scar) if you have medical attention.\n\n\\page\n\n   (21 - 40) Clavicle Cut (Torso)\nThe horizontal bone that connects your sternum to your scapula has been fractured.  More than likely, it's possible you can even feel part of the bone that's jutting out from the skin, if you try to look down at it.\n\nThe worst part of it is the pain, which can't really be avoided because of how the clavicle helps the scapula keep in position to let the arm hang. This inflicts a -2 to Accuracy and d20 rolls, and a Paralysis 4.  Any time you perform an action with a Stamina cost, you take twice that amount in damage, which bypasses reductions (such as DR).\n\nCrash course in anatomy, you have two clavicles. If the result was odd, it's your right; even, your left. With proper medical attention (a trip to a doctor, or a Medicine roll of 20 or higher using a First Aid kit, you or someone else) you can get the arm completely immobilized against your body. This reduces the Paralysis to 2, and halves the damage taken when you make Stamina rolls, but means you cannot use that arm or hand at all.\n\nIt takes 6 weeks to heal, with or without medical treatment.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Chopped Liver (Abdomen)\nYour liver has been cut.  There's really no good side to this one, it pretty much sucks.  The liver happens to have quite a few functions, namely helping against toxins and the digestion of proteins.  It's kind of vital to live, and it happens to be bleeding out at a very significant rate.\n\nThis applies a Bleed 10 effect. Whenever you take an action with a Speed greater than the severity of your current Bleed from this wound (even if it's gone down to Bleed 0), that Bleed's severity increases by 2.\n\nThis also impedes your body's ability to process chemicals properly. If you're under the effects of a Soldier or Blood Pill, they end immediately (including the reduction of a Fatigue level, which can knock you unconscious). Taking either pill with this wound results in no beneficial effect taking place. The Akimichi clan's pills still work normally.\n\nThis takes ten weeks to recover from, down to five with medical attention.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Hand of Benediction (Arm)\nNo, the name's not a joke, and I have no idea why you think it would be. It's a real term!\n\nSomehow, the median nerve around the elbow has been severed, resulting in a loss of proper hand function.  It doesn't hurt that much since it was a nerve that was struck, but your pinky and ring fingers are no longer able to be felt or manipulated at all, and your thumb is more or less unopposable.  \n\nFor starters, if you had anything in your hand at the time (evens for left, odds for right), you're automatically disarmed.  The same is true for any two-handed weapon you might be holding.  You can not wield a weapon in that hand, and any unarmed attacks made with the affected limb do not receive your damage bonus.\n\nYour DEX bonus to Accuracy is now DEX/20 and Seal Speeds are increased by 50%, before any reductions are applied to them (such as uniques, DEX/10, etc).  You can avoid the increase in Seal Speed by performing your seals one-handed, using the opposite hand--if you're able to do so.\n\nThis will not heal without treatment:  Nerves are tricky things which require medical ninjutsu to properly restore.  With medical attention, it takes seven weeks to heal.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Hamstrung (Leg)\nOne of the major tendons of the leg, located behind the femur, have been cut.  You're now unable to walk or stand properly, more or less, and running is completely out of the equation.\n\nYou're automatically prone, as if tripped (See the E-rank Taijutsu for its penalties), and your AGI bonus to Dodge is now AGI/20.  Even when you get up, your movement speed is cut in half, and you can no longer move as part of an attack.  You can still use jutsu to increase your rate of movement, but the total distance moved is halved.\n\nYou gain AGI/20 AP, instead of normal, and your AP cap is now AGI/4. Any Athletics rolls you make use only half of your total ranks in the skill.\n\nIf you manage to survive the fight which caused this (props for that, since you're a sitting duck), it takes twelve weeks to recover from, or six with medical attention.</text>\n### Slashing (Critical)\n   (1 - 20) Cut Throat (Head)\nThe good news: you were not beheaded.  The bad news: They didn't fail by much.  Your carotid artery was hit, along with your trachea, which means blood is flying all over the place and you're going to suffocate from it if you don't do something smart (like surrender, or run away).\n\nYou start with a Suffocation 2. Every time you take an action with a Speed greater than 0, its severity is increased by 1 (notably, the &quot;Move&quot; action will not trigger this effect). However, instead of making a Stamina 15 roll every time your Suffocation increases (as you would with a normal Suffocation status), you make such a roll every 10 IC. This follows all other normal rules for Suffocation.\n\nAdditionally, you suffer a Bleed status with severity equal to that of the Suffocation. In the case of special abilities which reduce the effect of the Suffocation status on you, the Bleed's severity is determined before they're applied.\n\nTreatment with a First Aid kit will set the Suffocation penalty to 0; however, this will not prevent it from increasing again. In fact, nothing will at all until you've recovered from the wound! Ouch. On the bright side, you're a super-implausible magic ninja. If you carefully apply pressure to your neck with both hands, you can temporarily suspend both the Suffocation rolls and the Bleed damage--though you may take no other actions while doing this, not even Speed 0 ones. This 'suspension' applies after you've been doing it for at least 10 consecutive IC.\n\nThis is really just nasty business, all things considered. It won't start healing until it's received some medical treatment; after that, as long as you keep your neck bandaged and let yourself rest, it'll take twenty-six weeks to heal. Time to spend in a hospital counts double for this purpose.\n\n\\page\n\n   (21 - 40) Injured Spine (Torso)\nIn simple terms, your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system and relays signals from the body to the brain, and vice versa.  It also has several neural circuits which control numerous reflexes and &quot;instinctual&quot; actions that ninja tend to train themselves for (like moving out of the way of the technique that caused this). \n\nFortunately for you, your reflexes didn't seem to be that crucial anyway, since you let this happen, so you probably aren't that bad off.  Well, that's a lie.  Whenever you take an action with a Speed greater than (RES)/10, two things happen.\n\nThe first is that you suffer a Stun of half its Speed. The second is that you acquire a Paralysis 1 status, or increase your existing Paralysis from this wound by 1. The Paralysis lasts until the end of the battle.\n\nThis will not heal without medical treatement.  It will take thirteen weeks of medical treatment to recover from this.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Disemboweled (Abdomen)\nCongratulations, you've got what is potentially the most terible injury one can receive.  Your abdomen is full of all kinds of squishy organs and things which, as it turns out, are pretty important to keep you alive.  Now there's a giant cut across your midriff and they're all trying to sag out of your body.\n\nYour Fatigue penalties are doubled (-2 to Accuracy and -4 to defensive rolls per level), but the bonuses are not. Any jutsu with an Upkeep cannot be used, as it's impossible to maintain the necessary level of focus.\n\nUntil you've received treatment for this, any called shots to your abdomen automatically deal their damage to your Hit Points.\n\nIt takes a total of twenty-four weeks of rest to recover from this. Every time you advance a Fatigue level after receiving this wound, it takes another week to recover from. The wound won't even begin to heal until you've received some form of medical treatment (be it from a first aid kit or a week in the hospital). Weeks in the hospital count double towards your recovery.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Avulsed Arm (Arm)\nSomething just cut through a good portion of your arm.  It's still connected, but it's kind of flopping, and you can't really control it, and it's kind of bleeding everywhere, and.. Yeah.\n\nFirstly, the arm is useless, which means you can't hold weapons (any you are, drop), make handseals, use items and so forth.  You have a Bleed 6, -8 to Accuracy, and -4 to defensive rolls.  Every time you perform an attack which deals damage, your Bleed status from this wound increases by your DB/5, to a minimum of 1--if it's down to 0, then you acquire a brand new one!\n\nThe arm will heal on its own so long as you keep it placed properly (any first aid kit will do for this) in a sling, reducing the penalty to Acuracy and defensive rolls by 1 per five weeks, with time in a hospital counting double. Once those penalties are gone entirely, you will stop incurring Bleed effects when you attack. \n\n\n   (81 - 100) Achilles Tendon Cut (Leg)\nNamed after a mythic, nigh-invincible man who supposedly had a single tendon as his weak spot.  As it turns out, that's actually a weak spot of everybody, and yours just got cut.\n\nThe pain isn't quite as bad as the sight of your foot dragging along unresponsively.  For starters, you're unable to really stand properly, so you take a -8 to your Dodge rolls, and a -4 to Accuracy and Athletics.\n\nThe worst part is that you really just can't move.  You can't move as part of an attack or use jutsu that affect movement (like Shunshin).  You can still take a move action, but at that point you're moreso just rolling and crawling, so the total distance moved is divided by 4, after all other factors are applied to it.  You can still 'move' to get out of the way of Area of Effect attacks, but it suffers the same /4 as regular movement.\n\nThis simply won't heal without medical attention.  With it, you reduce the Dodge penalty every two weeks and the Accuracy and penalty to d20 rolls every four weeks.  Additionally, after eight weeks the penalty to movement becomes /2. After the the full sixteen week recovery time has passed, the movement penalty goes away.</text>\n\n### Piercing (Minor)\nFor every Minor piercing wound you're suffering from, you reduce your current an maximum action Points by 2, to a minimum of 0. This stacks addiively with all other AP reductions, including multiples of the same wounds.\n\nEven if a minor wound has a timed effect, the AP reduction portion of the wound lasts until the end of the battle. Wounds that are healed mid-battle similarly have their AP reduction removed (and it is possible to heal a Minor wound whose main effect has ended, but AP reduction remains).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   (1 - 30) Needling (Torso)\nYou've got a small but fairly deep incision from what struck you.  The initial shock of pain was worse than the wound really is, though.  You take a Stun 3, which increases by 1 for every time you take this wound in the same battle.\n\n\n   (31 - 60) Flesh Wound (Abdomen)\nYou've been shanked in the gut.  It managed to miss your vitals, but it's still going to cause blood to trickle out of you.  You take a -1 to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Reflexive Flinch (Arm)\nThe back of your hand was hit, causing your fingers to spasm momentarily.  Any weapons you're holding are dropped, and any seals you're forming are automatically aborted.  You take a -1 to Accuracy for the next 50 IC.\n\nRepeatedly applications of this wound do not stack the penalty to Accuracy, but instead add 50 IC to its duration (or, if it has expired, re-apply it).\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Muscle Stab (Leg)\nThey struck your quadricep, which is a fairly easy target, all things considered.  If you spent the IC before you received this wound moving, you are inflicted with a Stun 8; whether you were moving or not, though, you have a -1 to Defensive rolls for the next 50 IC.\n\nRepeated applications of this wound do not stack the penalty to defensive rolls, but instead add 50 IC to its duration (or, if it has expired, re-apply it).</text>\n\\page\n\n### Piercing (Major)\nEvery Major Piercing wound you're suffering from reduces your current and maximum AP by 4. This stacks additively with all other AP reductions, including multiples of the same wounds.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   (1 - 30) Punctured Cavity (Torso)\nThe body has several cavities, areas where spcific internal organs are house and kept together.  One of them has been pierced and now has a hole in it, which is filling up with blood.\n\nIt's painful to move, or do basic things like breathe.  You have a penalty to Fatigue and d20 rolls equal to the number of Torso wounds you have, including this one, up to a maximum of -4.\n\nMultiple instances of this wound count towards raising the penalty, and all lower your AP normally, but their penalties don't stack--that is, if you had five Punctured Cavities, your total penalty would be -4, not -20.\n\nIt takes four weeks to recover from, two with medical attention.\n\n\n   (31 - 60) Organ Hemmorrhage (Abdomen)\nYour abdomen happens to have several internal organs all closely packed together.  While space-saving, it also happens to mean that if you're hit there, one of them is bound to be injured in some form or fashion, and that's exactly what happened.\n\nWhat that boils down to is that you're bleeding, a lot. You take a -1 penalty to Accuracy and defensive rolls, and any time you take an action (including defensive ones) with a Speed higher than your current AP, this wound's penalty increases by 1, to a maximum of -4.\n\nRepeated applications of this wound raise the penalties by 1 each, though still not above -4. These penalties last until the wound has healed.\n\nThis takes two weeks to recover from, only one with medical treatment.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Joint Pierced (Arm)\nOne of your arm's joints has been struck and is now filling with blood and becoming inflamed. It makes it much harder to properly manipulate the appendage, on top of the very strange and unnerving sensation you get when you move the arm and can feel the collected blood sloshing around.\n\nThe base speed of all your attacks is increased by 2, and the effective speed for determining their damage is decreased by 2. Thus, a basic unarmed attack would be changed from Speed 8 to Speed 10, but deal damage as if it was Speed 6.\n\nThe increase and decrease cannot exceed 50% of an action's base speed. For example, after 20 separate applications of this wound your basic unarmed attack would be Speed 12, and deal damage as if it was Speed 4. You may still use AP to reduce these actions to half their new base speed.\n\nIt takes three weeks to recover, only one with medical treatment.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Joint Pierced (Leg)\nThough they missed fracturing your knee cap, they still managed to pierce the joint itself, and it's not collecting (and leaking) blood which isn't supposed to be there.  Like many wounds, on its own it isn't so bad, but when aggravated, it becomes very problematic.\n\nFor every yard you move, including as part of an attack or with the aid of a jutsu, your movement speed afterwards is decreases by 1%, to a maximum of a 50% reduction. Multiple applications of this wound do not increase its maximum reduction; however, if you had two instances of it your speed would be reduced by 2% for every yard you moved thereafter, and so forth.\n\nFinally, this applies a -1 penalty to defensive rolls for every 15% it reduces your movement speed.\n\nIt takes two weeks to recover on its own, only one with medical treatment.</text>\n\n### Piercing (Severe)\nEvery Severe Piercing wound you're suffering from reduces your current and maximum AP by 6. This stacks additively with all other AP reductions, including multiples of the same wounds.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   (1 - 30) Rib Spearing (Torso)\nThe object that struck you did so in such a way as to cause your ribs not just to fracture, but to split entirely.  Both ends are curved inward, making movement, breathing, and life in general very painful.\n\nYou take a -2 to Accuracy, Fatigue, and d20 rolls just for having your ribs broken.  Additionally, every time you advance a fatigue category, or spend Willpower, you take the Minor Piercing wound Needling, which stacks cumulatively with any other Needling wounds taken in the fight, for determining the severity of its stun.\n\nThis takes ten weeks to recover from, five with medical attention.\n\n\n   (31 - 60) Cavitation (Abdomen)\nCavitation is an interesting phenomen typically only created by high velocity projectiles.  Ninja being ninja, of course, means that this could happen with even the most inconspicuous of objects.\n\nWhat Cavitation is, is basically a wave of pressure that forces things--in your case, your internal organs--to shift in location, causing a cavity where there was none.  It results in your organs being crushed, missshapen, tearing, and dislocated.  This is especially problematic for the abdomen, wherein everything is already densely packed.  There is, shall we say, a space issue.\n\nThe end result is that you automatically advance a fatigue category, and the category at which you fall unconscious is reduced by one (from six to five, normally, meaning if you fail a fatigue roll at fatigue 4, you fall unconscious).\n\nThe only good part about this injury is that once your organs are displaced--well, they're displaced.  If you are already suffering from this injury and are unlucky enough to have it happen again, you advance a fatigue category, but the category for unconsciousness is not lowered more than once, regardless of how many times you suffer this wound.\n\nThis takes twelve weeks to recover from on your own, six with medical treatment.\n\n\\page\n\n   (61 - 80) Tricep Tear (Arm)\nThey missed your humerus bone, but managed to pierce right through the tendon that connected a portion of your tricep to it.  As any medically-savvy ninja knows, your tricep is pretty vital for doing things like punching, and holding objects.\n\nIf you're using a weapon, then your damage bonus is halved; unarmed only has its damage bonus reduced by a fourth.  You take a -3 to Accuracy, but against disarm attempts, this increases to -5 (whether you try to parry or dodge it).\n\nTendons are tricky business, and require medical expertise to fix.  Without medical attention, it won't heal; with it, it takes six weeks.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Hamstrung (Leg)\nYour hamstring, or some similarly important muscle in your leg, got cut badly enough that it's not doing its job any more. You can stand, barely, and you can balance, sort of.\n\nYou can only accomplish 15 IC of movement before having to take a Rest action. Movement as part of an attack counts towards this limit. Any effects which require you to channel chakra through your legs (such as standing on walls or water, or jutsu such as Mizutamari) end, and cannot be used until you've healed.\n\nSpeaking of which, healing takes a while; twelve weeks of rest.</text>\n### Piercing (Critical)\nEvery Critical Piercing wound you're suffering from reduces your current and maximum AP by 8. This stacks additively with all other AP reductions, including multiples of the same wounds.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   (1 - 30) Torso: Punctured Lung\nOkay, so, first off, calm down. It's not as bad as it... okay, yeah, it's as bad as it sounds. The good news is, it's not actually lethal. You've still got the other one (...right?) and whatever did this to you probably ventilated the lung, and by extension, the inside of your chest--no air building up in your chest cavity to collapse the other lung.\n\n...Ready for the bad news? Yeah, lungs aren't actually meant to get ventilated. You have difficulty breathing, for one thing. In fact, you can't actually breathe normally, because there's an extra hole in your lung. Still, you're a super awesome ninja, and as long as you have one hand free to cover the wound up, you can still breathe.\n\nYou can't take Rest actions, and the final results of your Stamina rolls are halved. As in, if you have a 12+5+15 = 32, that's actually a 16. Probably less brutal, you have a -5 penalty to your Accuracy and d20 rolls from the agonizing pain, and a -5 penalty to Chakra Exhaustion rolls due to general poor physical condition. Moving any distance forces a roll of Stamina 10, +1 per yard moved; this even applies when moving as part of an attack or with the aid of a jutsu. This can be avoided by moving at one tenth your normal movement speed.\n\nThe 'agonizing pain' bit goes away in a month (or, more likely, you get used to it). It takes three months of medical treatment to recover from the effects. Once it's done, you're good as new.\n\nOh, unless you get your second lung punctured before the first one's healed. Then you just die after 50 IC have passed. Sucks to be to you.\n\n\n   (31 - 60) Abdomen: Pierced Liver\nYou're bleeding from the midsection. And, the blood is black. Every ninja knows at least a little about anatomy, first aid, and injuries, and everyone ninja knows what black blood means: you're bleeding from the liver and about to die.\n\nThis inflicts you with a Poison 1 effect. 20 IC later, it becomes Poison 2; another 20 IC, and it becomes Poison 3. This continues, all the way up to Poison 10. It doesn't end.\n\nIf treated with First Aid, make a Medicine check. Its effects will be held at bay for 1 hour per point you get on your skill roll. Once you've received a week of medical treatment, this stops being necessary.\n\nHowever, any time you advance a Fatigue level you have an 80% chance of reopening the wound. This goes down by 10% for every month (4 OOC days) that pass without it courring.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Arm: Shoulder Orifice\nSomeone has created another orifice in your body.  As in--if there wasn't blood pouring out from both ends--someone could look right through your shoulder and see what's out the other side.  In Pain is an understatement.\n\nOn top of that, your arm is pretty much worthless.  It's still there, muscular (or toned, for the ladies!) and attached and awesome, but it's not doing anything but helping to keep your clothing on, at this point.  You're not really able to feel anything that the arm or hand happens to touch, and the only way you get it to do so is by flopping it against something as dead weight.\n\nYou lose the usage of your arm.  If you don't have single-handed seals, you can not make seals anymore. You have a -6 Accuracy penalty, can't use two-handed weapons, and when you multi-throw the total number of weapons you can throw is halved.\n\nWhen you're first hit, this inflicts a Bleed 15 which will go away normally.\n\nThis won't even begin healing until you've had four weeks of medical treatment. After that, it'll take another six weeks of medical treatment, or twice as long resting the arm (you may fight and such, as long as you don't use that arm) for it to heal fully.\n\n\\page\n\n   (81 - 100) Leg:  Penetrated Artery\nYour femoral artery has been hit, and blood is literally spraying out of you into the air. Aside from the general pain involved and the fact that it's completely disgusting, you're losing a potentially fatal amount of blood and if it isn't stopped--no, a hand and some pressure won't stop this--you're going to die.\n\nYour maximum Vitality is reduced by 10%. Every time you take an action, your current and maximum Vitality are reduced by (that action's base Speed)*2; every time you spend AP, your current and maximum Vitality are reduced by (AP spent).\n\nIf you have 0 Vitality remaining, your current HP, maximum HP, and maximum Vitality are all reduced by that amount. This includes move actions, unless you move at only one tenth your normal speed. If your maximum Hit Points are reduced to 0, you die.\n\nRecovery takes sixteen weeks. At that point, you begin regaining lost maximum HP and Vitality. Every week which passes you regain (RES)/3 max HP, or (RES)/2 with medical attention. Once your max HP is fully restored, you begin gaining lost maximum Vitality at the same rate.</text>\n### Energy (Minor)\n   (1 - 20) Sun Spots (Head)\nYou were a little too slow in closing your eyes when hit, and now vague shapes resembling the oncoming blast seem to float around in front of you, obscuring your vision.  It's annoying, more than anything else. You have a -4 Visibility Penalty, which fades at a rate of 1 per 10 IC.\n\n   (21 - 40) Flash Fever  (Torso)\nThe center of your body was hit, which is good, since it's intended to take the brunt of attacks.  But whatever hit you also managed to heat you up so much that your body is having trouble regulating your temperature. You feel vaguely sick and tired, but you'll shake it off soon.  You have a -2 to Fatigue rolls until the end of battle.\n\n   (41 - 60) Stomach Blister (Abdomen)\nA pretty nasty blister managed to emerge from whatever hit you, causing plasma to be stuck within a layer of skin that expanded.  It's.. gross, and fairly uncomfortable.  You have a -1 Immobilization penalty until the end of the fight, unless you decide to pop the blister as a Speed 8 action (Seriously--ew), taking a fourth of the damage that caused this injury again.  This additional damage can't cause a wound itself.\n\n   (61 - 80) Burned (Arm)\nYou've been burned!  It hurts.  The skin is red and starting to swell a little, and touching it (or having it touched) tends to hurt, as it's now raw.  This inflicts a Burn 3, and you suffer a -2 to Accuracy until it goes away due to the pain involved with using the affected limb.\n\n   (81 - 100) Burned (Leg)\nYou've been burned!  Seriously, it does hurt.  Your leg is red and it's painful when you put your weight on it trying to do things like run.  You're inflicted with a Burn 3, and take a -2 to Dodges until it goes away due to the pain of using the afffected limb.</text>\n### Energy (Major)\n   (1 - 20) Facial Burn (Head)\nThere's now a nasty burn across your face, the flesh blistered and somewhat charred. This is disorient, and you can't get the smell of burnt flesh out of your nostrils, or the taste out of your mouth, when you inhale, which has the effect of nauseating you whenever you try to breathe deeply.\n\nAs you exert yourself, you smell it more and more and become progressively sicker.  Every time you make a Stamina or Chakra roll, you increase your penalty to both by 2.  This takes a month to heal on your own, or two weeks with medical treatment.\n\n\n   (21 - 40) Scorched Chest (Torso)\nThe majority of your body has been burned, taking any hair found on your chest, back, and stomach along with it.  Due to the large surface area that entails, it isn't that deep at any point, but since it covers so much area, it makes it very easy for others to aggravate your injury.\n\nYou take an additional 10% damage when hit, after all normal reductions but before determining if you suffer wounds.  One of the worst parts about it is how it tends to make getting additional wounds that much easier.  This takes two weeks to heal, only one with medical attention.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Scalded Stomach (Abdomen)\nWhatever hit you managed to more or less burn away what covered your midriff and had enough power behind it to significantly heat up your internal organs. This is not good, as your organs can be pretty sensitive about that kind of thing.\n\nYou are afflicted with a Stun 8, and have your current and maximum Hit Points and Vitality reduced by your RES until this has healed, which takes three weeks with or without medical treatment.\n\n\n   (61 - 80) Second Degree Burn (Arm)\nThe majority of your arm is burned.  While not life-threatening, the amount of skin that's been burned is substantial, making it a great deal more painful to use the arm in battle.\n\nWhen you perform handseals, attack or parry, you take twice the base Speed of the action as damage.  In addition, you have a -2 to Accuracy.  This takes 5 weeks to heal on its own, 3 with medical treatment.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Second Degree Burn (Leg)\nOne of your legs has been burned down to the dermis, the layer beneath the epidermis, causing multiple small blisters to form at the surface, which has reddened and toughened considerably.\n\nYou have a -5 Immobilization penalty, along with a Burn 3.  When the Burn status is removed, the Immobilization penalty is reduced to 3.  It takes two weeks per Immobilization penalty on its own, one week with medical treatment.</text>\n\\page\n\n### Energy (Severe)\n   (1 - 20) Blinded (Head)\nYour kept your eyes open a little too long when something was aimed right at your face.  Just like with it being a bad idea to look directly into the sun, it is also a bad plan to stare directly at a superheated jutsu aimed at your head.  Your face as a whole was scalded, but your eyes took the worst of it by looking at it for so long.\n\nYou take a -3 Visibility Penalty, which is reduced by 1 every 10 IC, and a Stun 3.  It is not so bad by itself, until the next time you're hit by a jutsu that inflicts Energy wounds (regardless of whether or not it does, in fact, actually wound you).\n\nWhen that happens, your visibility penalty is increased by 1 per rank of the jutsu (1 for E, 3 for C, etc.), to a maximum of -8. The technique must deal damage to trigger this effect of the wound.\n\nIt takes a long time for your eyes to not be so sensitive, reducing the penalty you incur when blinded by 1 every four weeks--for a total of a 20 week recovery time, to not be blinded by A-rank jutsu. With medical attention, the recovery time is halved.\n\n\n   (21 - 40) Dark Halo (Torso)\nThe name comes from the fact that you've suffered burns of the entire dermis in a solid, unbroken ring around your body.  It is not quite as cool as it sounds--burns of such magnitude can actually cut off circulation to the rest of the body.\n\nIn short, you're going into shock.  At the start, it is not so bad, reducing the bonus to CE/Stm rolls from Fatigue by 1 (from +5 to +4).  Every time your Fatigue increases, however, the bonus lowers by one per level. Thus, if you were at Fatigue 3 when you received this wound, then went up to Fatigue 5 in the same battle, you'd have only +2 to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls per Fatigue category (for a total of +3).\n\nYour Fatigue bonus 'recovers' at the rate of +1 per three weeks of rest. After this, it will take six more weeks, halved with medical treatment, to fully recover from the wound--meaning that the bonus could still be lowered in that time. If this occurs, you have to re-recover from the lost Fatigue bonus, and then you'll pick up where you left off on healing the rest of the wound.\n\n\n   (41 - 60) Side Burns (Abdomen)\nThe sides of your ribcage have been charred and are almost black, hence the name that resembles a much less gruesome-looking hairstyle (though, let's be honest, it's still pretty bad).  Aside from making the definition of your ribcage more obvious, it also makes it harder to breathe.\n\nIt isn't so bad here and there, but that quick, almost gasping inhale taken when you try to spur yourself onward makes you pause and lose your breath, slowing you down when you want to be at your quickest.\n\nWhenever you spend AP in combat, you must first pay an additional amount AP equal to your current Fatigue level, +1. This surcharge does not affect the action's Speed, pay any costs associate with it, or otherwise count in any beneficial manner. It does, however, count againt any penalties or limitations regarding spending AP you may have.\n\nEvery time you spend more than your current Willpower in AP on an action (including the surcharge from this wound), you are afflicted with a Suffocation 1.  This Suffocation penalty persists for the duration of the fight, but resets to 0 after combat.\n\nThe burns are slow to heal, taking sixteen weeks on your own, or eight weeks with medical attention.\n\n\n  (61 - 80) Muscle Melting (Arms)\nNot quite as literal as the name implies, but no less serious an injury--you've been burned so deep that he muscle itself has been affected.  Aside from intense pain, it also weakens the muscle as a substantial section of it has become damaged and useless.\n\nYour damage bonuses (Physical and Ninjutsu) are lowered by 25%, and you have a -1 penalty to Accuracy.  As you continually use the muscles and chakra involved, the heat builds and spreads to worsen the injury, inflicting even more damage to both muscles and tenketsu.\n\nWhenever you deal damage, the Damage Bonus which was used is lowered by 5%, to a minimum of 50% (halving your damage bonus).  When either reaches 50%, your Accuracy is lowered by an additional 1 point, to a maximum of -5.\n\nBut despite the wound, a ninja's body is an amazing machine.  Every two weeks, you recover 5% of each damage bonus.  With medical attention, you recover that every week.  Once both of your damage bonuses are back to normal, the Accuracy penalty goes away, and your bonuses stop decreasing when being used.\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Fused Foot (Leg)\nThe skin of one of your feet (odds right, evens left) has been burned so badly that the toes are more or less a singular section, melted together.  The rest of it isn't much better, but the most pressing issue how it impairs its functions in battle.\n\nYou have a -5 to dodges due to how hard it is to adequately shift your weight and pivot using that leg now.  It actually makes turning into and away from blows more difficult, imposing a -2 penalty to Parries.  This also makes it substantially harder to run effectively, causing you to lose the benefits of any effects which increase your AGI for the sole purpose of movement (such as the Runner ability, or Racing Thunder Technique), and halving your movement speed on top of that.\n\nHow you're going to fix it medically is another matter altogether, one which is very unpleasant to hear about and even worse to experience.  Safe to say you should want medical attention for it, to recover from it after seven weeks.  But if you're crazy (and have a first aid kit to use), you can go without it, though it takes fourteen weeks to do so.</text>\n\\page\n\n### Energy (Critical)\n   (1 - 20) Eye Welded Shut (Head)\nYou got hit in the face by a giant fireball of bolt of lightning, which is basically awful for tons of reasons. Aside from the deep-tissue burns across half your face, the heat was enough to melt the surface of one of your eyelids, fusing it shut.\n\nAny ranks in the Enhanced Sight are lost until you recover, as are any abilities dependant upon it.  That eye is effectively useless, putting you at a -3 visibility penalty as well.\n\nIt gets worse. The movements of your eyes are linked; where one goes, the other follows, meaning that while one of your eyes is slightly damage and basically glued by molten flesh to your eyelid, it's still trying to move around, aggravating the injury further.\n\nEvery 10 IC which pass, you suffer a -1 penalty to Accuracy, Fatigue rolls, and defensive rolls, with a maximum of -10. However, if you close both your eyes this penalty these penalties are reduced by 1 every 20 IC (though be aware that closing both eyes incurs a -10 visibility penalty), to a minimum of half the highest value it's reached (if it got up to -7, closing your eyes couldn't reduced it below -4).\n\nThis heals naturally, with the penalty to Accuracy, et cetra, being lowered by 1 for every 4 weeks that go without it being increased. Once it's been reduced to 0, it takes ten more weeks to recover. If the Accuracy/etc penalty returns during that time, healing your eye is interrupted (with 'progress' retained) until it's back to 0. At this point you stop suffering this wound's effects, but have a semi-permanent -2 visibility penalty.\n\nMedical treatment halves all the above times. After another five weeks spent hospitalized, the 'permanent' -2 visibility penalty will also be removed.\n\n\n   (21 - 40) Atrial Fibrillation (Torso)\nThe burns to your chest are so deep and severe that they're affecting your cardiovascular system.  Specifically, the heart, and the rhythm at which it beats.  Thankfully, this is the less lethal form of fribrillation, as it means your heart is still able to beat properly and pump blood throughout the body, it just does so irregularly.\n\nBut it's still pretty bad, as things like fighting cause your pulse to shoot way up, which increases the workload of your heart and makes it more likely and devastating every time your heart skips a beat.  Every 15 IC, you take a -1 to Accuracy, d20 rolls, and Defensive rolls.  This penalty can be reduced by 1 by taking a Rest action, but if it does then you do not lower your Stamina penalty, as is normal.\n\nBut the more you fight, the worse it gets, and there is only so much even a ninja can do to support themselves while their heart isn't working properly.  This penalty can only be reduced to half its highest amount reached (if it becomes a -5 to Accuracy, d20 rolls and Defensive rolls, you can only reduce it by Resting to -3).\n\nThis penalty does not increase outside of combat, but will continue to affect you every time you fight.  One of the worst problems with this injury is how it is a chronic condition that the body can't fix by itself, once it's happened.  You must receive medical attention to get it fixed, and with it, takes 7 weeks to no longer suffer penalties to d20 rolls.  With another 7 weeks, you don't take penalties to defensive rolls, and then with another 7 you don't take penalties to Accuracy, and any penalty you still had is removed.\n\n\n   ( 41 - 60 ) Slow Roasted (Abdomen)\nWhen something is cooked poorly, the outside tends to burn first, but the inside is typically not that bad.  But when something is really charred, it is not just that the outside blackens and dies, but it ends up encapsulating the interior, preventing the escape of heat.\n\nThat's basically just what happened to you.  So while your skin is flaking from your stomache and looks absolutely horrifying every time you breathe in and out, the real problem is how your innards have been superheated and are unable to effectively cool off. The end result is a constant feeling of sickness that seems impossible to treat.\n\nYou automatically advance one Fatigue level. Penalties to your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustions rolls are not reset to 0 when you advanced a Fatigue level, and you advance an additional Fatigue category for every 10 points you fail a roll by, rather than every 15.\n\nYou can still Rest, but it becomes a Speed 15 action, to which AP still cannot be applied. Out of combat you recover Fatigue levels at the rate of 1 per OOC day (rather than hour), and cannot recover below Fatigue 1. Similarly, you regain one point of Willpower each OOC day, rather than all your Willpower each day.\n\nAfter twenty weeks of recovery, your Fatigue and Chakra Exhaustion penalties reset normally, and you can recover down to Fatigue zero. After another twenty weeks, your recovery times return to normall. It is very, very difficult for your body to come back from this. Medical attention halves these times.\n\n\n   ( 61 - 80 ) Red Right Hand (Arms)\nThe name is something of a misnomer, actually--your hand is black.  You can't feel it, you can't use it.  It's still there, although it's hard to tell how much of it is salvagable at a glance, because it's just that badly charred.\n\nYou lose the usage of a hand.  You can not make seals, hold two-handed weapons and so forth. You take a -8 to Accuracy rolls, and a -4 to Defensive rolls--Parrying suffers the penalty to Accuracy rolls, not Defensive rolls, as is normal.\n\nRecovering from this is about as painful and drawn-out as you'd expect from losing most of your hand.  It takes thirty weeks on its own, fifteen weeks with medical attention.\n\n\\page\n\n\n   (81 - 100) Melted Leg (Legs)\nYour clothing and leg were both burnt so horridly that it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. Much to your displeasure, you can still feel the limb--or, rather, the mass of agonizing pain where your functional leg used to be. When you move, bits of black flake off--probably best not to think about whether or not that's clothing or flesh.\n\nThis reduces Agility for by 75% the purposes of movement, and prevents you from using movement-enhancing jutsu such as Shunshin or Racing Thunder Technique (the Doton Mud Wave Technique can still be used normally, as it doesn't rely on actual use of your legs).\n\nAdditionally, it's incredibly hard to get around with your leg in this condition. You have a -8 penalty to dodges, and -4 to Accuracy and all other d20 rolls. You can spend 1 Willpower to force yourself to move despite the difficulty doing so. Doing so halves these penalties, and the reduction to your agility, for the next 50 IC.\n\nOn your own, this takes two weeks to heal for every 5% movement speed reduction. Every 15% recovered also lowers the dodge penalty by 2, and the penalties to other rolls by 1. Medical attention lets you recover at twice that rate.</text>\n# Recovery\n>1. Hit Points and Vitality\n2. Fatigue\n3. Willpower\n4. Wounds\n5. Medical Attention\n6. Guidelines\n###### a. IC and OOC Recovery\n   b. Rest\n\n====================\n1. Hit Points and Vitality\n------------------------------\n\nLost Vitality recovers fairly quickly; ninja don't get too far through their training without being able to get back on their feet. You recover 10% of your maximum Vitality every 10 minutes OOC.\n\nLost Hit Points are harder to deal with. By the time you're taking HP damage, your body's already reached its limit as far as soaking damage goes. You recovery 10% of your max HP every 1 hour OOC.\n\n====================\n2. Fatigue\n------------------------------\n\nFatigue is more than just being a little winded; it's exhaustion and bone-deep weariness. Ninja are just much better able to deal with such things than normal people. Every hour that passes OOC, your Fatigue is lowered by one level.\n\n====================\n3. Willpower\n------------------------------\n\nYou begin every (OOC) day with your full amount of Willpower. With the exception of some rare effects, you can't get Willpower back any faster than that.\n\n====================\n4. Wounds\n------------------------------\n\nWounds are particularly grievous injuries, ones powerful enough to have effects beyond just beating you that much closer to unconsciousness. The rules for what causes Wounds are discussed in the appropriate section of the combat chapter.\n\nAnd, so are their recovery times! How long a given wound takes to heal will be listed in that wound's own description. Those are, unless specified otherwise, base times, and can be reduced by medical attention (as described below).\n\nMinor wounds all heal at the same rate, with or without rest or medical attention. Most wounds will heal even if you're not getting rest, with details listed for each individual wound; if it says nothing on the matter, rest or lack thereof won't change its recovery time.\n\n====================\n5. Medical Attention\n------------------------------\n\nAll the listed recovery times assume you're waiting to get better on your own; ninja have a remarkable ability to recover from injuries, full as they are of vim and vigor.\n\nNaturally, you heal faster when you're actually getting rest and have trained medical professionals looking after you. In fact, you regain everything except Willpower twice as fast when receiving medical attention.\n\n...Which brings us to what 'medical attention' means. It means you are in a hospital, or getting an equivalent amount of bed rest, with one or more doctors or medics checking up on you regularly. You are getting sleep and being taken care of, not training or researching a new jutsu. You can most likely have visitors.\n\nEvery ninja village's hospital is always open to its shinobi. That said, if you try to check yourself in because you have no vitality and half your HP, and want to spar your friend again that afternoon, you will promptly get kicked out. On the other hand, if you're beaten to a pulp (unconscious at 0 HP) or severely injured (you have a Wound of Major or greater) you can check yourself in.\n\nHowever, once you've gone to a hospital they won't let you leave for 24 OOC hours, unless it's on important business--such as being required for a mission your village is sending you on. The doctors have gotten very good at seeing through people's excuses.\n\\page\n\n====================\n6. Guidelines\n------------------------------\n\nSometimes people get silly ideas and have to be corrected. This is to hopefully preempt that, by clarifying a few things! You probably don't need to read anything in this section unless it actually comes up during gameplay.\n\n\n###     a.  IC and OOC Recovery\nWhat happens if you're IC and need to know how fast you heal? For example, if you're on a mission, or trying to buy time between fights. If it takes ten minutes to RP a conversation, have you healed in that time? What about if you need to step away from your computer for an hour to do laundry, but there's someone who just drew a knife on you?\n\nFor the most part, this really doesn't matter; you can assume OOC healing times apply unless it actually is an important situation.\n\nShould such a situation (that is, an important one, or a GM-run event), use the following in-character times:\n10% Vitality: 1 hour\n10% HP: 6 hours\n1 Fatigue level: 6 hours\nWillpower: Restored fully after six consecutive hours of restful sleep.\nWounds: 1 OOC day = 1 IC week\n\nMedical attention does halve those times.\n\n\n###     b.  Rest\nYour body can't heal when you're putting too much stress on it. It's why doctors recommend bed rest (and lots of fluids, and &quot;grape&quot; flavored medicine that tastes just horrid, and nothing like grapes).\n\n'Rest' for a ninja, however, does not entail laying in bed for the afternoon. Taking damage, or failing a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll, interrupts your healing; this applies to Vitality, HP, and Stamina. So, if you had been recovering from 0 Vitality, Fatigue 3, and full HP for an hour and fifteen minutes, then did something to exert yourself and failed a Stamina roll, you'd have recovered 70% of your maximum Vitality (75 minutes, /10 = 7) and 1 Fatigue level, putting you at Fatigue 2--except you just failed that roll, so back to Fatigue 3 you go.\n\nThat doesn't apply to Wounds (unless specified otherwise) or Willpower. If your healing of a Wound is interrupted (usually by a method mentioned in that Wound's description), you still keep however many days of progress you've made towards recovering from it--you just don't get to count the current day.\n\nIf, for some reason, you are suffering from starvation, dehydration, or sleep deprivation (less than 6 hours of restful sleep a night), all of your healing times, including Willpower, are doubled. For wounds, this means that every 2 consecutive days of healing count as only 1 (in case you, before having fully recovered, return to sleeping/eating/drinking and are able to resume healing at the normal rate).\n\n\\page\n# Skills\n\nSkills represent broad, generic things ninja do, and how well your character can do them. Unlike abilities or jutsu, the exact method of performing a skill is ambiguous; you might use stealth by hiding in foliage, or by camouflaging yourself, but in game terms it's all about the same.\n\nYour skills all have a limit of 5 +(your total XP)/200 ranks. A lot of them benefit from practical application and general worldliness. Actually increasing your skills up to that limit, however, requires you to spend skill points.\n\nYou get 1 Skill Point for every 25 XP you gain; this happens automatically, for free, and you cannot buy more skill points. A single skill point raises a single skill by one rank. Clanless characters gain 1 skill point for every 20 XP instead.\n\nFor example, if you had 600 XP you would have a total of (600 /25 =) 24 skill points, and you could raise any of your skills up to rank (5 + 600/200 = ) 8. You could use this to raise your Stealth to rank 8, your Awareness to 4, Chakra Control to 6, Resistance to 5, and Survival to 1 (8 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 1 = 24).\n\nA skill roll is 1d20 + (your ranks in the skill). Even if you haven't raised a skill beyond zero, you may still make a plain 1d20 roll when attempting to perform a task that would call for that skill.\n\nSome skills are labeled &quot;Trained&quot;, which means you cannot make any roll at all unless you have at least 1 rank in them. These are generally skills which represent knowledge you have to learn, instead of something that can be attempted intuitively.</text>\n\n### Athletics\nYou use athletics when you perform acrobatics, leap across a chasm, try to navigate difficult terrain, weave your way between traps, swim across a river, or so forth. You can flip, tumble, and keep your balance under difficult circumstances.\n\n### Awareness\nHow perceptive you are. This applies to things like hearing a faint noise, noticing that you're being followed, spying on a single conversation in a crowded room, and finding an enemy hiding from you in combat.\n\n### Chakra Control\nThis is your ability to control the flow of the chakra within your own body, using it efficiently and shaping it precisely to do what you want. To a limited extent, it also represents how intuitively aware you are of the nature of chakra in general, and might allow you to notice when something's unusual about the surrounding chakra.\n\n### Espionage\nSomething of a catch-all skill, this includes most things shady and underhanded. Pickpocketing, lock-picking, setting and disarming (or sabotaging) traps, forging documents, sleight of hand, and disguising yourself all fall under the umbrella of espionage.\n\n### Medicine (Trained)\nYou have knowledge of the human body and how it works. This includes biology, first aid, and at higher levels actual medical procedures and requirements. With a few ranks, you can probably apply a tourniquet; with enough, you might even deserve a 'Doctor' in front of your name (but good luck actually getting any respect!).\n\n### Research (Trained)\nBook smarts, overall knowledge, and an ability to gather information. Research can be used to solve complicated code and ciphers, find information in a library, and get up to date on the latest gossip when in a new town.\n\n### Resistance\nNot to be confused with resilience, this is how well your body is able to fend off the ravages of the environment and all sorts of unpleasantness that might befall it, from blistering heat to poison to burns. This is primarily useful for fighting off unpleasant status effects that may afflict you, both in combat and out.\n\n### Stealth\nHow well you can sneak around, keep out of view, and not be obnoxiously loud. Whenever you need to be unobtrusive, hide from enemies, or move from point A to point B being noticed, stealth is your best friend. A ninja who can't be stealthy probably won't get very far in their career without some significant redeeming qualities.\n\n### Survival\nThis lets you forage for food and move easily through hostile environments. While resistance might keep sunburn at bay while stranded in the desert, survival will help you find the nearest oasis and make an umbrella out of palm fronds. It's also used to track people and animals, and avoid being tracked.\n\n### Toxicology (Trained)\nThis represents overall familiarity with poisons. While high enough medicine might be able to identify a poison, its symptoms, and how to treat it, toxicology knows what plant or animal that poison comes from, how long it takes for effects to set in, and just how deadly it can be. Many medics have enough of this skill to be helpful in their work... but it's also very handy if you find yourself needing to poison someone.\n\n\\page\n# Abilities\n\n>1. What Abilities Are\n2. Purchasing Abilities\n\n====================\n1. What Abilities Are\n------------------------------\n\nAbilities represent the fruits of your character's training, and the ways in which they've developed as a shinobi. What abilities you take will play a large role in shaping how you perform in combat and other situations.\n\nAbilities are more specific than skills; they differ from jutsu in that while a jutsu is a specific technique, any ability is a way of doing something or a permanent increase in your capabilities.\n\nMost abilities are passive improvements, giving you new capabilities or making you able to do a certain thing better. You may choose to 'not use' a given ability at any time, essentially a form of holding back.\n\n====================\n2. Purchasing Abilities\n------------------------------\n\nAbilities are acquired by spending XP. Some abilities will list only a &quot;Cost&quot;; for those abilities, you spend that much XP and acquire the ability, and that is it.\n\nOthers will list both a &quot;Base Cost&quot; and a &quot;Scale.&quot; These abilities can be purchased more than once. The first time, you pay the Base Cost in XP; each future purchase has its cost increased by the Scale.\n\nFor example, the Enhanced Hearing ability has Base Cost 4, Scale 3. One rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost 4 XP. The second would cost (4+3) 7 XP, and the third would cost (4+3+3) 10 XP. So, the total XP spent to get all three ranks would be (4 + 7 + 10) 21 XP.\n\nAbilities with more than one rank will also include a Limit entry. This is what controls how many ranks of the ability you can have. So, if an ability (such as Attentive) said &quot;Research /5&quot; and you had 12 ranks of Research, you could buy that ability twice.\n\nMany abilities will include in their limit line a maximum, such as &quot;Limit: CHA /10, max 4&quot;. This means that you may take that ability up to that many times (so in that example, 4).\n\nCertain abilities will also say &quot;Requires: (something)&quot;. You cannot take any ranks in that ability unless you meet the requirement.</text>\n\\page\n\n# Physical Abiltiies:\n>1.

Mobility:\n   Evasive,\n   Nimble,\n   Runner,\n   Sudden Attack,\n   Swift,\n\n====================\n1. Vigor\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Brute Force =-\nYou're good at... well, exactly what it sounds like: applying a lot of force all at once. It might be sheer physical strength, or you could just know how to strike properly. Each rank increases your physical damage bonus by 0.2.\n\n###### Base Cost: 1\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limit: STR /10\n###### Requires: 80 STR\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Cadence =-\nOnce you get into a good rhythm, you find it easier and easier to maintain and keep building your  momentum. All your Combo jutsu have &quot;-1 Stamina&quot; added to their Combo Counter line. This  cannot reduce a technique's cost below half its normal value.\n\n###### Cost: 30\n###### Requires: +6 or higher bonus to Stamina rolls, without Fatigue bonuses\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Endurance =-\nYour extensive physical conditioning has given you an almost preternatural ability to shrug off damage. When you block, you may choose to  reduce the damage dealt by an additional 10% at the first rank, or an additional 25% at the second rank. This may only be done once every 30-(RES/10) IC.\n\n###### Base Cost: 25\n###### Scale: 10\n###### Limit: 2\n###### Requires: 60 RES\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Fortitude =-\nEvery rank of this ability gives you a +2 bonus to Resistance rolls when you block an attack (even if you are doing so reflexively); if you've declared that you're blocking, this also applies to any effects requiring a Resistance roll which you wouldn't normally get to defend against (such as the B-rank Poison Mist).\n\nIf you've declared you're blocking for a certain time period, and take another defense (for example: you are blocking from IC 20 to IC 30, and on IC 24 you dodge an attack, and are hit) you still have half this ability's normal bonus applied to your Resistance rolls.\n\n###### Base Cost: 2\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: STR /20, max 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Good Lungs =-\nAll this ninja work has left you well beyond what peak physical condition would be for an ordinary person. In addition to being able to fight and exert yourself for abnormally long times, you recover from such exertion almost supernaturally fast. When you use the Rest action to lower your Stamina penalty, it's reduced by 1 more per rank (so at two ranks, a Speed 5 Rest action would decrease your Stamina penalty by 3).\n\n###### Base Cost: 10\n###### Scale: 5\n###### Limit: RES /80\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Hard to Kill =-\nYou prove distressingly difficult to make dead. Your max Vitality and HP are increased by 10% per rank. However, Wounds are calculated off your unmodified (&quot;true&quot;) maximums.\n\nFor example, if you had 1000 Vitality and 3 ranks of Hard to Kill, you'd have 1300 Vitality. However, your &quot;true&quot; maximum would still be 1000, and wounds would be determined based off what percent of 1000 Vitality their damage was.\n\n###### Base Cost: 6\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limit: RES /20\n###### Requires: 80 RES\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Healthy =-\nYou get plenty of exercise, and probably eat healthily. When your job places serious physical demands upon you (such as leaping across chasms and running over rooftops), this can be useful. You have a +1 bonus to Stamina rolls per rank.\n\n###### Base Cost: 6\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Athletics /5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Power Attack =-\nYou put extra force behind your unarmed strikes, turning your feeble punches into fearsome punches! Or... something like that.\n\nEach rank allows you to increase the Stamina cost, and die size, of your basic unarmed attack by 2. So at rank 1, you could deal 2d6 damage for 7 Stamina; and at rank 4, you could deal 2d12 damage for 13 Stamina.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 4\n###### Limit: STR /20, max 4\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Resilient =-\nYou're harder to hurt than you have any right to be! Each rank reduces damage you take from Grapple Taijutsu by 5%.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limit: RES /20, max 10\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Rigorous Training =-\n\nYou've spent time training in, or just being exposed to, extreme conditions; sitting under waterfalls, trudging through sand dunes, or enduring intense cold without the proper clothing are all examples of how this might come about. You have a +1 bonus to Resistance rolls per rank.\n\n###### Base Cost: 2\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: RES /20\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Unarmed Focus =-\nYou've trained to improve your sheer physical prowess; even when resorting to simple, non-jutsu attacks, you hit hard. May or may not be the result of deciding to train by punching trees until your knuckles bleed.\n\nEach rank lets you roll one more die when making a basic unarmed attack.\n\n###### Base Cost: 3\n###### Scale: 0\n###### Limit: (STR - 20) /10\n\n====================\n2. Mobility\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Evasive =-\nYou're big on not being around when people try to violently end your life. Every rank gives you a +1 bonus to dodge, it's awesome!\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: AGI /20, max 10\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Nimble =-\nWhen targeted by an area-of-effect attack that gives you a dodge penalty based on its size, that penalty is reduced by 2 per rank, to a minimum of 0.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limit: AGI /20\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Runner =-\nYou're both a distance runner and sprinter! Pretty awesome, huh? Every rank in this ability increases your AGI for the purpose of movement by 10% when you're taking a Move action; moving as part of an attack, or techniques such as Shunshin, do not receive Runner's bonus.\n\n###### Base Cost: 3\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Athletics /3, max 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Sudden Attack =-\nYou sacrifice power for speed and precision, trying to overwhelm or overcome your opponent's defenses before they have a chance to protect themselves. For every rank, you may take a bonus of up to +1 on a damaging taijutsu attack's Accuracy; each +1 reduces its damage by 10%.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limit: DEX /20, max 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Swift =-\nSwift, adjective; happening quickly or promptly. Your swiftness allows you to react faster, and makes it harder for your opponents to keep up with you. Each rank gives you +1 to Accuracy.\n\n###### Base Cost: 8\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: (AGI - 50) /10, max 5</text>\n\n\\page\n\n# Subtlety Abilities\n> 1.

Deception\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Cunning =-\nYou're an expert at misdirection; you know the signs people look for and pick up on in battle, and you know how to either give the wrong ones, or none at all. This gives you a +1 bonus to Accuracy per rank.\n\n###### Base Cost: 8\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Espionage /5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Cunning Blow =-\nIf you attack an opponent within 10 IC after you've successfully defended against an attack they made which targeted you, you have a +4 bonus to Accuracy.\n\n###### Cost: 50\n###### Requires: 20 Espionage\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Stalker =-\nSomewhere along the way you picked up the unpleasant, but highly effective talent of being able to follow people for prolonged periods of time without being noticed.\n\nEach rank gives you +1 to your Stealth TN once you're already hidden. The odd ranks (1, 3, and 5) each give +1 to your Accuracy with Sneak Attacks made from stealth.\n\n###### Base Cost: 6\n###### Scale: 3\n###### Limit: DEX /20, max 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Subterfuge =-\nYou are all kinds of sneaky. You know how to lie and make it seem like you're telling the truth, or how to tell the truth while convincing anyone listening that it's a lie.\n\nEvery rank gives you +1 to Espionage and Stealth rolls.\n\n###### Base Cost: 3\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Espionage /3, max 5\n\n\n====================\n2. Ninja Tactics\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Basic Training =-\nNinja with the ability to use chakra can get away with not solving every problem through the application of stealth and cunning, it's true. But, to be viewed as a proper ninja, they need to be keenly aware of their surroundings, masters of deception, and able to vanish like a shadow.\n\nIn practice, genin find those things exceptionally boring, especially when they could be learning how to shoot fireballs instead. Every rank gives you a +1 bonus to Accuracy, defensive rolls, and skill checks.\n\n###### Base Cost: 10\n###### Scale: 5\n###### Limit: Lower of Awareness /5, Espionage /5, or Stealth /5 ; max 5 ranks\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Defensive Formation =-\nYou take up a position protecting someone from harm. Very useful on escort missions when you have to keep some blubbering civilian safe! You declare this as an action the same way you would blocking, while designating one or more (up to 1+XP/1000) targets within AGI/20 yards of you. If one of those people is attacked during your Defensive Formation, you may immediately attempt to Take The Hit, without increasing your next action as would be normal for using an Interrupt, with a +10 bonus.\n\nAgainst area-of-effect attacks, if you do this you take the full damage, and they take only half (which they can reduce by their own defenses). The protected target can still defend themself, but if they move out of your protective radius the Defensive Formation is automatically aborted.\n\nYou may simultaneously declare any two of: Block, Guard, Total Defense, Defensive Formation, and similar actions not listed in this chapter (such as the Uchiha's Observe).\n\n###### Cost: 25\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Guard =-\nYou ready yourself for an impending attack. Guard is an action declared similar to blocking. While Guarding, you have a +5 bonus to accuracy when parrying enemy attacks (including with jutsu, such as Halting Blow and Crossroads of Heaven). Your Parry action itself becomes a Speed 0 Interrupt.\n\nYou may simultaneously declare any two of: Block, Guard, Total Defense, Defensive Formation, and similar actions not listed in this chapter (such as the Uchiha's Observe).\n\n###### Cost: 20\n###### Requires: 45 DEX\n\n______________________\n\n\n### -= Safety Dance =-\nThis does not actually have anything to do with dancing. Indeed, if you are dancing, you probably won't be able to pull this off! You stay on edge while recuperating mid-battle, never letting your guard down. When you take a Rest action, you are also considered to be Blocking until your next non-Interrupt action.\n\n###### Cost: 60\n###### Requires: 60 STR\n\\page\n# Sensory Abilities\n>1. Enhanced Senses:\n   Enhanced Hearing,\n   Enhanced Sight,\n   Blind Fighting,\n   Keen Senses\n2. Perception:\n   Accurate,\n   Instinct,\n   Sixth Sense\n\n====================\n1. Enhanced Senses\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Enhanced Hearing =-\nYour hearing isn't actually (much) better than a normal person's, but you've learned how to not do what everyone normally does: tune out quiet, 'insignificant' background noises. You still can if you need to, but you can also avoid doing that, when you need to, say, listen for a skulking opponent.\n\nThis gives you a +1 bonus to Awareness rolls per rank.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 3\n###### Limit: CHA /10, max 4\n\nSpecial: The two &quot;Enhanced (Sense)&quot; abilities share a Scale. That is, if you already had four ranks of Enhanced Sight, the first rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost (4+(3*4) = ) 16 XP.\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Enhanced Sight =-\nYou're very good with attention to detail. You notice things that other people overlook, and as it turns you, that's a pretty useful job-related talent for a ninja. You get +1 Awareness per rank.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 3\n###### Limit: CHA /10, max 4\n\nSpecial: The two &quot;Enhanced (Sense)&quot; abilities share a Scale. That is, if you already had four ranks of Enhanced Sight, the first rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost (4+(3*4) = ) 16 XP.\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Blind Fighting =-\nBetween smoke bombs, stealth missions at night, and hostile ninjutsu, shinobi often find themselves operating with their vision impaired. This ability represents training to fight while relying on your other senses. Each rank of Blind Fighting reduces the maximum visibility penalty you can suffer from by 1.\n\n###### Base Cost: 7\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Enhanced Hearing ranks, max 4\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Keen Senses\nYou're very good at picking up on tiny things that are just ever-so-slightly out of place! Normally, you get a cumulative +2 bonus every time you attempt to find someone using a Search action in combat. This raises that to +3 at the first rank, and +4 at the second.\n\n###### Base Cost: 8\n###### Scale: 4\n###### Limit: (Enhanced Sight ranks) /2\n\n\n====================\n2. Perception\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Accurate =-\nYou've got good hand-eye coordination, which lends itself towards hitting with your attacks. You have a +1 bonus per rank to your Accuracy.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: DEX /20, max 10\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Instinct =-\nYou've learned to rely on your instincts to guide you in battle, helping to improve your reaction time. Not by much--but enough to matter. Each rank gives a +1 bonus to dodge.\n\n###### Base Cost: 8\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Survival /5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Sixth Sense =-\nNinja really do seem to have one, and no experienced shinobi will deny it, not once they've faced down an opponent and actually, physically felt the killing intent radiating from them, or experienced a half-second of dread in the instant before an ambush was sprung. Nobody can quantify it, or say for sure what causes it, but ninja who don't want to die do well to listen to it.\n\nYou have a +1 bonus to Awareness and defensive rolls per rank. Whenever you would be surprise or sneak attacked this automatically activates, allowing you to defend against it as if it was a normal attack. Each time this activates, the Awareness and defensive bonuses are reduced by 1 each; once they reach 0, your Sixth Sense stops functioning. This refreshes at the beginning of each day.\n\n###### Base Cost: 10\n###### Scale: 4\n###### Limit: CHA /40<\n\\page\n\n# Chakra Abilities\n>1.

Genjutsu:\n   Attentive,\n   Genjutsu Awareness,\n   Genjutsu Competence,\n   Genjutsu Mastery,\n   Illusion Multi-Targeting\n\n====================\n1. Nature Control\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Elemental Affinity =-\n\nEvery ninja has a natural affinity for one of the five primary elements, though some may not discover it until later. This ability can be taken for any one of the five elements, even one your character cannot use.\n\nFor each rank, you get a +1 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra Control rolls involving your favored element. The Chakra Control skill requirements to learn jutsu of your chosen element are considered 1 point lower, per rank. You may only take this ability for a single element, ever.\n\n###### Base Cost: 0\n###### Scale: +1\n###### Limit: CHA /20, max 5\n\nSome clans start with a specific Elemental Affinity, giving them one rank in this ability. This does not (necessarily) provide them with the matching Elemental Aptitude, though it does mean they cannot change their affinity.\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Elemental Aptitude =-\n\nThe shinobi of the world recognize five primary elements of chakra: fire, water, wind, earth, and lightning. These elements and their properties form the basis of most modern ninjutsu techniques.\n\nHowever, actually using elemental chakra requires the ability to convert one's own chakra to the appropriate element, which is what this ability provides.\n\nIn simpler terms, when you take Elemental Aptitude, select one of the five elements; you may use elemental ninjutsu of that element. Each additional rank of this ability allows you to use another element.\n\n###### Base Cost: 5\n###### Scale: +25\n###### Limit: 3\n\nCertain clans begin with one or more ranks in this ability. In these cases, they have the first one or two ranks in this ability for free, but must pay that cost when buying the next one.\n\nFor example, a Touu begins with elemental aptitude for Water and Wind. Normally, this would cost (5 + (5+25)) 35 XP; instead, it costs 0. However, when they buy access to their third element, doing so costs (55 + 35) 90 XP.\n\n====================\n2. Shape Control\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Improved Area =-\nThis supplements your ninjutsu techniques, increasing their areas of effect by up to your ninjutsu damage bonus; you can use some, all, or none of this effect on a given technique, as you please. This bonus cannot exceed the technique's base area.\n\n###### Cost: 20\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Improved Range =-\nYou're able to keep your chakra coherent for longer; the further it can travel before dissipating (or the faster you can propel it, or whatever)... well, the advantages should be obvious. This increases the range of any ninjutsu techniques you use by up to double your ninjutsu damage bonus in yards. This bonus cannot exceed the technique's base range.\n\n###### Cost: 20\n______________________\n\n### -= Potent Chakra =-\nYou're able to increase your chakra's density, and in turn preserve some of the energy that would dissipate into the atmosphere around you in whatever sort of attack you're using.\n\nBut all you really care about is that it makes your ninjutsu hurt more! Each rank increases your ninjutsu damage bonus by 0.2.\n\n###### Base Cost: 1\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limit: CHA /10\n###### Requires: 80 CHA\n\n\n====================\n3. Chakra Control\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Refined Chakra Control =-\n\nYour precise control of chakra allows you to spend it more efficiently, wasting less and getting more out of what you do spend. Each rank of this ability gives you a +1 bonus on your Chakra Exhaustion rolls.\n\n###### Base Cost: 6\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Chakra Control /5, max 5\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Wall Walking =-\nEvery village teaches this, usually to their genin, as a form of training to hone their chakra control skills. Training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra at the bottom of one's feet and using that to adhere to a wall, tree, or other vertical surface.\n\nWith this ability you can scale vertical surfaces, stand on ceilings, and so forth, at your normal movement speed.\n\n###### Cost: 10\n###### Requires: 8 Chakra Control\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Water Walking =-\nYou can stand on water! Ninja do this in the same way they'd adhere to a vertical surface, though actually pulling it off is much harder because the water is constantly moving underneath them, meaning the strength and distribution of chakra has to be constantly changed. Once a shinobi is skilled enough, though, this becomes second nature, just like keeping one's balance on an unsteady surface.\n\n###### Cost: 15\n###### Requires: 15 Chakra Control, Wall Walking\n\n\n====================\n4. Advanced Training\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Genjutsu Training =-\nYou've mastered the art of... yeah, okay, no. You are able to use entry-level Genjutsu techniques. It's not much, but it's a start.\n\n###### Cost: 20\n###### Requires: Research 4\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Advanced Medical Training =-\n\nYou've spent enough time studying the human body and how it interacts with chakra, and honing your medical skills, to use even the most advanced medicinal techniques. This ability allows you to learn medical ninjutsu of B rank and above.\n\n###### Cost: 25\n###### Requires: Medical Training talent, Skill Focus: Medicine 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Advanced Seal Training =-\n\nAs in sealing techniques, not handseals! This allows you to learn the most advanced fuuinjutsu. These are often extremely complicated, and even slight mistakes result in them being useless. Through unrelenting practice and hours of study, you've gained a sufficient understanding of how and why seals work to be able to handle the most advanced techniques.\n\nThis ability allows you to learn A-rank Sealing Ninjutsu.\n\n###### Cost: 25\n###### Requires: Seal Training talent, Skill Focus: Research 5\n\n\n====================\n5. Genjutsu\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Attentive =-\nYou pay lots of attention to details! Beyond that, you're keen to pick up on things that other people wouldn't. Maybe that species of deer isn't native to this area, or the wood of an illusory wall is a type that isn't found in this part of the world.\n\nOn the other hand, the more you know about these kinds of things, the more likely you are to get them right. Each rank gives a +1 bonus to your genjutsu rolls.\n\n###### Base Cost: 8\n###### Scale: 3\n###### Limit: Research /5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Genjutsu Awareness =-\nYou're good at picking up little details in your environment that aren't quite what they should be. Maybe it's that the ringing noise in your head isn't reverberating right, maybe it's that whoever constructed an illusion around you forgot to put door handles on all the doors.\n\nWhatever it is, it gives you a +1 bonus to defensive Genjutsu rolls per rank.\n\n###### Base Cost: 10\n###### Scale: 5\n###### Limit: Lower of your Enhanced Hearing or Enhanced Sight ranks\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Genjutsu Competence =-\nGenjutsu is notoriously difficult; very few ninja are able to just 'pick it up' without difficulty. Even being mediocre with genjutsu requires a significant amount of training and practice--which this ability represents.\n\nEach rank gives you a +1 bonus to your offensive Genjutsu rolls.\n\n###### Base Cost: 2\n###### Scale: 0\n###### Limit: (XP + 200)/400\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Genjutsu Mastery =-\nOkay, NOW you've mastered the art of Genjutsu. Each rank gives you a +1 bonus to genjutsu rolls.\n\nYou can have 1 rank in this ability for each rank of genjutsu you know at least one technique from. Thus, if you knew an E-rank, D-rank, and B-rank move, you could have 3 ranks of Genjutsu Mastery.\n\n###### Base Cost: 6\n###### Scale: 4\n###### Limit: Special\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Illusion Multi-Targeting =-\nThis allows you to apply a genjutsu which normally must target a single person at once to any number of people. Every 1 point of Willpower spent allows your genjutsu to target two more people, at no additional cost and using your same genjutsu roll.\n\n###### Cost: 25\n###### Requires: Know at least one C-rank Genjutsu.</text>\n\n\\page\n# Equipment Abilities\n>1.

Ninja Tools\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Money: Requisition =-\n\nAs a ninja, you get most of your supplies from your village. This ability represents how much you're authorized to bring with you on any mission. For every rank, you can have 50 Ryo worth of equipment from the Equipment chapter at once.\n\nThis works more like a limit than something you actually 'spend'; you can replaced used items, trade in ones you no longer have a need for, and so forth, at will so long as you're not away from the village.\n\n###### Base Cost: 2\n###### Scale: 0\n###### Limit: None\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Money: Savings =-\n\nThis is a nest egg of money you've set aside and saved up over time. For each rank, you have 100 Ryo that you can spend as you please. However, this money cannot be refunded or replenished; used or broken items are simply lost.\n\n###### Base Cost: 2\n###### Scale: 0\n###### Limit: None\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Bingo Book =-\nThe bingo book is a pocket-sized book put out by each village, with information on missing nin and enemy ninja of note. This information includes their bounties, their reputation, and any abilities which the village may be willing to publicize.\n\nHaving this ability means you keep an up-to-date copy of the bingo book; you can steal someone else's, but they generally get updated every few months.\n\n###### Cost: 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Icha Icha Novels =-\n\nIcha Icha is a series of best-selling novels written by the legendary ninja sage Jiraiya. They are comedic (and adult) recounts of Jiraiya's experiences in love. The titles include Icha Icha Paradise, Icha Icha Violence, Icha Icha Tactics, and Icha Icha Utopia.\n\nThey are intended only for audiences over 18 years of age, and managing to acquire and read them in secret is a challenge countless young ninja strive to overcome. Indeed, it's how many shinobi (though most kunoichi would never admit it) hone their abilities of stealth and deception.\n\nFor every rank, you have read one of the Icha Icha novels. Every novel you've read gives you a +1 bonus to your Espionage rolls.\n\n###### Base Cost: 6\n###### Scale: 4\n###### Limit: 4\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Aerosolized Poisons =-\nAs popular as poisons are with (some) shinobi, they suffer from being relatively difficult to deliver effectively. While gaseous poisons are one of the most effective ways of accomplishing that, very few of the toxins suitable for use against shinobi can be deployed that way.\n\nUnless, of course, someone is willing to invest a great deal of time and resources into specially preparing those poisons, and learning enough about them to understand the dangers of those preparations.\n\nLike you!\n\nThis ability allows you to create a Poison Smoke Bomb from any Contact poison (as found in the Equipment chapter). The total cost for the poison smoke bomb is doubled (for example, Water Hemlock Poison Smoke Bombs would be 1200 ryo each), and the Toxicology roll has a -4 penalty.\n\n###### Cost: 50\n###### Requires: 25 Toxicology\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Tag Concealment =-\nNinjas do love their explosions. However, they also like being sneaky and unseen; this combines the two!\n\nWhen placing an exploding tag, you can hide it from the casual observer. This requires something for it to be hidden under (such as loose soil, or leaves; you cannot 'hide' them in plain sight in a featureless room). Hiding a tag is a Speed 10 action, and anyone watching you will realize what you're doing and where it is (meaning it cannot be accomplished outside of stealth in combat).\n\nWhen you hide the tag, make an Espionage roll. Anyone who enters the tag's range is allowed an Awareness roll against the result, without any bonuses they may have from the Enhanced Hearing ability. Success means they've spotted the tag.\n\nOnce a tag has begun its countdown to detonation they start to sizzle and spark, alerting anyone to their presence and approximate direction (though not exact location), giving them a chance to escape before time runs out.\n\n###### Cost: 10\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n2. Weapons, Melee\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Ambidextrous =-\nYou've trained yourself to use your off-hand just as well as your dominant one, or you really are naturally ambidextrous. Each rank reduces the Accuracy penalty for dual-wielding (see below) by 1, and gives you a +1 bonus to parries using those weapons while dual-wielding.\n\n###### Base Cost: 5\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: DEX /20, max 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Dual Wielding =-\nYou attack with a weapon in each hand! Impractical, but awesome. As might be expected, this allows you to make a basic weapon attack with both weapons simultaneously.\n\nHalve the speed of both the weapons you're using (rounding up, as usual). Add those two numbers together to get the speed of your &quot;Dual Wield Attack&quot; action.\n\nYou use the lower of the two weapons' Accuracy. This is defended against as a single attack, using its total Speed. The Stamina cost to Dual-Wield is the higher Stamina cost of the two weapons, plus one third of the lower Stamina cost.\n\nIf you hit, you deal damage separately for both weapons, using the reduced Speed for each to determine their damage bonus. Weapons specifically marked as &quot;Dual&quot; calculate damage based on their natural Speed, rather than the halved value.\n\nLowering the Speed of a Dual Wield Attack action lowers the effective Speeds (for determining damage) of both component attacks by the same amount.\n\nThis can't be done with two-handed weapons. Unfortuantely, dual-wielding carries with it a -5 Accuracy penalty.\n\n###### Cost: 25\n###### Requires: 40 DEX\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Monkey Grip =-\nBy using extreme strength, chakra-based powers, and a cheerful disregard for physics, you are able to use two-handed weapons in one hand! Notably, this means they no longer benefit from their 50% increase in your damage bonus.\n\nAt the second rank you can, if you have the Dual Wield ability, even dual wield two-handed weapons.\n\n###### Base Cost: 30\n###### Scale: +10\n###### Limit: STR /50, max 2\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Quick Draw =-\nThe speed of your Draw Weapon is reduced by 1 per rank, to a minimum of 0.\n\n###### Base Cost: 7\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limit: DEX /30\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Weapon Focus: (Weapon) =-\nYou've trained yourself specifically with a single type of weapon. Choose one of the weapons from the Equipment chapter (such as Wakizashi, or Shuriken). You have +1 Accuracy and +1 to your damage bonus when using that weapon, per rank.\n\nYou may take this ability for different weapons, counting as a different ability (with a separate cost, number of ranks, etc.) each time. Any attack which benefits from your Weapon Focus has its Stamina cost increased by 3 per rank; you may choose to use less than your full ranks of Weapon Focus on a given attack if you wish.\n\n###### Base Cost: 6\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: (DEX -30) /30, max 3\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Weapon Throw =-\nYour hatred of physics gives you improbable powers. You are able to throw any melee weapon you're holding up to STR/4 yards, turning it into a ranged attack. This does the normal damage for that weapon, but increases the action's Stamina cost by 5.\n\n###### Cost: 15\n###### Requires: 40 STR, 40 DEX\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Blunt: Stun =-\nYour attacks stagger an opponent, club them upside the head, knock the wind out of them, or otherwise keeping them from recovering. Your blunt weapon attacks gain Stun 1 per rank, or increase their existing Stun by 1 per rank.\n\n###### Base Cost: 5\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: STR /20\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Large: Momentum =-\nYou turn one of the greatest enemies of shinobi--physics--to your own ends. Each rank gives a -1 penalty to any enemy's attempts to parry your weapon.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: STR /20, max 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Piercing: Penetrate =-\nYour piercing weapons ignore any armor your opponent is wearing!\n\n###### Cost: 20\n###### Requires: 35 STR\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Polearm: Trip =-\nYou sweep with the blunt end (or one of the blunt ends) of your weapon, knocking your opponent's feet out from beneath them. This allows you to use Trip (the E-rank Unarmed Taijutsu technique) as a Weapon Taijutsu, as long as you know it.\n\n###### Cost: 10\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Slashing: Perfect Cut =-\nNormally, when partial defense applies you would deal 20% of your attack's damage per point you hit by. With this ability you do 25% per point you hit by, up to full damage if you hit by 4 points.\n\n###### Cost: 20\n###### Requires: 40 DEX\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Small: Flurry =-\nMost of the small weapons rely on something other than overpowering force to deal their damage; accordingly, a dozen quick strikes is often preferable to six slow, powerful ones.\n\nEach time you make an attack with a Small weapon, the total Speed of your next attack with that weapon is reduced by 1. This stacks for consecutive attacks; if you make three attacks with your weapon, without taking any non-Interrupt action inbetween, the next attack would have -3 total Speed. As a reminder, total Speed cannot go below half of base Speed. The maximum reduction is your number of ranks in this ability.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: DEX /20\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Sword: Iaijutsu =-\nThe first time in battle you attack with your sword, if you have yet to draw it (meaning it hasn't be used for parries or jutsu, either) the attack's Speed is halved, though for the purpose of damage calculations it's treated as its regular speed. This may only be done once per battle, even if you have more than one sword.\n\n###### Cost: 20\n###### Requires: 50 DEX, 40 AGI\n\n====================\n3. Weapons, Ranged\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Assassin's Eye =-\nYou've got a good eye for causing bodily harm to people from a distance. In any other job, this would just make you kind of scary. As a ninja, it looks good on your resume! Each rank of this ability reduces the penalty for called shots with ranged weapons by 1.\n\n###### Base Cost: 6\n###### Scale: 4\n###### Limit: DEX /30, max 3\n###### Requires: Enhanced Sight 3\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Combat Acupuncture =-\nYou can throw senbon to target vital points on an opponent's body. Whenever making a called shot with senbon, if you deal damage you inflict a -1 immobilization penalty on your foe. Using this on somebody already suffering from it increases the Immobilization penalty by 1 each time. Its effects end entirely 20 IC after the last time you hit with a senbon called shot. The maximum penalty is your ranks in Combat Acupuncture.\n\n###### Base Cost: 2\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: DEX /10\n###### Requires: Medicine 10\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Explosive Tag Connection =-\nAs a Speed 10 + 5 * X action, you can attach X tags to a kunai's hilt or an arrow, and prime them. These can be attached pre-battle as a matter of convenience, but the action to prime them is still necessary. You can have up to (Chakra Control)/5 tags primed this way at once.\n\nEach item (kunai or arrow) may only have a single tag attached to it. You can trigger these tags as part of a multi-throw, or do so later (such as by the Remote Detonation technique). When the kunai is thrown (or arrow shot) the tag(s) will detonate 15 IC after impact (with the target, or the ground at the target's feet on a miss).\n\nWhen used as a multi-throw, each tagged kunai counts as two weapons for the purpose of determining multi-throwing limit. You can include up to one tag per rank in this ability in a single throw.\n\nIf a target is struck by the arrow or kunai, they're assumed to pull it out as a non-action and can try to escape the area. Justu including exploding tags that cause them to explode on contact supercede these rules. \n\n###### Base Cost: 5\n###### Scale: 3\n###### Limit: Chakra Control / 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Improved Range =-\nYou can throw weapons farther than other people! It's useful, honest!... Kind of. Sometimes. Your max range with thrown weapons is increased by your damage bonus.\n\n###### Cost: 15\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Marksman =-\nYou've got uncannily good aim at a distance. You may give your ranged weapon attacks a bonus of up to +1 Accuracy per rank. However, each +1 received this way increases the Stamina cost of the action by 2.\n\nIn the case of ninjutsu which behave as ranged weapon attacks, increase whichever cost(s) the technique has (such as the Chakra cost on the D-rank Attached Meteor technique).\n\n###### Base Cost: 8\n###### Scale: 4\n###### Limit: DEX /30\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Quick Hands =-\nYou're very good at throwing lots of small objects very quickly!\n\nThis allows you to throw an extra 1 die of weapons when multi-throwing, without increasing the action's Speed; the Stamina cost is still increased normally (+1 for every 2 weapons total, adding together ones added normally and ones added by Quick Hands).\n\n###### Base Cost: 5\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limiting Attribute: DEX /20\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### -= Senbon Multi-Throw =-\nYou can multi-throw needles, just like you can normally multi-throw shuriken and kunai.\n\n###### Cost: 15\n###### Requires: 30 DEX\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Senbon User =-\nYou're a person who uses senbon in combat. This is rare, but not unheard of; it takes a lot of effort to get results out of them, but a weapon that allows the degree of precision they do can certainly be rewarding.\n\nThis ability removes their inherent -2 Accuracy penalty, and allows you to use your DEX, rather than STR, to determine your damage bonus with senbon. Finally, damage dealt by senbon is tripled for the purposes of calculating wounds.\n\n###### Cost: 15\n###### Requires: 25 DEX\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Surgical Precision =-\nWhen you wound an enemy with a senbon attack, you have a 10% chance per rank for the wound to be upgraded to the next-highest rank. If you don't wound them, this is replaced by a 10% chance per rank to cause a minor wound, so long as your attack did any damage. Every rank of this ability also raises the attack's Stamina cost by 1; you can choose whether or not to use it, and to what extent, when you attack.\n\nIf used on a multi-throwing attack with senbon, this is applied before the one-rank reduction in wound severity (from being a multi-throw).\n\n###### Cost: 2\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Medicine /2, max 10</text>\n\n\\page\n\n# OTHER Abilties\n>1.

Development:\n   Holding Back,\n   Progression\n\n====================\n1. Willpower\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Desperation =-\n\nBeing faced with truly dire straits brings out remarkable characteristics: in animals, in civilians, and in shinobi. Thankfully, you're one of those!\n\nYou can activate this ability when defending against an attack by spending a point of Willpower. Your Interrupt only needs to be double or less the Speed of the attack you're defending against, rather than half or less. This effect persists of the duration of that IC; if you're being attack four times in the same IC, then all four defenses would receive this benefit.\n\n###### Cost: 40\n###### Requires: 6 Willpower\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Determination =-\n\nYour force of will is as powerful an advantage in combat as your strength of body. Each rank of this ability increases your Willpower by 1.\n\n###### Base Cost: 50\n###### Scale: 25\n###### Limit: XP /1000\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Focus =-\n\nBeing left reeling and disoriented is an all-too-common experience for shinobi. Sometimes it's the result of genjutsu, other times it's a lucky blow to the solar plexus (or... lower). You're able to bring yourself back to the presence, by sheer mental fortitude, though doing so is bound to wear you out faster in the long run.\n\nBy spending 1 Willpower, you end any Stuns you're suffering from and become immune to any other instances of that status effect until the end of the current Initiative Count.\n\n###### Cost: 40\n###### Requires: 4 Willpower\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Guts =-\n\nYou refuse to go down in battle. So long as you're physically able to breathe, you will not stop fighting when your values are on the line. This can get downright frightening to behold, depending upon the circumstances.\n\nWhenever you would be reduced to 0 HP or lower, roll a TN 25 Stamina check. If you succeed, you are left with 1 HP, and cannot have your HP reduced until the end of that initiative count. If you fail, in addition to your Fatigue progressing you take the damage you normally would have from the attack. Damage negated through this ability still wounds you normally.\n\n###### Cost: 50\n###### Requires: 3 Willpower\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Limit Break =-\n\nThrough sheer determination you force yourself to perform above your own capabilities. Once per day, per rank, you may reroll any roll, or replace an Accuracy number with a d20 roll that adds your normal Accuracy rating as a bonus (not including the base 10 Accuracy). If this is a d20 roll and the result is below 11, add 10 to the die roll.\n\nHowever, doing this causes you to immediately proceed to the next Fatigue category. This ability can be used after you've determined whether your roll or attack would've succeeded normally.\n\n###### Base Cost: 20\n###### Scale: 5\n###### Limit: Willpower /2\n\n\n====================\n2. Initiative\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Defensive Reflexes =-\n\nYou're always ready to protect yourself, even when caught off guard. You may declare use of this ability when rolling your initiative for combat. You are considered to be blocking at the start of battle, but take a -4 penalty on your initiative roll. This penalty is reduced by 1 for each rank beyond the first.\n\n###### Base Cost: 10\n###### Scale: -2\n###### Limiting Attribute: RES/20, max 3\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Reflexes =-\n\nYou have excellent twitch reflexes. Mostly, this comes in handy for a ninja; you respond to danger before even fully determining what that danger is. This can be kind of awkward off-duty, when you respond to somebody trying to startle you by punching them in the gut and then flipping them over your shoulder, but that's what they get for trying to startle a ninja anyway. Each rank gives you +1 Initiative and each even rank gives a +1 Athletics bonus.\n\n###### Base Cost: 5\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limiting Attribute: AGI /10, Max 20\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Rush =-\n\nYou don't waste time doing things like getting warmed up and taking stock of the battlefield, instead opting to rush right into battle and make things up as you go along! You start battle with (AGI)*(number of ranks in this ability)/20 AP.\n\n###### Base Cost: 4\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limiting Attribute: AGI /20, max 5\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Preparation =-\n\nYou may, as part of your Initiative roll, activate one or more techniques with Upkeeps that affect only yourself. You must pay their Chakra or Stamina costs normally.\n\nThe total of the (Speed + modified Seal Speed) of all the techniques you use cannot exceed whatever you rolled for your initiative.\n\n###### Cost: 40\n###### Requires: 60 DEX\n\n\n====================\n3. Action Points\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Active =-\nYou get a lot done in combat. Whether it's quickly assessing the battlefield, exploiting an opening, or having that extra bit of adrenaline, you're already doing what needs to be done.\n\nEvery rank in this ability increases the AP you naturally gain each 20 IC by 1. Thus, if you had 3 ranks of Active, you'd get (5 + 3) 8 AP every time the IC reached a multiple of 20.\n\n###### Base Cost: 2\n###### Scale: 1\n###### Limit: AGI /20\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Principle of Motion =-\nYou're able to act blindingly fast, beyond what all reason suggests should be possible. You may at any time cause your next action to come 1 IC earlier for every 2 AP you spend.\n\nFor example, say it's initiative count 200, and you just took a speed 12 action. Your action ends that IC, moving the battle onto IC 201; normally your next action would occur on IC (200+12) = 212. By spending 22 AP, you could act on (IC 212 - 11) 201, in other words, immediately.\n\nThis only allows your next action to come sooner; it does not let you finish an ongoing action sooner. As such, Principle of Motion can't be used to make you finish Handseals early, or while you are in the process of using any action with a Delay.\n\nSimilarly, you can not use Principle of Motion to reverse time. You may use Principle of Motion only to bring your next action to what the current initiative count is. This means that if you take an action on IC 16, once it is resolved IC 17 begins--and that is the earliest you could activate Principle of Motion, meaning you would be unable to act twice on the same initiative count.\n\nAfter using Principle of Motion, you may not use it again until 10 IC have passed. You may not use Principle of Motion while stunned.\n\n###### Cost: 60\n###### Requires: 100 DEX, 100 AGI\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Surge =-\nYou can spend AP to improve an attack's accuracy, or a defensive action's roll. This costs 8 AP per +1 Accuracy, and 5 AP per +1 to a defensive roll. Either way, Surge may give a maximum of a +5 bonus, and is declared when the roll (or attack) is made.\n\n###### Cost: 40\n###### Requires: 80 AGI\n\n\n====================\n4. Skill\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Anatomical Knowledge =-\nYour knowledge of the human body develops sinister undertones. You can't learn how to treat life-threatening injuries without picking up more than a little bit of knowledge of how to cause life-threatening injuries. Each rank causes your taijutsu attacks (including those with ranged weapons, just as a reminder) to calculate wounds as if their damage was 5% higher.\n\n###### Base Cost: 6\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Medicine /5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Doctor =-\nAside from the basics of health and biology, and how to stabilize a dying comrade on the field, you've learned how to provide longer-term care for your allies.\n\nAt the first rank of this ability, you are able to provide 'medical attention' to people (as per the Recovery node in the combat chapter), as of they were hospitalized. Doing so requires you to have access to one First Aid kit per person you treat this way.\n\nAt the second rank, you may do this even without a First Aid kit. Finally, at the third rank, the recovery times for all people you are treating are halved, even beyond the normal reductions for receiving medical attention--you're just that good.\n\nYou can treat a number of people at once equal to your ranks in the Medicine skill. This is long-term treatment, so you can still take breaks, sleep, and so forth, as long as you are devoting most of your time to helping them heal.\n\n###### Base Cost: 10\n###### Scale: 5\n###### Limit: (Medicine - 5) /5, Max 3\n\n______________________\n\n### -= General Knowledge =-\nYou know a little bit about everything, and a lot about a few things. Unfortunately, most of a ninja's abilities depend upon talent rather than knowledge. For those that don't, you've got an extra edge! You have +1 per rank to Medicine, Survival, and Toxicology rolls.\n\n###### Base Cost: 5\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Research /5\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Skill Focus: (Skill) =-\nThis ability allows you to focus on a single skill at the expense of your overall performance. Most of the skills a ninja develops are picked up as a course of their regular training and experience. Skill focus represents taking extra time to focus on a specific talent, to the extent of all others.\n\nEach rank of Skill Focus increases your rank in the chosen skill by 1. This is an actual increase in rank, for all purposes, not a &quot;bonus&quot;. This ignores and does not count against the normal limit on skill ranks. You may take Skill Focus for multiple skills, each time treating it as a different ability with a separate cost scale.\n\n###### Base Cost: 2 Skill Points\n###### Scale: +1 Skill Point every odd-numbered rank\n###### (Ranks 1 and 2 cost 2 SP; ranks 3 and 4 cost 3 SP; and so forth).\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Specialization =-\n\nYou practice extensively with a chosen skill, so that even while you may still make mistakes, you don't make catastrophic ones; even at your worst, you're not terrible. Any time you roll below a 5 on a roll with that skill, your d20 roll is instead considered to be a 5.\n\nYou may take this ability multiple times. Each time you take it, it applies to a different skill.\n\n###### Base Cost: 10\n###### Scale: 0\n###### Requires: At least 5 ranks in each skill it's applied to.\n\n\n====================\n5. Development\n------------------------------\n\n### -= Holding Back =-\n\n...is a good idea when those 'friendly' training matches get a little bit out of control. You declare you're holding back when you make an attack. An attack that's been held back uses half your normal damage bonus, and any wounds it inflicts have their severity reduced by 1.\n\nAt the first rank this works on basic attacks and with E-rank jutsu; the next rank allows it to be used on D-ranks, the third on C-ranks, and so forth, up to A.\n\nNo, you can't hold back with S-rank moves.\n\n###### Base Cost: 5\n###### Scale: 2\n###### Limit: Max 5\n\n______________________\n\n### -= Progression =-\n\nOrdinarily, when raising your attributes, the amount you've raised one by must be within 3 points of the amount the next-highest has been raised by, and so forth (the 'rule of 3'). Every rank in this ability loosens that restriction by one.\n\nThus, instead of having spent XP to raise three stats by +3, +6, and +9, you could have a progression of +4, +8, and +12.\n\n###### Base Cost: 10\n###### Scale: 0\n###### Limit: XP/750</text>\n\n\n\\page\n\n# Jutsu\n>1. Explanation\n2. Rules\n3. Reader's Guide\n\n\n====================\n1. Explanation\n------------------------------\n\nThe core of a ninja's supernatural capabilities comes from their jutsu--meaning, literally, techniques. These use chakra, either projected outwards or used to amplify one's physical performance, to perform feats that woul be literally impossible for a normal person.\n\nThese are divided into three broad categories: taijutsu, ninjutsu, and genjutsu.\n\nTaijutsu, or body techniques, use the chakra flowing throughout a ninja's body to give them the exceptional speed or strength needed to perform the techniques. They are mostly physical attacks. This includes both unarmed combat, and weapon techniques.\n\nNinjutsu, or ninja techniques, use chakra to accomplish what those unfamiliar with them might call magic. These effects range from changing one's appearance to projecting balls of flame, to summoning water from thin air, to healing grievous injuries.\n\nGenjutsu, or illusion techniques, use chakra to either construct illusions in the environment or to directly affect an enemy's mind and confuse their senses. Of the three, they are the most difficult to learn.\n\n====================\n2. Rules\n------------------------------\n\nEach jutsu is a unique action that, once you've learned it, you can perform. All jutsu are divided into five main ranks (E, D, C, B, and A), with S-rank techniques being rare techniques known only to their inventor and perhaps a handful of people that person taught them to.\n\nThough each rank of each type has special requirements to learn (explained in more detail in the relevant sections), a few broad rules apply. For example, to learn ninjutsu of one of the five elements, you need the appropriate Elemental Aptitude ability.\n\nFor the most part, those rules will be explained in the 'Read This!' nodes within each specific subsection.\n\n====================\n3. Reader's Guide\n------------------------------\n\nMost of the jutsu entries have a lot of information packed into them. To help make them easier to read, a lot of the common factors are written using shorthand; for example, rather than spelling out &quot;Using this technique requires you to make a Chakra Exhaustion roll against 10&quot;, a jutsu would have an entry of &quot;Chakra: 10&quot;\n\nBelow are all the common terms you'll see in jutsu entries, and what they mean.\n\n   a.  Stamina:\nThe technique's Stamina cost.\n\n   b.  Chakra:\nThe technique's Chakra cost.\n\n   c.  Upkeep:\nSome techniques require a constant expenditure of your energy to maintain; this is what upkeep represents. So long as you maintain these techniques (which typically can be done indefinitely) you suffer a penalty to all Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to that technique's Upkeep. If you're maintaining multiple techniques with Upkeeps, these penalties stack.\n\nIf your total Upkeep exceeds your total bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls (not counting any penalties), you automatically advance a Fatigue level.\n\nFor example, if you had a Chakra Exhaustion roll modifier of +6+2+10-8, your total bonus would be +18. If you had an Upkeep of 19, your Fatigue would automatically advance a category, giving you another +5, for a total bonus of +23.\n\nYou may end any Upkeeps you're sustaining at will, even when it's not your action.\n\n\n   d.  Damage\nThe base damage dealt by the technique. You add your damage bonus (multiplied by the attack's modified Speed) to this number.\n\n   e.  Accuracy\nSome jutsu have bonuses or penalties to accuracy. If there's no entry for this, it uses your normal accuracy.\n\n   f.  Range\nHow many yards away the attack's target can be. In the case of area-of-effect techniques, they can be centered anywhere within this range (and their effects may well extend beyond it).\n\nThere's one special effect associated with Range: If a ninjutsu technique has a Range of &quot;Touch&quot;, then it is possible to defend against it with an unarmed parry.\n\n   g.  Area\nThe radius, in yards, of area-of-effect techniques. Some may not use simple circular areas, in which case more details will be provided in the description itself.\n\n   h.  Special\nAny special effects the technique has. If a status effect is listed here, it's inflicted automatically.\n\n\n   i.  Speed\nThe jutsu's base Speed.\n\n   j.  Seal Speed\nThe jutsu's base seal speed.\n\n   k.  Effects\nAny special characteristics of a technique which aren't covered by one of the above categories are listed here.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n# Taijutsu \n1. Requirements\n2. Weapon Jutsu\n3. Combos\n  a. Openers\n  b. Combos\n  c. Switching Combos\n  d. Finishers\n\n====================\n1. Requirements\n------------------------------\n\nTaijutsu is more than just hand-to-hand combat; ninjutsu techniques go well beyond the realm of what's possible for normal humans, smashing rocks and the like. It's not exactly... easy.\n\nThere are three ways to qualify to learn a taijutsu technique: the first is your rank in the Athletics skill. If you're in good enough physical condition, you can pull off some pretty impressive things. The second, Research skill rank: sufficient understanding of how the move should be executed allows you to make up for your shortcomings.\n\nFinally, rank: If you're high-enough ranking, you're able to pull enough strings and ask for enough favors to get someone to spare the time to tediously instruct you in how to perform a technique, making up for your own shortcomings.\n\nEach rank has its own requirements, an each method meets them differently.\n\nRank:\nE: Genin\nC: Chuunin, Special Jounin\nB: Jounin\n\nAthletics:\nD: 4\nC: 10\nB: 20\nA: 30\n\nResearch:\nD: 5\nC: 12\nB: 22\nA: 32\n\nThus, if you meet any one of those requirements, you can use the jutsu in question. A Chuunin with 5 Athletics could learn all techniques up to C rank, whereas one with 20 Athletics could learn all techniques up to B rank.\n\n\n====================\n2. Weapon Jutsu\n------------------------------\n\nWeapon jutsu are special techniques which can be performed only while using a specific sort of weapon.\n\nAll weapon jutsu will have a &quot;Type&quot; entry, where they'll listen a certain characteristic, such as Slashing or Sword. Only a weapon which meets these requirements may be used with that technique.\n\nMany of these jutsu will list &quot;As Weapon&quot; in one or more of their entries. For example, if you are using a Stamina 12 weapon, and the technique lists &quot;Stamina: As Weapon +3&quot;, the Stamina cost to use it would be 15.\n\nIf a weapon has a Delay, then any techniques using it also inherit this Delay. For example, using Oak Flight (a technique which normally has no Delay) with a Tetsubo would cause your attack to have Delay 6 (the Tetsubo's normal Delay).\n\nIf a technique has a Delay of, for example, &quot;As Weapon +3&quot;, weapons without a Delay are treated as having a natural Delay 0 (meaning, in that case, the technique would have Delay 3).\n\n\n====================\n3. Combos\n------------------------------\n\nCombos are a special type of unarmed taijutsu attack which benefit from being used in rapid succession. There are three types of taijutsu attacks related to combos: Openers, Combos, and Finishers.\n\n\n   a.  Openers\nOpeners are not, themselves, combo moves. However, after an opener hits, you may launch into a combo (i.e. use a Combo jutsu). Openers are marked as such in their entry, usually by &quot;Special: Opener.&quot;\n\n\n   b.  Combos\nCombo moves indicate as much in their name (typically being named &quot;___ Combo&quot;), or in their 'Special' entry. You cannot use a combo unless the last non-Interrupt action you took was a Combo or Opener; similarly, if your combo is broken (see below), you have to start with a new opener.\n\nWhen you begin a combo, you have a &quot;Combo Counter&quot;--basically, the number of combo moves you've strung together. This starts at 1 when you hit with an opener. Each time you hit with a combo, the combo counter increments by 1.\n\nEach combo will have a combo counter entry; for example, here is Lotus Combo's:\nCombo Counter: +1 Accuracy, +2d10 damage, +1 Stun, +2 Stamina\n\nThis works as might be expected: You multiply those bonuses by the number of combo counters you've amassed. Thus, if you opened with a Kage Buyou and proceeded to a Lotus Combo, the first hit would have +1 Accuracy, +2d10 damage, and +1 Stun (because you're at Combo 1 after the opener); if it hit you'd progress up to Combo 2, and the next combo you used would have +2 Accuracy, +4d10 damage, +2 Stun, and +2 Stamina cost.\n\n\n   c.  Switching Combos\nOnce you've begun a combo, any other combo jutsu is fair game. You could freely alternate between Lion and Lotus combos as you pleased. For the most part, things remain simple. Each move increases your Combo Counter normally, no matter how many times you switch between combo moves.\n\nYour Combo Counter bonuses are based only on the move you're currently using. For example, say you used Kage Buyou as an opener, then 4 Lotus Combos, followed by 3 Lion Combos. This would give you a total Combo of 8 hits (1 + 4 + 3). If your next Combo move was a Lion combo, you'd multiply its CC bonuses (+1 Accuracy and -1 Speed) by 8, giving you a total of +8 Accuracy and -8 Speed (though this would put it at only Speed 5, because it still can't be reduced below half its base Speed).\n\n\n   d.  Finishers\nThe final type of move is finishers. Finishers may be used on their own normally, but have a special effect if used at the end of a combo. Though they do not receive the stacking effects for consecutive combo hits, they have special effects based on your total combo counters.\n\nFor example, the Lion Barrage finisher has the following entry:\nCombo Bonus: +2d10 damage\nFor each combo counter you have when you execute Lion Barrage, its damage is increased by 2d10.\n\n\\page\n\n   e.  Combo Breaking\nWhen a combo is broken, your combo counter is immediately set to 0, you may not continue using combo moves, and all accrued combo counter bonuses are lost.\n\nCombo breaking occurs if any of the following things happen:\n &gt; You take a non-combo, non-interrupt action.\n &gt; You execute a finisher.\n &gt; You attack a new target.\n &gt; Your target takes damage from an attack made by someone else.\n &gt; You take damage from an attack made by someone other than your target.\n &gt; You use any non-combo jutsu (even if it's an interrupt).\n &gt; You are stunned.</text>\n\n### Unarmed Jutsu\n\n## E-Rank\n\n### --( Trip )--\nYou cause an opponent to fall down by knocking their legs out from under them. Calling it a 'technique' is misleading, but there's more to unbalancing a ninja than just wanting to; it does take at least a little bit of training.\n\n  -  Stamina: 8\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Special: +2 Accuracy\n\nEffects:\nIf this hits, your opponent is allowed an Athletics skill as a secondary defense against your Accuracy. This Athletics roll has a +3 bonus for every time that battle they've had to make such a roll to avoid being tripped.\n\nIf they pass, their next action is delayed by 1 but they suffer no other downsides.\n\nIf they fail, they are left prone on the ground. A prone person has -3 Accuracy, -2 to defensive actions, and moves at half speed. Standing back up is a Speed 2 action.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Feint )--\nA subtle trick that almost every ninja knows--and knows how to detect.  Still, those that are particularly adept at it are often difficult to defend against properly.\n\n  - Stamina: X + 2\n  - Speed: X + 2\n\nEffect:\nThis is used alongside any other melee-range unarmed attack, and increases that action's Stamina and Speed by 2 each. Make an opposed Espionage roll; if you beat their result, you've tricked them with your feint.\n\nIf successful, this doubles the Speed of their defensive action for the purpose of determining when they'll act next. This doesn't prevent it from being a valid Interrupt against your attack.</text>\n\n## D-rank\n### --( Teiryuu Dageki - Halting Blow )--\nIn one smooth motion, the user extends their arm and pushed aside an oncoming blow, steps inward and pulls back their forearm to slam their elbow into the opponent, turning their defense into their offense.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Damage: (STR/10)d4\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n\nEffects:\nThis is used as an unarmed parry, with a +3 Accuracy bonus. If you successfully defend, this becomes an attack which uses the result of your parry roll as its Accuracy.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Senpuu - Whirlwind )--\nThe user rotates while extending one leg, starting with a high roundhouse that's used partially as a feint.  Whether it hits or misses, they continue to rotate into a second spin aimed at the lower part of the body.\n\n  -  Stamina: 13\n  -  Damage: (STR/10)d10\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Area: 2\n\nEffects:\nThis attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, this deals 25% damage per point you hit by, rather than 20%.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Houshou - Crushing Fist )--\nUsually considering a rude thing to do to someone, the user slams their fist into their opponent's stomach at an upward angle, knocking the air from their lungs if done properly.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Damage: (STR/10)d8\n  -  Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nIf this hits, it increases the opponent's Stamina penalty by 1, +1 per category of wound it inflicts (2 at Minor, 3 at Major, and so forth).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Reppuu - Gale )--\nWith alarming quickness you drop low to the ground and perform a full 360-degree sweeping kick that knocks opponents off their feet when they attempt to close in for an attack of their own.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Damage: (STR/10)d6\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Special: Interrupt, Opener\n\nEffects:\nThis may be used immediately after you have successfully dodged a melee-range attack. Reppuu is an attack against whoever's action you dodged, and uses your dodge roll as its Accuracy.\n\nAlternately, you may use Reppuu as a normal attack, using your regular Accuracy (rather than a dodge roll).\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Dainamikku Entorii - Dynamic Entry )--\nThis technique is nothing more than a jumpkick at an opponent from hiding.  The hiding part became required because of genin's tendency to shout out things like &quot;HI-YAH!&quot; as they did it.\n\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Damage: (STR/6)d10\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Special: Requires you be hidden from your target.\n\nEffects:\nAfter the first time Dynamic Entry has been used in combat (by you, by someone else, it doesn't matter) it has a -6 Accuracy for the rest of that battle.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shoushitsu - Rising Knee )--\nThe user gets in close and slams their knee into the midsection of their opponent.  While not complex, the pain experienced is enough to make them double over in pain, leaving them vulnerable for a few seconds.\n\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Damage: (STR /10)d10\n  -  Special: Stun 4\n  -  Speed: 16\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Tokken - Thrusting Shoulder )--\nBy charging forward and turning at the last moment to bring a shoulder out front, the user slams into the enemy, knocking them back.  It relies mostly on the weight of the user, with the expectation they'll be heavier than the person they're running into.\n\n  -  Stamina: 12\n  -  Damage: (RES /10)d8\n  -  Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nThis knocks the victim back (your RES)/15 yards.</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### --( Daisenpuu - Great Whirlwind )--\nA more complex version of Senpuu which involves three kicks to the target's body going in the reverse order as before, starting low and going high to end with an axekick to the opponent's head.  The speed and constant rotation is strong enough to actually lift the practitioner into the air during execution.\n\n  -  Stamina: 18\n  -  Damage: (STR /8)d12\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Area: 3\n  -  Requires: Senpuu\n\nEffects:\nThis attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, you deal 1/3 damage per point you hit by, rather than 20%.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Tsutenkyaku - Painful Sky Leg )--\nAfter concentrating chakra in the user's legs, they leap high into the air and come down in a destructive axe kick, using gravity to enhance the momentum behind the blow while the user's chakra is used to enhance the destructive force of the blow.\n\n  -  Stamina: 24\n  -  Damage: (STR /8)d12\n  -  Area: 6\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Special: -6 Accuracy\n\nEffects:\nYour damage bonus is doubled for this attack. Even if it misses, the opponent might still be damaged by the shockwave (and destruction to the environment) the kick causes. For every point it misses by, your damage bonus is reduced by 10%, and its damage is reduced by 2d12.\n\nShould the issue arise, this technique's &quot;shockwave&quot; damage does not work against airborne opponents, including ones who have been rendered so by use of Kage Buyou.\n\n______________________\n\n\\page\n\n### --( Kage Buyou - Shadow of the Dancing Leaf )--\nThe user lowers themself to get underneath their opponent, and then knocks them into the air with a violent rising kick, leaping after them immediately after it to position themselves in the target's shadow.  \n\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Damage: (STR /8)d6\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Special: Opener\n\nEffects:\nIf Kage Buyo hits, and your next action is an unarmed attack against its victim before they've had an action of their own, your attack has its Speed reduced by 5 (not below half its base value) and receives +5 Accuracy.\n\nIf used as the opener of a combo, the Accuracy bonus is reduced to +3 but persists until your combo is broken.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Souji Reppuu - Sweeping Gale )--\nBy flipping forward into a crouch, the user builds momentum that's used to instantly land and begin spinning on one foot, extending the other leg out while using chakra to enhance its density, rotating repeatedly to strike the knees of the enemy, simultaneously evading and tripping them.\n\n  -  Stamina: 16\n  -  Damage: (STR /8)d8\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Requires: Trip, Reppuu\n\nEffects:\nThis follows the rules for the D-rank Reppuu technique. Should you hit, the opponent is knocked prone, as per the E-rank Trip's effects.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Uchikudakute no Jutsu - Shattering Hand Technique )--\nNinja can perform incredible feats of strength; after years of grueling training, some can literally reduce boulders to gravel for their bare fists. That's a handy trick to have, but most ninja aren't willing to go through the whole 'years of pain and hard work' part, so instead they invented a jutsu which accomplishes a similar effect: by channelling vibrating chakra through their hand at the moment of impact, most solid objects can be shattered with a single blow.\n\n  -  Stamina: 20\n  -  Damage: (STR /8)d10\n  -  Speed: 13\n  -  Delay: 5\n\nEffects:\nWhen used against a person, roll location as if it had caused a wound (unless it was a called shot; if blocked, the defender chooses the location as usual). Before wounds or damage are calculated, this completely destroys any armor protecting the location it hits.\n\nIt may also be used against objects, or out of battle, by doubling the Speed, Delay, and Stamina. In this case, it destroys up to STR/10 cubic yards of inanimate objects, such as boulders or trees. For this to work, the material most be contiguous; used against a bridge made from wooden planks, only a single plank would shatter, though a wall held together with mortar would count as contiguous. Additionally, it can only target hard, inflexible materials (i.e. things capable of shattering); rocks are fair game, ropes are not.\n\nTwo things to be aware of when using its secondary function. The first, it  doesn't work against objects which have been reinforced with chakra, such as through means of certain sealing jutsu. The second, it's not nearly as effective as it might sound for &quot;tunnelling&quot; through walls, mountains, and the likes--ten cubic meters of shattered stone is still ten cubic meters of stone, just in small pieces.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Asshou - Pressure Palm )--\nYou deliver a powerful, downwards palm blow to an opponent's stomach or the small of their back, brutally knocking the wind from them and dazing them--repeated use of this can bruise a person's solar plexus, which pretty much hurts more than anything has any right to, for weeks.\n\n  -  Stamina: 24\n  -  Damage: (STR/8)d8\n  -  Special: Stun 12 \n  -  Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nThis may only be used against an opponent who is prone (as from the E-rank Trip). When it hits, they immediately make a Stamina 15 roll.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Spinning Backfist )--\nWith a burst of chakra to one of the user's legs, they spin around and extend an arm to knock an opponent senseless with the back of their fist.  It's a powerful blow as it uses the weight and momentum of the user's entire body, but has an inherent weakness of losing sight of the enemy while spinning.\n\n  -  Stamina: 25\n  -  Damage: (STR/8)d10\n  -  Accuracy: -2\n  -  Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nThis technique's damage is tripled when determining the severity of wounds it inflicts.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Attsu Buchikomu - Pain Driver )--\nA brutal technique, and completely inappropriate for training (because someone would have thought it was okay, if we didn't say that). The attacker finds a weak point on their opponent's body, the site of a previous injury, and strikes there to amplify the existing wound.\n\n  -  Stamina: 20\n  -  Damage: (STR/8)d4\n  -  Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nThis attack must be a called shot, and does not normally inflict wounds. Instead, if it targets a location with a Minor Blunt wound, that wound is removed and replaced with a Major Blunt wound on the same location. This only applies if the attack deals damage.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Maboroshi Tejun - Phantom Step )--\nDespite the fancy name, it's a fairly simple 'technique'. With a momentary burst of energy (and probably adrenaline, considering the circumstances where it's likely to be used) the user does their best to get out of the way of an impending attack. The &quot;phantom&quot; came mostly from the way a shinobi using this can, to the untrained eye, seem almost to disappear. And because ninjas thought it sounded cool.\n\n  -  Stamina: 5 * X\n  -  Speed: +X\n\nEffects:\nThis technique is used alongside a dodge attempt, increasing its Speed by X and providing a +X bonus to your dodge roll, as well as adding a Stamina cost to your dodge. The increased Speed from Phantom Step cannot be reduced.\n\nIf combined with the B-rank Leaping Shadow Evasion this technique increases LSE's Stamina cost by (5*X), which replaces Phantom Step's normal Stamina cost.</text>\n\n## B-rank\n### --( Chouyaku Kage Kaihi no Jutsu - Leaping Shadow Evasion Technique )--\nYou leap away from an attack, getting yourself safely out of range. However, you don't pause to regain your orientation and settle into your new position, instead keeping ready to move again.\n\n  -  Stamina: 20\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 4\n\nEffects:\nWhen you use Chouyaku Kage Kaihi, make a dodge roll. You may automatically attempt to dodge any incoming attacks, without having to take an action to do so, using Chouyaku Kage Kaihi's result as your effective dodge roll. This lasts until you take any action, including defensive interrupts.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Rankyaku - Storm Kick )--\nUsing this technique a shinobi kicks with extreme precision, not aiming at an opponent but instead kicking the air itself. Their leg slices through the air with such speed and precision that it compresses the air into a blade, aimed at the attack's target.\n\n  -  Stamina: 30\n  -  Damage: (STR /6)d6\n  -  Range: (STR/4) yards\n  -  Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nThis cannot be parried (though ninjutsu-based defenses which work like parries still function). Rankyaku causes Slashing wounds. The first time this is used against a given opponent in battle it has a +2 Accuracy bonus.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Gouriki Senpuu - Strong Whirlwind )--\nTaking the Whirlwind back to the basics, the shinobi no longer bothers with a series of strikes, and instead just focuses their ability into a single roundhouse with more speed and power than the previous versions.\n\n  -  Stamina: 32\n  -  Damage: (STR /6)d12\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Area: STR/30\n  -  Requires: Daisenpuu\n\nEffects:\nThis damages everyone in range. If partial defense applies, this technique does 50% of its normal damage per point it hits by, rather than 20%. Anyone hit is knocked back STR/30 yards.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shougekishou - Upwards Attacking Palm )--\nA difficult attack to connect with, the shinobi brings their palm from waist height and strikes upwards to full extension. This makes it exceptionally difficult to connect with, though if the user does hit they'll send their opponent flying away.\n\n  -  Stamina: 34\n  -  Damage: (STR /6 +3)d12\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Accuracy: -6\n  -  Special: Stun 6\n\nEffects: \nIf you are the attacker in a grapple, the Accuracy penalty is negated. The grapple is ended if this technique hits.\n\nAfter being hit the opponent is knocked back (STR/10) yards and left prone, as if they'd been hit with the E-rank Trip move.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Dai Dageki - Heavy Blow )--\nOne of the simplest hand to hand maneuvers at the highest of levels, this attack is straight and to the point. Sacrificing trickery or fancy techniques, you deliver a powerful blow with the full weight of your body behind it.\n\n  -  Stamina: 28\n  -  Damage: As basic Attack (including Power Attack and Unarmed Focus)\n  -  Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nYour damage bonus is doubled for this attack.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Gouken - Iron Fist )--\nA generalized term for one school of thought for how to approach taijutsu, the idea behind 'Iron Fist' is to give every attack one's all, aiming to cause the maximum amount of damage in as few strikes as possible. This often involves thrusting punches and short-range kicks, and is undeniably effective. The downside, however, is that putting all one's force into a single blow results in telegraphing one's motions to an observant opponent, and can quickly tire the user.\n\n  -  Stamina: +X*2\n  -  Accuracy: -X/4 (round up)\n  -  Speed: Special\n\nEffects:\nThis supplements another Unarmed jutsu, or basic taijutsu attack. That attack's base Speed (including for damage calculations) is increased by X, and your Physical Damage Bonus is also increased by X.\n\nX has a maximum of STR/10.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Gawa-Ryuu - River Style )--\nThe ultimate recourse of taijutsu fighters who are frustrated with only being able to land glancing blows on their opponents, this technique sends a surge of chakra through the attacking limb. This results in a burst of speed and strength, and also a chakra 'shockwave' along the edge of the attack that carries almost as much force as the strike itself.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15 + X/2\n\nEffects:\nThis is activated after you hit with an Unarmed or Combo taijutsu attack at melee range, but its damage is reduced by partial defense. X is that technique's Stamina cost, after all modifications.\n\nWhen you activate River Style, your Accuracy with that attack is retroactively increased by 2, or the minimum value to do full damage (i.e. overcome partial defense), whichever is lower.\n\nYour opponent may spend Willpower on their defense after you've declared activation of River Style. If you then spend Willpower on your Accuracy, River Style's effects last until your attack has been fully resolved.</text>\n\n## A-rank\n### --( Chishi Kakato Suto - Deadly Heel Strike )--\nUsed as a killing blow, this technique is commonly performed upon a prone opponent. Leaping into the air, the Shinobi comes down with a full power downward heel strike, usually aiming to smash the ribcage, crush a skull or even snap the spine.\n\n  -  Stamina: 70\n  -  Damage: (STR / 4)d20\n  -  Accuracy: -8\n  -  Speed: 26\n  -  Special: Stun 10\n\nEffects:\nThis attack receives double your normal physical damage bonus. Its Accuracy penalty is negated against a prone opponent.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Okasho - Cherry Blossom Impact )--\nTaking chakra infused muscles to the next level, the user focuses a massive amount of chakra into their fist, foot, or even fingertip. Upon striking the chakra is released into their target causing a great deal of damage. Given that the damage is dependent on the amount of chakra channeled, a truly great shinobi can even use this technique with a single fingertip.\n\n  -  Stamina: 35\n  -  Chakra: X \n  -  Damage: (X)d12\n  -  Speed: 24\n  -  Requires: Chakra Strengthening, Chakra Control 30\n\nEffects:\nOkasho's Speed is multiplied by (your physical damage bonus) + (your ninjutsu damage bonus)/2, rather than just your physical damage bonus. You may give this technique an Area of (X/4), though doing so reduces its damage to (X)d6.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shigan - Finger Gun )--\nUsing a single finger, the Shinobi strikes with speed and precision to drive their finger into an opponents body. There is a danger in the technique as an inaccurate strike can easily damage the user.\n\n  -  Stamina: 50\n  -  Damage: (STR / 4)d6\n  -  Speed: 24\n  -  Special: Bleed 15\n\nEffects:\nShigan's damage is tripled for the purpose of inflicting wounds, and deals Piercing damage. \n\nIf partial defense applies when Shigan hits, the attacker takes half the damage they rolled. Although Shigan cannot wound its user this way, they also suffer a Sprained Arm (Blunt, Major) wound as a result.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Benkei-do - Way of Benkei )--\nA mixture of folk hero and mythical character, Benkei was a warrior monk known for his peerless skill in combat and unswerving loyalty to his master. One of the popular stories about his exploits involved Benkei guarding a bridge, holding back hundreds of warriors before finally succumbing to his wounds. This technique pays homage to his exploits, focusing all a shinobi's efforts on defense.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: +0\n\nEffects:\nYou may activate Way of Benkei alongside a normal defense. Until your next action, your defenses have a (+1+X) bonus, with X being the number of times you've attempted to defend yourself (successfully or otherwise) since activating Way of Benkei (including the defense it was activated with). You may choose not to use Way of Benkei on a given defense; doing so does not reset its X value or require it to be reactivated.\n\nThe only defenses which &quot;count&quot; for Way of Benkei are dodges and unarmed parries. You may use other defenses, but they do not receive its bonus or increase its X value.\n\nWay of Benkei ends when your take a non-Interrupt action, at which point you pay a secondary Stamina cost of 10+3*X, to a maximum of 40. You may declare Block, Total Defense, Guard, and similar effects without ending Way of Benkei.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Asahi Kyusho - Rising Sun Strike )--\nA very impressive, though somewhat impractical, technique, the user gathers energy in one limb (typically a leg, though open-palm attacks are possible) and relases it in a single, swift strike with enough force to send their opponent flying. Though not technically required, it is suggested that anyone performing this technique shout its name emphatically when doing so.\n\nGenerally speaking, the injuries from this technique come less from the initial impact and more from the landing, which is very rarely graceful. Thankfully, the victims of this technique have their dignity spared--they're usually knocked too far away for anyone to see them wind up in a face-down heap after rolling through the dirt!\n\n  -  Stamina: 30 + X/2\n  -  Damage: (STR /4) d6\n  -  Speed: 20, Delay X\n\nEffects:\nThis knocks the target back STR/4 * (its Speed, after any reductions /20) + (Delay)*(your Physical Damage Bonus)/2 yards.\n\nHowever, when Rising Sun Strike hits, make an Athletics roll with a -10 penalty, and a +X bonus, against your opponent's Athletics. If their roll is greater than yours, the distance they're knocked back is halved. For every 5 points they beat your roll by, increase the divisor by 1 (to /3 at 5, /4 at 10, and so on).\n\nAdditionally, if they are knocked back more than (their RES)/3 yards, they lose an amount of AP equal to their current AP, divided by the same amount as the knockback was (someone with current 30 AP who divided the knockback by 4 would lose 7 AP).\n\nRising Sun Strike's damage is considered Y% higher for causing wounds, where Y is the number of yards is target was knocked back.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n# Combo Jutsu\n\n## D-rank\n\n### --( Rendan - Combo )--\nNot so much a proper technique as a catch-all term for any series of attacks made in rapid succession, without breaking one's flow or allowing an opponent time to retreat.\n\n  -  Stamina: 12\n  -  Damage: 1d6\n  -  Speed: 10\n\nCombo Counter: +1d6 damage, -1 Speed\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Yaburi Yashi - Smashing Palm )--\nA single, staggeringly powerful open-palmed blow delivered at the end of a combo, aimed at the opponent's midsection to strike their solar plexus.\n\n  -  Stamina: 16\n  -  Damage: 3d6\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Special: Finisher\n\nCombo Bonus: +2 Stun\n\nEffects:\nThis is an automatic called shot to the abdomen. If it's blocked, the Stun is halved.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Gekido Denka - Furious Charge )--\nThe basis of combos in battle is maintaining one's momentum, striking one blow before the opponent's fully recovered from the one before it. In many cases, all one needs is a few seconds to get away from their opponent and catch their breath to escape an otherwise merciless beating.\n\nYou, however, just love to beat people mercilessly. Though it's taxing, you can keep your adrenaline up, and keep your blows coming rapidly and rhythmically, even after being forced to chase after your victims.\n\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 4\n\nEffects:\nSo long as you maintain Furious Charge, taking Move actions will not break your combos. Using movement-based jutsu (such as Shunshin), however, will.</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### --( Shishi Rendan - Lion Combo )--\nIdeally meant to be used after performing Kage Buyo, this is a series of high-speed punches and kicks.\n\n  -  Stamina: 18\n  -  Damage: 2d8\n  -  Speed: 10\n\nCombo Counter: +1 Accuracy, -1 Speed\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Reikoku Kagai - Relentless Assault )-\nYou get in close to your opponent and begin beating on them! Doing so for a prolonged period of time can easily overwhelm all but the strongest defenses.\n\n  -  Stamina: 16\n  -  Damage: 1d8\n  -  Accuracy: -3\n  -  Speed: 8\n\nCombo Counter: Blocking is 5% less effective, +0.2 damage bonus\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shishi Danmaku - Lion Barrage )--\nA popular way to end the similarly-named combo-assault, the Lion Barrage was is often taught to students along with Lion Combo itself. Advanced taijutsu users, however, have been known to appreciate the flexibility and fluidity that comes from separating the techniques.\n\nThe Lion Barrage is simply a series of fast, strong fist and knee strikes.\n\n  -  Stamina: 25\n  -  Damage: 6d8\n  -  Accuracy: +4\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Special: Finisher\n\nCombos Bonus: +2d8 damage\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Hangeki Rendan - Counter Combo )--\nExploiting a momentary break in your opponent's attacks, you turn the tables on them! It's very exciting, and stuff.\n\n  -  Stamina: 20\n  -  Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nYou and your opponent both make Accuracy rolls. If your result is higher, you immediately break their combo, and execute any combo jutsu you know, with a starting combo counter equal to whatever your opponent's was when you used this technique.\n\nIf you fail, your opponent may immediately use any combo they know against you, as a Speed 0 Interrupt.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Rakurai Heishi - Lightning Warrior )--\nConventional wisdom says that one must prioritize speed or power, having to choose between one or the other. You reject that, striking both quickly and decisively. Of course, that means you have to pay the price elsewhere: fighting like this will rapidly wear a person out.\n\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 0\n  -  Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nWhile Rakurai Heishi is maintained, any time a combo you are performing would be broken you may choose to increase this technique's Upkeep by 2; when you do so, your combo is not broken.\n\nIf your combo is broken, Lightning Warrior's Upkeep is reset to 0. If you stop maintaining Lightning Warrior, your current combo is automatically broken. Rakurai Heishi cannot be used if your combo is broken because you performed a Finisher or a Move action.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Bunka-ken - Splintering Fist )--\nA powerful blow that smashes through defenses. Your attack carries almost concussive force behind it, enough to overcome all but the most resilient of enemies.\n\n  -  Stamina: +5\n  -  Speed: +4\n  -  Special: Finisher\n\nCombo Bonus: Ignore 5 points of DR.\n\nEffects:\nThis is applied as an addition to an Unarmed Taijutsu technique, increasing its Stamina and Speed accordingly and turning it into a Finisher. The increased Speed does not improve the technique's damage.</text>\n## B-rank\n### --( Hasu Rendan - Lotus Combo )--\nThe user of this technique launches into a sequence of strikes designed to alternately wind, disorient, and daze their opponent, combining those effects to prevent their adversary from fighting back effectively for as long as possible.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Damage: 2d10\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Special: Opener. This action's Speed may not be reduced.\n\nCombo Counter: +2d10 damage, +2 Stamina, +1 Accuracy\n\nEffects:\nEach time Lotus is used sequentially (with no other attacks between uses), its base Speed increases by 2, its Stamina cost is raised by 4, and it gives an additional 1 Combo Count. This stacks; the fourth Lotus in a sequence would be Speed (4+2*3) 10, give (1 + 1*3) 4 Combo Counters, and have a Stamina cost of 22 (before Combo Counter effects).\n\nAdditionally, Lotus Combo can extend existing stuns. If a target hit by Lotus Combo is Stunned, the duration of that Stun is increased by X*2, with X being the length of the current Lotus sequence. Thus, hitting someone with four Lotus Combos in a row would extend their stun by (2+4+6+8) 20.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Hokuto no Ken - Fist of the North Star )--\nDelivering a precise, rapid, and powerful series of blows to vital points on an opponent's body, this causes their blood vessels to spontaneously rupture, resulting in both internal hemorrhaging and dramatic external bleeding, sometimes even resulting in a brief spray of blood immediately after its use.\n\n  -  Stamina: 30\n  -  Damage: 7d10\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Special: Finisher\n\nCombo Bonus: +1d10 damage, +1 Bleed\n\nEffects:\nEven if Hokuto no Ken is parried, it still inflicts its Bleed.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Aragami no Jutsu - God of Battle Technique )--\nRather than waiting for your opponents to give you openings and then capitalizing upon them, you make openings. When that doesn't work, you break through your opponent's defenses anyway, attacking even when it seems fruitless, until finally something gives.\n\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 0\n  -  Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nWhenever you hit with a technique that raises your Combo Counter, your Combo Counter increases by 1 more, and Aragami's Upkeep also increases by 2. When your combo is broken, Aragami's Upkeep is reset to 0.\n\nIf you end Aragami, your Combo Counter is immediately set to 0.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Mouretsu Tora no Jutsu - Furious Tiger Technique )--\nYou break off your combo with an abrupt transition back into more traditional taijutsu techniques, taking advantages of the momentum and rhythm you've built up to deliver one devastating blow.\n\n  -  Stamina: +10\n  -  Speed: +6\n  -  Special: Finisher\n\nCombo Bonus: +0.5 Accuracy, +5% damage\n\nEffects:\nThis finisher is used by combining it with an Unarmed Taijutsu attack, increasing its Stamina cost appropriately. The Combo Bonuses are applied to that technique, modifying it appropriately.\n\nThe increased Speed from using Furious Tiger does not improve the technique's damage.</text>\n## A-rank\n### --( Akuma no Isoi - Devil's Rush )--\nA technique that requires extreme speed and toughness, and a considerable disregard for one's own health. Most shinobi learn first-hand in the academy what 'chakra burns' are: burns, typically found on the hands (where chakra is typically focused), caused by poorly forcing too much of one's chakra through their body's &quot;chakra pores&quot;.\n\nThis technique takes a common mistake among academy students and weaponizes it, forcibly overwhelming one's own chakra circulatory system in the arms and hands, superheating their body. That, combined with the high-speed blows delivered by this technique, results in what appear to be literally flaming punches.\n\nThis can actually be delivered in kicks as well, and the general consensus is that a 'burning' leg is more visually impressive. Most ninja, however, prefer punches, because they hate fun.\n\n  -  Stamina: 25\n  -  Damage: 2d6.open(6)\n  -  Speed: 10\n\nCombo Counter: +1d6 damage, +1 Ignite\n\nEffect: \nIf an enemy passes a Resistance roll against your Athletics, the severity of the ignite they're inflicted with is halved. Whether or not you hit, you yourself suffer Burns with a severity equal to Akuma no Isoi's Ignite.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Taiyou Douyou no Jutsu - Solar Agitation Technique )--\nFor once, the name actually has a basis in reality! This technique is a single, devastating blow to the opponent's solar plexus, knocking the wind from their lungs and temporarily debilitating them in the aftermath.\n\n  -  Stamina: 40\n  -  Damage: 8d12\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Special: Finisher\n\nCombo Bonus: +3 Stun, +1 to enemy's Stamina penalty, +1d12 damage\n\nEffects:\nThis has an additional feature if used against an opponent who was performing handseals. If the total Stun from Solar Agitation is greater than the Speed of their Perform Handseals action, the victim automatically Aborts their Perform Handseals action (as if they had failed the Chakra Control roll against the attack's damage dealt).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Senkagami no Jutsu - God of War Technique )--\nThe greatest of hand-to-hand combatants are able to dispatch enemies one after another in the midst of battle, their momentum never lagging, their blows not showing the slightest hint of hesitation.\n\nIf you've mastered this technique, you are officially one of them! Congratulations!\n\n  -  Stamina: +5\n  -  Upkeep: 0\n  -  Speed: +0\n\nEffects:\nThis is used alongside a Finisher. Using that Finisher does not end your combo; instead, your Combo Counter is halved, but you may continue your combo, make another finisher, or so forth. If your Finisher missed and you activated Senkagami, your Combo Counter does not decrease at all.\n\nAfter using a finisher with Senkagami applied, you gain an Upkeep of 5 from Senkagami; each subsequent use increases Senkagami's Upkeep by 5 (10 after the second use, 15 afte the third, and so forth). When your combo is broken, Senkagami's Upkeep ends; similarly, if you end Senkagami's Upkeep, your combo ends automatically.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n# Grappling Jutsu\n## E-rank\n### --( Grab )--\nYou grab onto an opponent, with the intent to not let go! It's not a preferred method of fighting among ninja, but it does have some limited popularity amongst certain taijutsu fighters.\n\n  -  Stamina: 8 if it misses, 12 if it hits\n  -  Damage: None\n  -  Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nYou are grappling your opponent. This is not inherently a huge advantage, but leads in to multiple other possibilities for attack.\n\nWhen grappled, the following effects apply to both participants:\n  <BR>  &gt; Their movement speed is halved, and moves the other person along with them.\n  <BR>  &gt; If you try to move, the other person may attempt to restrain you; if they do, your AGI is reduced by half their STR when calculating how far you can move.\n  <BR>  &gt; The Dodge and Parry interrupt both have their Speed increased by 2.\n  <BR>  &gt;  Other Grapple jutsu may be used. Grapple jutsu cannot be defended against normally (i.e. dodging, blocking). Ordinary attacks, such as punching or stabbing the other grappler, can be defended against normally.\n  <BR>  &gt; The attacker cannot use handseals without the Single-Handed Seals unique.\n  <BR>  &gt; If either person is suffering from the Ignite status, both people take damage from it. If both are on fire, only the more severe Ignite deals damage.\n\nCertain situations within a grapple may call for a 'grapple check'. This varies depending on whether you are the attacker or defender.\nAttacker: 1d20 + STR/10 + DEX/20\nDefender: 1d20 + STR/10 + AGI/20\n\nThe person who initiated the grapple is considered the 'attacker', and may end it at will, at any time; the person who was grabbed is the 'defender', and may not.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, all Grapple Jutsu may only be used by the attacker. However, the defender has two options (beyond normal actions and attacks) available to them:\n\nShift Grapple (Speed 5, Stamina 5)\nThe attack and defender both roll grapple checks; if the defender exceeds the attacker's roll, they are the new attacker in the grapple. When this is done, the attacker also has to roll a Stamina 5 check.\n\nBreak Grapple (Speed 4)\nThe attack and defender both roll grapple checks; if the defender matches or exceeds the attacker's roll, the grapple ends immediately. When this is done, the attacker must roll a Stamina 5 check, or choose to simply let go.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Escape Grapple )--\nBeing held in place by one person and then punched into submission by all their friends is a pretty exceptionally undignified way for a ninja to go down. Accordingly, ninja are usually taught the basics of how to writhe their way out of all manner of holds.\n\n  -  Stamina: 4 + X\n  -  Speed: 4 + X, Delay X\n  -  Special: Grapple-only.\n\nEffects:\nRoll a grapple check against your opponent. The &quot;X&quot; in this jutsu's cost and speed is the amount you fail your grapple check by.\n\nThus, if you rolled a 12 against your opponent's 16, Escape Grapple would be a Stamina 8 check and have a Speed of 8. On the other hand, if you passed your check by 36 points, it would be only Stamina 4 and Speed 4.\n\nThis technique cannot be Aborted, despite its Delay.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Headbutt )--\nYou use your head to hit someone else's head. Really, honestly, it's a highly technical process. You just don't understand because you're not a ninja.\n\n  -  Stamina: 5\n  -  Damage: 3d8\n  -  Speed: 7\n  -  Special: Grapple-only\n\nEffects:\nThis attack may be used by either the attacker or the defender in the grapple, but only against the other person. It automatically hits. If it causes a wound, that wound is automatically a head wound.\n\nAlthough the attacker does not take damage from doing this, if the damage they do would have caused them to be wounded, they will suffer that wound. For example, if you have 500 Vitality and Headbutt someone for 60 damage, you would take 0 damage and suffer a minor wound (for taking more than 10% of your HP in one hit).</text>\n## D-rank\n### --( Throw )--\nYou use leverage, brute force, or a combination of the two to physically throw an enemy, either by flipping them over you, hurling them into a nearby object, slamming them to the ground, or something similar.\n\n  -  Stamina: 12\n  -  Damage: 4d6\n  -  Speed: 8, or +4\n\nEffects:\nThis immediately ends the grapple, and Stuns the enemy, severity 4. This can also be declared as part of a Grab attack, in which case it increases the total Speed by 4, and deals damage as a Speed 16 action. It cannot be blocked when used this way. The two Stamina rolls (one for a grab, and one for Throwing if the grab succeeds) are made separately.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Arm Lock )--\nYou use one of your hands or arms to pin an opponent's in a position where they can't use it effectively. It's a bit harder than it sounds, just because of the logistics of grappling people effectively.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nYou and your opponent both lose the ability to use one of your arms. This puts your opponent at a -1 immobilization penalty, applies a -2 penalty to their grapple rolls, and doubles the Seal Speed of any jutsu they try to use.\n\nUsing this jutsu a second time doubles the penalties and makes it impossible for the victim to use handseals at all.\n\nIf you lose control of the grapple, these effects end.\n\nA person with the Single-Handed Seals unique is able to perform handseals one-handed unhindered by these effects.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Leg Lock )--\nYou hook one of your legs around an opponent's, restricting their mobility at the price of your own.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nYou and your opponent both lose the ability to use one of your legs. This gives your opponent a -2 penalty both to immobilization and to their grapple checks, as well as further halving the speed at which you and they can move in the grapple.\n\nWith both their legs locked, the penalties double and neither you nor they can move at all.\n\nIf you lose control of the grapple, these effects end.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Head Lock )--\nYou get behind an opponent and put an arm around their neck. For what's a fairly simple-seeming maneuver, this is actually highly effective: to avoid breaking their own neck, they have to limit their mobility.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nYou lose the ability to use one of your arms, and your opponent suffers a -4 immobilization penalty, as well as a -2 penalty to all their grapple rolls. For the duration of the headlock, the victim's Stamina rolls have a -4 penalty. Additionally, any jutsu or effects that require them to aim with their mouth (such as breathing fire or spitting out needles) have a -5 strike penalty.\n\nIf you lose control of the grapple, these effects end.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Choke Hold )--\nYou grab your opponent's neck and cut off either the flow of blood to their brain, or of oxygen to their lungs. Either way, it's a nasty thing to be affected by... though as far as combat between ninjas go, it's one of the more effective and less violent ones.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Speed: 5\n\nEffects:\nYou lose the ability to use one of your arms while maintaining this hold. Every use of this technique applies a stacking -1 Suffocation penalty to your opponent. So long as this hold is maintained (meaning you don't use the arm holding them for anything else, and remain in control of the grapple) the suffocation effect does not end.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Reversal )--\n\n  -  Stamina: 4, +X if successful\n  -  Speed: 3 + Special\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n\nEffects:\nThis can interrupt the use of any grapple move other than Headbutt or Pressure Point while you're the defender, as long as you know that jutsu yourself. Make a grapple roll against the attacker; if you succeed you gain control of the grapple and automatically use the move they were going to; the 'X' in Reversal's Stamina cost is that move's Stamina.\n\nReversal's Speed is 3 if it fails, and for the purpose of determining what it can interrupt. If it succeeds, you also add half the Speed of the move you reversed.\n\n______________________</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### --( Counter Throw )--\nYou throw an enemy who's grabbing you off, freeing yourself from them and injuring them in the process.\n\n  -  Stamina: 8 + X\n  -  Damage: 4d6\n  -  Speed: 4 + X, Delay X\n  -  Requires: Throw\n\nEffects:\nThis ends a grapple when used, but may only be used by the defender. The attacker is Thrown (as per the D-rank Throw move, including the stun). Counter Throw always deals damage as if it was Speed 10, regardless of the actual speed.\n\nWhen you declare use of Counter Throw, make an opposed Grapple check. The amount you fail by is the &quot;X&quot; in this move's Stamina cost and Speed. If you pass, it's Stamina 8 / Speed 4 / Delay 0.\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Joint Lock )--\nYou grab your opponent in such a way that you can put continual strain on one of their limbs or joints. Though typically non-lethal, an expert grappler can be brutal with these techniques.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Damage: Basic unarmed attack.\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Special: Must have the opponent in an Arm Lock or Leg Lock.\n\nEffects:\nTo use this technique you must have your opponent in an arm or leg lock; if you have multiple limbs locked, declare which one you are targeting. Any wounds dealt by the joint lock are applied to that limb.\n\nAlthough the damage is dealt normally, it is considered cumulatively 25% higher each time you use the technique. For example, the first Joint Lock you apply does unarmed damage +25%; the next, unarmed damage +50%; the third +75%, and so forth, and so on.\n\nIf you take an action other than maintaining the joint lock (including moving or using interrupts), this cumulative increase is reset.\n\nJoint Lock does benefit from Unarmed Focus and Power Focus, if you have those abilities, though its Stamina cost is increased appropriately (up to 18 for four ranks of Power Attack).\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Pressure Point )--\nYou find, grab, and press down on an opponent's pressure point, temporarily immobilizing them; these are painful while maintained, but more to the point (ahaha, get it, because they're... never mind) it prevents the nerves you're isolating from working properly while the pressure is maintained.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10 + X*4\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Requires: Medicine 10\n\nEffects:\nThis may be used to Interrupt any grapple move used by the defender, other than Headbutt or Break Grapple checks (Shift Grapple and Escape Grapple are fair game). You quickly find a pressure point on their body and immobilize it, preventing them from completing whatever they were attempting.\n\nThis requires an arm free; you may release a lock, if necessary, as part of this interrupt, to free up your hand. Roll an opposed grapple check, applying no penalties from holds or locks. If you are successful, they are prevented from taking their action.\n\nAgainst Escape Grapple or Counter Throw (or any techniques with similar variable effects), the &quot;X&quot; value the user pays for their failed technique is half the amount you beat their roll by.\n\nFor Pressure Point's cost, X is the number of times you've used Pressure Point in that battle--making it 10 the first time, 12 the second, and so on.\n\n______________________ \n\n\n### --( Compression Hold )--\nA less brutal alternative to joint locking (which has this nasty tendency to tear people apart), a compression hold is still exceptionally painful--that's the point. You twist the victim's body in such a way that their own joints are being used to hurt them--forcing their elbow to press against their sternum is a popular one.\n\n  -  Stamina: 6\n  -  Speed: 3\n\nEffects:\nThis requires the opponent already be in one of the three D-rank locks. Each time you use this technique applies a -1 penalty to their grapple checks, so long as that lock is maintained. This penalty remains until that lock is ended.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Suplex )--\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex\nJust... read that, okay? That's what you do to them.\n\n  -  Stamina: 13\n  -  Damage: 6d12\n  -  Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nThis ends the grapple. If Suplex inflicts a wound, it is dealt to the opponent's head.</text>\n\n## B-rank\n### --( Kurokumaken - Black Bear Strength )--\nA devastating move, developed by a shinobi who claimed he had gained inspiration for it by watching the fighting tactics of wild bears. The user wraps their arms around their opponent and squeezes with incredible strength. Users of this move have been known to crack arm bones and break ribs.\n\nIt was later pointed out that real bears do not actually hug people, to death or otherwise. The original inventor of the move refused to comment, and the name was in wide use by that point anyway.\n\n  -  Stamina: 30\n  -  Damage: 10d12\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Requires: Compression Hold\n\nEffects:\nIf this causes a wound, that wound is applied to the torso and both arms. Additionally, your damage bonus is doubled for calculating the damage of this move. Kurokumaken requires the use of both arms.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Ryuorosu - Dragon Takedown )--\nAdapted--in purpose, method, and name--from a 'normal' style of martial arts, the Dragon Takedown is a more aggressive method of initiating a grapple, often throwing an opponent to the ground in the process.\n\n  -  Stamina: 18\n  -  Damage: (STR/5)d4\n  -  Speed: 16\n\nEffects:\nThis may be used outside of a grapple; in fact, it may only be used outside of a grapple. If you hit, you deal damage (which is not unblockable) and you initiate a grapple with your opponent and may immediately apply any of the D-rank locks or a choke hold.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Tora Rakka - Tiger Drop )--\nYou flip your opponent over you and hurl them to the ground (or otherwise maneuver them unpleasantly if you're both already on the ground) and slam an elbow, knee, or other body part into them, using gravity to assist your momentum.\n\nNobody really knows what this has to do with tigers.\n\n  -  Stamina: 24\n  -  Damage: (STR/5)d12\n  -  Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nWhen you use this technique, make an opposed grapple check. If the opponent fails, they are Stunned (10). If you fail, you are instead Stunned for that amount; if you succeed, you are still Stunned (4). This technique ends the grapple.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Hijutsu: Full Nelson - Secret Technique: Full Nelson )--\nA special technique passed down through generations, the true origin of the Full Nelson is unknown, but its efficiency is dreaded; many a shinobi has thought victory assured, only to be trapped by a well-timed Full Nelson.\n\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nYou must use both your arms to keep your opponent in this hold. So long as you do so, they have a -8 immobilization penalty and a -8 penalty to their grapple rolls. This ends if you lose control of the grapple.</text>\n\n## A-rank\n### --( Shishi Keishi - Lion Execution )--\nThis move was supposedly developed by a martial arts master who was tackled and mauled by a lion. He somehow survived, though horribly maimed; it's said that because nobody could recognize him after the attack, he became known as the &quot;Faceless Master.&quot; He devised this technique based on what he learned from being tackled and mauled by a lion, to imitate the effects of the victim being tackled and mauled by a lion.\n\n  -  Stamina: X + 10\n  -  Speed: X + 6\n  -  Requires: Dragon Takedown\n\nEffects:\nShishi Keishi is performed from outside of a grapple. If this technique misses, the &quot;X&quot; value is not paid. When performing Shishi Keishi, declare any grapple move of B rank or below; if it hits, you initiate a grapple and then immediately perform that move. &quot;X&quot; is the cost and speed of the move you are using with Shishi Keishi.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Garuda Tsuiraku no Jutsu - Crashing Garuda Technique )--\nThe Crashing Garuda is not, at a glance, all that different from a regular flip-your-opponent-over-a-shoulder throw. What makes it different, and what makes it take arduous practice to perfect, is the precise way the user manipulates their opponent and strains their muscles. The Crashing Garuda is a study in kinesiology--the user lifts the opponent overhead and swings them down, bringing themselves crashing along with the foe in a way that multiplies the force brought to bear by both muscles and gravity.\n\nToo long? Didn't read? The short version: You don't want to have this used against you.\n\n  -  Stamina: 28\n  -  Damage: 16d10\n  -  Speed: 18, Delay 14\n  -  Requires: Tora Rakka\n\nEffects:\nMake a grapple check. The amount you succeed by is added to this technique's Speed for the purpose of determining its damage, the opponent is Stunned for half that amount, and you are Stunned for one quarter that amount. If you fail, you still pay the Stamina cost and expend the full Speed, but the attack fails.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Washitsume no Jutsu - Eagle Talon Technique  )--\nThe pinnacle of ways to brutally maim your opponents when you already have them at your mercy in battle, Washitsume is yet another move named after animals for no clear reason other than martial artists (and ninjas) seeming to think that's cool.\n\nThe principle is simple: You hyperextend a limb or joint while twisting it in whatever way will put the most excessive amount of strain on the bones, muscles, and tendons. It's quite possible for this to cause irreparable damage, and it has seen some use as an improvised torture method.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10 + X * 4\n  -  Damage: Basic unarmed damage.\n  -  Speed: 8 + X * 2\n\nEffects:\nYou must have your opponent in a joint lock for the limb you are attacking. After reductions are applied, this attack's actual damage is halved. However, for the purpose of causing wounds its original damage is multiplied by X, up to a maximum of 6. The X*2 is not included when calculating your damage bonus from Speed.</text>\n\n\\page\n# Weapon Jutsu\n## D-rank\n### --( Kousanami - Cross Wave )--\nA simple but elegant technique, the user brings their weapon up in a sequence of diagonal slashes.  It gets its name from the rising swings and the figure-eight motion which is both efficient and simple to perform.\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon + 4\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: 15 + (weapon's Speed)/2\n  -  Type: Sword or Slashing\n\nEffects:\nCross Wave has only a single Accuracy, and is treated as one attack. However, if the opponent uses a defense where they roll for a result (such as dodge or parry), they must roll twice.\n\nIf the attack hits the first defense, that roll is used to determine how much partial defense, if any, is applied. If the second defense also fails (partial defense being ignored for this purpose), your attack's dice damage is tripled (from, for example, 5d8 to 5d8*3).\n\nIf the attack misses against your opponent's first defensive roll, make the second roll. If it hits, this attack deals damage as a regular attack with your weapons (with the higher Speed associated with this technique).\n\nIf you are using a two-handed weapon (such as a nodachi or zanbato), which would normally multiply your damage bonus by 50%, you do not receive that increase when using Cross Wave. For example, if you had a damage bonus of 10, normally a two-handed sword would use 15; for Cross Wave, however, it would use the normal 10.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Nenten Tsuki - Twisting Stab )--\nThe user lunges forward while turning their wrist, drilling their weapon into the opponent, using chakra to enhance their momentum.  It is very effective at breaking an opponent's guard as you spin the weapon to go around their defense.\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon +2\n  -  Accuracy: -1\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: 12 + (Weapon's Speed)/5\n  -  Type: Piercing\n\nEffects:\nThis technique reduces the effectiveness of blocking by an additional 25% (for a total of  50%, for attacking with a weapon). If you miss completely, the Speed is increased by 3, as you lunge and lose your balance.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kashiwa no Hishou - Oak Flight )--\nCircling something large and blunt over your head, you slam it into your opponent after a few rotations and completely daze them. A powerful enough strike put in the right place makes it hard for the enemy to focus on you, or even gives them a bit of double-vision.\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon +5\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: As Weapon +5\n  -  Type: Blunt\n\nEffects:\nEvery 50 damage dealt by this technique gives the victim a -1 penalty to Accuracy which lasts until their next attack or accuracy roll.\n\nIf you deal more than 400 damage, for 50 IC whenever they attack any single target they must roll 1d2; on 1, their attack functions normally. On 2, they have a -5 Accuracy penalty due to disorientation and double vision.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Haganekabe - Steel Wall )--\nBy spinning their weapon rapidly with both hands, the user deflects ranged attacks aimed at them as they close in on their opponents, and then use the momentum gained by the rotation to finish with a powerful swing.\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon +6\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: As Weapon -2\n  -  Type: Polearm, Umbrella\n\nEffects:\nWhen you use this technique, you begin spinning your weapon; so long as you keep doing this you may parry incoming ranged attacks as a Speed 0 Interrupt with a +5 bonus, but both your hands and your weapon are occupied. Anyone attempting to attack you in melee has their action's Speed increased by 4, as they need to get around your polearm.\n\nWhen in melee range of someone, you may end this technique's upkeep and pay its cost and Speed again to use it as an attack, with +3 Accuracy.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Ichi no Hoshi - One Star )--\nBy unfolding their fan only a third of the way, the user creates a small but biting gust of wind that is useful for its capacity to strike at targets far away while wielding a weapon.\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: As Weapon\n  -  Range: CHA/5\n  -  Type:  Fan\n\nEffects:\nThis uses your ninjutsu damage bonus, rather than your physical damage bonus.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Fukumikuchi Hari - Hidden Mouth Needles )--\nThe user is able to summon needles from within their mouth and spit them at their opponents with force comparative to have been thrown.  It's useful at point-blank range for catching the opponent by surprise, but becomes predictable with repeated use.\n\n  -  Stamina: As senbon multi-throw, +3\n  -  Chakra: 10, +X\n  -  Damage: As senbon multi-throw\n  -  Speed: As senbon multi-throw, -2\n  -  Type: Senbon\n\nEffects:\nThis allows you to perform a multi-throw with senbon, following normal multi-throw rules, even without the ability which would normally allow you to do so. If you can multi-throw senbon without using this jutsu, it instead becomes an automatic Surprise Attack.\n\nX is the number of times you have previously used this technique in the same battle.\n\nThough this jutsu can be used as often as you wish, it may only be used as a Surprise Attack once every 100 IC; after that, it's just not surprising.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kage Shuriken no Jutsu - Shadow Shuriken Technique )--\nThe user throws multiple Shuriken at the same time, positioning them in such a way that one or more weapons can hide within the shadow of another in flight, making the lower one(s) virtually invisible.\n\n  -  Stamina: 22\n  -  Damage: As Weapon(s)\n  -  Speed: 22\n  -  Type:  Large Ranged Weapon\n\nEffects:\nYou throw two of the same weapon, each doing their normal base damage, and using half this technique's Speed to determine how much they benefit from your damage bonus.\n\nIf this hits and partial defense does not apply, combine the damage of the two weapons. If it hits and partial defense does apply, one misses entirely and the other does full damage (not reduced by partial defense).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Mukadesuto - Centipede Strike )--\nUsing two weapons in conjunction with one another, the user strikes repeatedly, flowing from one strike to the next in a barrage of attacks that can quickly overwhelm most opponents.\n\n  -  Stamina: As Dual-Wield Attack, +3\n  -  Damage: As Dual-Wield Attack\n  -  Speed: As Dual-Wield Attack +2\n  -  Type: Dual\n\nEffects:\nEach time this attack is consecutively used (even if it misses!) the total Speed of the attack is reduced by 1, to a minimum of half its original value. Additionally, the number of dice on each weapon is increased by 1.\n\nThese benefits reset if you make a non-Interrupt action other than a dual-wielded attack with your weapons or movement, or if you go for 15 IC or more without using this jutsu.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kusari no Hebi - Chain Serpent )--\nWith sufficient practice, the user can throw their chain weapon in such a way that it ricochets to strike their opponent multiple times, hitting and disarming them or tripping them at the same time, tugging on the chain to redirect it.\n\n  -  Stamina: 16\n  -  Range: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: +4\n  -  Type: Chain Weapon\n\nEffects:\nIf this hits, in addition to dealing damage you may either attempt to perform the E-rank taijutsu technique Trip or disarm a weapon they're holding. The Stamina costs and Speds of these actions are included in this technique.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Omo Hoshiga - Double Star Fang ) --\nSeveral enemies running at an archer and getting in close could mean the end for an archer, but luckily you can fend them off! Quickly drawing several arrows out, you load them all into your bow and fire them off in different directions. This would be hard for most people, but luckily you're a ninja. \n\n  -  Stamina: (As Weapon) + 5 * X\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Range: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: (As Weapon) + 3 * X\n  -  Type: Bow\n\nEffects:\nYou may target up to three additional people with this attack; X is the number of people beyond the first who you attack.\n\n\\page\n\n_________________\n\n### --( Soushuriken no Jutsu - Manipulated Shuriken Technique )--\nYou connect a thin, nearly invisible wire to shuriken or kunai when throwing them so that you can redirect them mid-air, or even attack people around corners or behind trees!\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon +3\n  -  Damage: As Weapons\n  -  Speed: As Weapon +3\n  -  Type: Small Thrown Weapons\n  -  Requires: Ninja Wire\n\nEffects:\nIf you miss with this technique you can make an Accuracy roll with a +4 bonus; if this hits, your attack hits but uses only half your damage bonus.\n\nYou can also attack a person who you don't have line of sight on (say, they're around a corner) if you can somehow accurately perceive them; in this case the above paragraph does not apply and this technique has a -2 Accuracy penalty.\n\nUsed with a multi-throw attack, this increases the total Stamina and Speed of that action by the appropriate amount. The increase in damage bonus from multi-throwing (+0.5 per weapon thrown) is also halved by this technique if the Accuracy roll is used.\n\nThe total of Ninja Wire required is the range at which you make this attack, multiplied by the number of weapons thrown. This does not need to be prepared in advance; you do it on the spot and use precisely the right amount of wire, via your ninja trickery.</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### --( Hirameku Yaiba - Flash Blade )--\nUsing the principles of Iaijutsu, the user takes up a neutral stance and, using a surge of chakra, rushes their opponent to take them by surprise, redrawing the weapon and striking in one quick movement.\n\n  -  Stamina: +5\n  -  Speed: +4\n  -  Requires: Sword\n\nEffects:\nMake an Initiative roll, opposed by your opponent's; they have a cumulative +2 bonus for each time you've used this (successfully or not) in this battle. If you fail, you perform a regular sword attack.\n\nIf you succeed, your attack receives the benefits of the Iaijutsu ability, even if you've used that earlier in battle.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Hamukau Kanjin - Vital Strike )--\nWhether it be to cut someone's achilles tendon, or to lop their head off, blades have many ways to disable or execute their wielder's opponents. Sneaking into your opponents defenses and getting in even one good attack can change a fight, or end a life!\n\n  -  Stamina: +8\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: As Weapon +5\n  -  Requires: Slashing weapon\n\nEffects:  \nYou may give yourself a penalty of up to -(STR/10) Accuracy. For every -1, this attack's damage is increased by 10% for the purposes of inflicting wounds.\n\nEven without any penalty, partial defenses are ineffective against this attack, and it is an automatic called shot (without the usual called shot penalty).\n\n__________________\n\n### --( Mawarisuto - Rotation Strike )--\nExtending out a polearm, you hold one end with both hands then commence whirling and spinning the polearm around yourself in large circles! If it has a blade of some sort, this is even better!!\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: As Weapon +10\n  -  Requires: Polearm\n\nEffects:  \nYou may attack anyone you choose within range 3. If you choose to target only one person with this attack it has +2 Accuracy.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Raikogeki - Thundering Strike )--\nDrawing your weapon back and then lunging out quickly, you make a precise strike aiming to injure, hopefully cause them to bleed out a bit. Despite the slightly weakened nature of this strike, it's rather unnerving to be poked full of holes.\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon +2\n  -  Damage: As Weapon \n  -  Speed: As Weapon -5 (Minimum 3)\n  -  Requires: Piercing Weapon\n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts Bleed 1. If used again while the opponent is still suffering from that status, this instead increases the Bleed's severity by 1.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kashiraheki - Headsplitter )--\nHoisting your weapon into the perfect position, taking your time to figure out the perfect swing, you bring it across directly into your target, or perhaps from above, with disastrous results! Unfortunately, while this may be perfect for exploding someone's brains out, it's pretty obvious you ar .getting ready to do just that!\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon +10\n  -  Accuracy: -3\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: As Weapon +5\n  -  Delay: As Weapon +3\n  -  Type: Blunt Weapon\n\nEffects:  \nThis technique counts as 10 Speed higher if you miss with it. \n\nIts total damage (dice + speed*damage bonus) is multiplied by 2. If used with a two-handed weapn, the increased damage bonus for holding it in both hands has a maximum of *1.5 (this will normally only be relevant if performing Headsplitter with a Tetsubo).\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Motsure Muchi - Entangling Lash )--\nInstead of using the chain to strike at people from range and then reel the weapon back to the user, they disable their opponent with the length of chain, preventing them from moving at the expense of losing use of their weapon.\n\n  -  Stamina: 16\n  -  Range: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Type: Chain Weapon\n\nEffects:\nYou may use your weapon to grab ahold of someone, as per the E-rank Grapple technique. You use your DEX in place of your STR for grapple checks using the whip. Your opponent is considering to be 'grabbing' the whip. Although they cannot attack it, if they gain control they may automatically disarm you. The victim may shift or break the grapple as normal.\n\nYou may perform any valid Grapple techniques which you know of D-rank or lower, using your DEX in place of your STR. Yoou may not perform the Headbutt or Suplex techniques.\n\nWhile being used in a grapple, your whip cannot be used to attack or with other jutsu.\n\n__________________\n\n### --( Ni no Hoshi - Two Star )--\nOpening the fan two-thirds of the way for this attack, the user lets out a strong gust of wind, hopefully blowing their opponents away!\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Range: CHA/4\n  -  Speed: As Weapon +5\n  -  Type: Fan\n\nEffects:\nThis uses your ninjutsu damage bonus, plus half your physical damage bonus.\n\n__________________\n\n### --( Jouro Senbon - Raining Needles )--\nThis technique requires an umbrella and a plethora of needles! Filling them all into tiny spring-loaded compartments, they all fire out as the umbrella is thrown into the air, spinning. The user helps direct the needles with their chakra, though only enough to make sure the needles spread out well or hit their targets.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Damage: As Weapons\n  -  Area: 50\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Type: Needles, Umbrella (Set up beforehand)\n\nEffects:\nYour umbrella is launched into the air, where it remains stationary. When first launched, and every 10 IC afterwards, for 50 IC, the umbrella showers the area with needles. You may selectively choose who's targeted by this technique with each volley, allowing you to exclude your allies.\n\nEach 'needle shower' is a senbon multi-throw, up to the max number of senbon you can multi-throw (which is 1 without the appropriate ability). You must load the full number of senbon this technique will use into it ahead of time; if it runs out of needles early, it stops.\n\nFor example, if the umbrella was firing 5 needles per 'shower', at 4 targets, you'd need a total of 5*4*6 = 120 needles loaded in the umbrella to make the full 6 attacks (one inititally, then 5 over the next 50 IC).\n\nTargets may defend against these attacks as if they're Speed 12. For the purpose of damage calculations, however, they multiply your damage bonus by (the Speed you performed Jouro Senbon at)/6, rounded down.\n\nThis selectively targets all your enemies in range. The senbon from this technique do 20% more damage for every previous volley from that umbrella the victim was hit by. Thus, if you hit with the initial rain of needles, then twice more, then missed once, if the volley on IC 40 would deal +60% damage if it hit that same target.\n\n\nThis technique uses your base Accuracy for an C-rank Weapon Taijutsu, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply. It uses your physical damage bonus at the time you initially launched the umbrella. You receive the benefits of your Weapon Focus: Umbrella or Weapon Focus: Senbon, whichever is higher. Because the attacks are made by the umbrella, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP).\n\n\\page\n__________________\n\n### --( Nenshou Hoshi Shuriken - Burning Star Shuriken )--\nTaking a large throw weapon, you slap several explosive tags onto it and huck it at your enemies! Pretty simple, and pretty awesome!\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon +10\n  -  Chakra: 10 * X\n  -  Damage: As Weapon + Tags\n  -  Speed: As Weapon + 4 * X\n  -  Type: Large Thrown Weapon\n\nEffects:  \nYou may attach up to 3 Exploding Tags to the weapon; X is the number of tags you attach. When making the attack, you also declare a Delay for the tags to explode, which can be anywhere between 10 and 10+(Chakra Control skill ranks) IC. This explosion is centered on the location the target was when this attack was made, occurs whether the attack hit or missed, and follows all normal rules (damage, valid defenses, etc.) for the class of explosive tags used.\n\n__________________\n\n### --( Itowotoosu - Thread the Needle )--\nAttaching Ninja Wire to the end of an arrow, the shinobi fires and uses chakra to alter the course of the arrow in mid-flight. This makes the shot extremely hard to avoid, at the cost of living a wire leading back to the point of origin.\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon+8\n  -  Chakra: 18\n  -  Damage: As Weapon \n  -  Range: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: As Weapon +8\n  -  Type: Bow\n\nEffects:\nEvery 10 yards you are from the opponent when firing adds +1 to the Accuracy of this attack. Using this technique expends an amount of ninja wire equal to the distance between you and its target. After this attack is resolved, you are automatically removed from stealth (if you were hidden to begin with).\n\n__________________\n\n\n### --( Chakura Nagashi - Chakra Flow )--\nA technique which increases the potency of a weapon by running currents of chakra through it to enhance its existing properties or adapt it to a situation. The user must remain in physical contact with the weapon to sustain the flow of chakra, making this only effective with melee weapons.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Requires: Chakra Control 15, appropriate Elemental Aptitude\n  -  Type: Melee\n\nEffects:\nWhile you maintain this technique, your weapons gain the properties of your elemental affinity. When used against ninjutsu-based defenses, the weapon is considered to be of the relevant element to determine how effective the defense is against it. Additionally, it gains an additional effect based on the element chosen (listed below). This technique does receive your bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls from the Elemental Affinity ability.\n\nIf you're using Dual Weapons, Chakra Flow applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Chakra Flow at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from your Chakra Flow. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives Chakra Flow's effects as a Speed 0 action.\n\n\nEarth: Your weapon gains Stun 2, or +2 to its existing Stun. Every time somebody already stunned is struck by your weapon, their Stun is increased by 1. Anyone who parries your weapon successfully suffers the Stun 2 (or +1).\n\nFire: You add one third of your ninjutsu damage bonus to your regular damage bonus when using your weapon. To determine damage you multiply your attack's damage by its base speed, rather than modified speed.\n\nLightning: Any weapon that parries yours, or which yours parries, has a cumulative 10% chance of breaking and becoming unusable each time. Any damage reduction an opponent has is halved, and you ignore the effects of any armor they're wearing.\n\nWater: Your chakra can momentary liquify your weapon's physical structure, allowing it to pass straight through anything in its way; it can't be parried by other weapons. Additionally, water's inherent fluidity and adaptability give you +2 Accuracy, and an additional +2 when parrying.\n\nWind: The efficacy of blocking is reduced by 25%, and your damage is considered 15% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds upon your enemies. If you're successfully parried by another weapon, your attack still does 50% damage; this does not trigger any secondary effects of your attack (like status effects, such as Bleed).\n\n\nThis is complicated slightly when two weapons augmented by Chakra Flow interact, one parrying or being parried by the other. In these cases, if one of the elements is strong against the other, the weaker element's Chakra Flow effects are ignored for the purpose of that parry.\nAs a reminder: Fire beats Wind; Wind beats Lightning; Lightning beats Earth; Earth beats Water; and Water beats Fire.\nThis doesn't apply if the parry fails (if your Water weapon fails to parry their Fire sword, it still does that extra damage to you), but in the case of Earth vs. Water, does allow an Earth weapon to attempt to parry a Water one.\n\n\nIf you have an advanced elemental chakra nature (such as a Senju's Mokuton), you choose which of the two appropriate effects you're using when you activated Chakra Flow. For example, as a Senju you could receive either Earth's stunning or Water's accuracy and parry effects. You cannot change which you've chosen without ending and then re-activating Chakra Flow.\n\nDespite this, it's still considered to be the advanced element when put up against ninjutsu defenses.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n\n## B-rank\n### --( Hashadan - Blade Breaker )--\nYou deliver an overwhelmingly powerful blow, often an overhead strike, with all the force you can muster behind it; what it gains in force it loses in precision, but its real purpose is to destroy any weapons used by the victim for defense.\n\n  -  Stamina: +10 or +X\n  -  Speed: +0\n  -  Type: Melee, not Small\n\nEffects:\nThis is used alongside any other attack with the weapon, including weapon taijutsu. If the attack is successfully parried or blocked by a weapon, the defender makes a Stamina roll. The normal +5 bonus to Stanina rolls per level of Fatigue is replaced with a -3 penalty (so someone at Fatigue 3 would have a -9 penalty, instead of a +15 bonus).\n\nThe result of their roll becomes the X added to your attack's cost. Thus, if you used Blade Breaker with a Katana (Stamina 12), and your opponent parried your attack and rolled a 14 on their Stamina roll, the total Stamina cost would be (12+14) 26. The weapon used to defend against your attack is destroyed.\n\nIf your attack is not (successfully) blocked or parried, its Stamina cost is increased by 10 instead. If it is, but the enemy's weapon cannot be destroyed for any reason, the Stamina cost is increased only by 5.\n\nThis will destroy weapons created by Water-Cutting Blade and Earth-Smashing Staff, but not Burning Spear. The destruction of the enemy weapon takes place after their defense is resolved (breaking the sword which parried your attack does not prevent your attack from having been parried).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Houfuku - Retaliation )--\nA highly effective maneuver, the user deflects an opponent's weapon with their blade and then follows through with the motion, using their existing momentum to launch a swift slash or jab at their assailant.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10 + (Weapon)\n  -  Damage: (Weapon)\n  -  Speed: (Weapon)/3, rounded down\n  -  Type: Sword\n\nEffects:\nThis is activated after successfully parrying a weapon with your sword. You may immediately make a basic weapon attack against the person whose attack you parried, using your normal Accuracy. This uses a third of your weapon's normal Speed, rounded down; before AP and similar effects, Retaliation's Speed may not go below 4.\n\nDue to their speed, Retaliation attacks cannot benefit from the damage bonus multiplication of holding a weapon two-handed. Attempting to parry an attack made with Retaliation has a -4 penalty. You may not move as part of this attack.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Chakura Nagashi Shuusei - Chakra Flow Modification )--\nConverting one's chakra to an element other than their affinity is difficult; doing so with chakra flow is even more so, as it requires converting your chakra to the desired element, then reabsorbing it in a continuous stream.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Upkeep: 12\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Requires: Chakra Control 25, Chakra Flow\n  -  Type: Melee\n\nEffects:\nAs the C-rank Chakra Flow, but you may use elements other than your affinity. You may only maintain one element of Chakra Flow at a time, even if you're holding two weapons.\n\nYou must be able to use ninjutsu of the appropriate element in order to infuse your weapons with that element of chakra.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Hien - Flying Swallow )--\nThis technique expands upon the concepts developed when learning the Chakra Flow technique. Instead of altering the nature of chakra flowing through their weapon, the shinobi changes the shape. This is used to expand the striking or cutting surfaces of the weapon with an invisible chakra blade, point, or blunt end.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Requires: Chakra Control 20, Chakra Flow\n  -  Type: Melee\n\nEffects:\nThe range at which your melee weapon can be used increases by 1 (in most cases meaning that you can make melee attacks from 1 yard away, instead of 0 yards), and its damage is increased by 2 dice. This does mean that your weapon no longer triggers most on-contact effects.\n\nAdditionally, you gain a +3 Accuracy bonus with the weapon against anyone who is unable to see chakra (which usually means Hyuuga and Uchiha only). Whenever you strike an opponent, make a Chakra Control skill roll against their Espionage. If they match or beat your roll, the Accuracy bonus is reduced to +1 for the remainder of the fight.\n\nIf you're using Dual Weapons, Flying Swallow applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Flying Swallow at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Flying Swallow. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Tsubasa Migaku - Blade Honing )--\nDespite being a fairly simple technique in concept, the precision necessary to perform it effectively, and without damaging one's blade, limits its use to more skilled shinobi. Focusing chakra along the edge of a bladed weapon, the user creates a 'second', sharper blade of chakra that essentially increases the weapon's sharpness, and also protects the blade itself from dulling.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Upkeep: X/2 (round up)\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Type: Slashing\n\nEffects:\nYour weapon deals X extra dice of damage, but its damage is reduced by (X*5)% for the purpose of determining wounds. X has a maximum of (your Chakra Control skill ranks)/3.\n\nIf you're using Dual Weapons, Blade Honing applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Blade Honing at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Blade Honing. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Ryuuketsu Ibara - Bloody Thorns )--\nThis technique coats the tip of a piercing weapon with a thin layer of chakra which reacts to puncturing a victim's flesh. When it does so, the chakra immediately forms a number of small thorns which tear the victim's flesh when the weapon is pulled out. The 'spikes' then return to being nothing but formless chakra, ready for the next attack.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Type: Piercing\n\nEffects:\nYour weapon inflicts Bleed 1 whenever it deals damage. If the victim has an existing Bleed status, it increases that status by 1. This explicitly stacks with the C-rank Thundering Strike (meaning it's Bleed 2, or +2, if paired with Thundering Strike).\n\nIf you're using Dual Weapons, Bloody Thorns applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Bloody Thorns at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Bloody Thorns. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Haruichiban - First Storm of Spring )--\nThe user of this technique throws multiple oversized shuriken in quick succession, pausing just long enough between each throw to correct for their opponent's movements.\n\n  -  Stamina: 14 + X * 8\n  -  Damage: ( (4 + STR/12) * X)d12\n  -  Accuracy: -3\n  -  Range: STR/3\n  -  Speed: 12 + X * 5\n  -  Type: Large Thrown\n\nEffects:\nYou throw X Fuuma Shuriken or Large Star Shuriken, up to a maximum of STR/35 (May never exceed 4); all the weapons you throw must be of the same type. If this hits normally, its damage is increased by 5% per point it hits by (if Fuuma Shuriken were used), or 10% per point it hits by (if Large Star Shuriken were used); this is then reduced by partial defense normally.\n\nIf Haruichiban misses, lower X by 1, its Speed by an additional 4, and raise its Accuracy by 3. Repeat this until Haruichiban hits or X is 0.\n\nThis effect does not alter Haruichiban's Stamina cost, or what its Speed is for determining when your next action comes (in other words: it lowers the number of dice rolled, and the Speed for damage calculations, only).\n\nPartial defense is less effective than normal against Haruichiban; for each point it hits by, it deals 25% of its full damage.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Tentai-ite no Jutsu - Celestial Archer Technique )--\nEvery once in a while a shinobi gets it into their head that it would be a good idea to use a bow as their primary method of fighting. This rarely ends well, but the shinobi flair for the dramatic is often powerful enough to override both their good judgement, and any good advice they may receive. This technique was developed by those sorts of shinobi, in an attempt to make their weapon of choice less painfully impractical.\n\nThe user concentrates chakra in their arms, speeding up their draw speed and allowing them to subconsciously correct their aim in an instant. The downside is that they sacrifice a great deal of power when doing this--but, as many users of it will assert, the technique is &quot;way too awesome&quot; for that to be a serious concern.\n\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 2 + X/3\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Requires: 2 ranks in Weapon Focus: Bow\n  -  Type: Bow\n\nEffects:\nWhile you maintain this technique's Upkeep, your bow's Accuracy penalty is reduced by X. If X is set higher than the value of your bow's Accuracy penalty (for example, you set X = 10 and are using a Yumi), consider X to be just enough to eliminate the penalty for this technique's other effects.\n\nThe base Speed of your bow is reduced by X/2, and the number of dice of damage it rolls is reduced by X. Your damage bonus when using your bow, after being multiplied as appropriate for the weapon you're using, is also reduced by X. Your damage bonus or number of dice cannot be reduced to 0 or lower; if they would, you are incapable of maintaining Celestial Archer at that level.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Gen'ei Tousekiki - Phantom Ballista )--\nA distant derivative of the ubiquitous chakra flow technique, this concentrates chakra around the user's wrists and forearms. When an arrow is drawn back in a bow that chakra extends to wrap around it, and lingers long enough after being fired to strengthen the impact. More ambitious users can even form arrows out of pure chakra, though doing so rapidly puts a strain on their reserves.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Upkeep: 8 or 12\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Requires: Chakra Control 20, Chakra Flow\n  -  Type: Bow\n\nEffects:\nWhile this technique is maintained, your arrows deal an extra (CHA/12) dice of damage. For the purposes of ninjutsu-based defenses they are treated as being a ninjutsu attack of your elemental affinity (Upkeep 8) or any element you have the ability to use (Upkeep 12), declared when you activate this technique. If you use your elemental affinity, the Chakra roll does receive the appropriate bonus.\n\nAdditionally, you may create arrows out of pure chakra. Attacking with these arrows replaces your bow's normal Stamina cost with an equivalent Chakra cost +5 (a Daikyu, Stamina 20, would become Chakra 25). These deal (CHA/8) dice of damage, and use (ninjutsu damage bonus + physical damage bonus)/2 in place of your normal physical damage bonus. These arrows use d12 for their damage if used with a Daikyu, or d6 with a Yumi.\n\nThese arrows have a faint glow about them until they hit, a result of the chakra enhancing them. This tends to draw attention. When attacking from Stealth with Phantom Ballista (either a normal arrow, or one created from chakra) your Stealth TN is reduced by 7 (rather than 5).</text>\n\n## A-rank\n### --( Mikazuki no Mai - Crescent Moon Dance )--\nOriginally developed in Konoha, the technique has since been imitated and reconstructed in other villages. The user attacks at high speed, using a pair of clones to attack the target's blind spots; this actually consists of several strikes in quick succession, the user changing location after each and losing themselves among their clones. Understandably, this makes an effective defense against the technique difficult to come up with.\n\nIdeally, this technique is performed using Shadow Clones; other varieties of clones work, though are less effective, and in a pinch a ninja can briefly create the necessary clones as part of the technique, though doing so is draining on their chakra, and the clones disappear immediately afterwards.\n\n  -  Stamina: 30 + (Weapon)\n  -  Damage: Four times the normal amount of dice rolled by your weapon.\n  -  Chakra: 30 - 15 * X\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Delay: 15 - 5 * X\n  -  Type: Sword\n\nEffects:\nX is the number of Shadow Clones you have armed with weapons which can be used with this technique, up to a maximum of 2. Crescent Moon Dance is always considered a surprise attack, and defending against it must be done as if it was half its actual Speed (if you used 5 AP to reduce it to Speed 15, it would count as Speed 8; this would require a Speed 4 or lower Interrupt to defend against Crescent Moon Dance).\n\nClones used with this technique must have the same weapon you do and be capable of attacking and dealing damage. If you have two or more such clones that aren't shadow clones (such a Rock or Water Clones), X is considered to be 1; X cannot go above without using actual Shadow Clones.\n\nAttempting to parry Crescent Moon Dance requires the defender to roll 2d20.takeLowest(1) in place of 1d20. Ninjutsu-based defenses do not suffer from this limitation. Crescent Moon Dance cannot benefit from Iaijutsu (or, as a result, Flash Blade), and the wounds it deals are reduced by one category.\n\nCrescent Moon Dance may not have its Speed reduced below its Delay.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Ansatsu no Jutsu - Assassination Technique )--\nA simple name for what is, at its heart, a simple technique: the user crosses to their target and strikes a killing blow in less time than it takes for a human to blink. If successful, they'll strike a vital, unprotected location on their foe's body, and in an instant seal that person's fate.\n\n  -  Stamina: 45\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Damage: As weapon.\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Requires: Shunshin no Jutsu\n  -  Type: Small\n\nEffects:\nThis may only be used as a Sneak Attack. Performing Ansatsu no Jutsu includes an activation of Shunshin, which must be used to move you into melee range directly behind your target (normal movement as part of an attack is not permitted).\n\nThis attack bypasses armor and halves damage reduction. Its damage is multiplied by 5 after all reductions are applied, and it inflicts wounds of one category higher than normal. If partial defense does not apply, it instead inflicts wounds of two categories higher than normal.\n\nAnsatsu no Jutsu's Speed may not be reduced, and for the purposes of determining damage it uses the base Speed of the weapon it was performed with (rather than the technique's own Speed). However, for every 2 AP you spend when performing it you may reduce its effective Speed, for the purpose of determining valid defenses, by 1, to a minimum of 4.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Kadou Kikan - Vortex Engine )--\nSpinning their fan like a staff user would, this doesn't create an impenetrable defense, instead the fan is twisted to use all that force to create massive wind gusts. \n\n  -  Stamina: 45\n  -  Upkeep: 12\n  -  Damage: (Weapon's damage) *4\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Range: CHA/6\n  -  Requires: Fan\n\nEffects:\nWhen this technique is activated, everyone in front of you, in a tunnel-shaped space ten yards wide, can choose to either take damage from this technique. or be knocked back CHA/6 yards. This requires no Accuracy; it cannot be dodged, or parried by ninjutsu. Defenses which work without a roll (such as Earth Shore Return) do function against it.\n\nThis effect occurs again every 5 IC so long as you maintain the Upkeep. Each time after the first, the divisor on your CHA for the range (but not the distance knocked back) is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of CHA/1, 25 IC after you begin Vortex Engine), and the Speed is considered 1 higher for the purposes of determining damage.\n\nWhile this technique's Upkeep is maintained you may take no other actions, including Interrupts. The Stamina cost is paid only way in it's initially activated. If you use AP to reduce the Speed of the initial activation, the Speed of the damage dealt every 5 IC afterwards is similarly reduced.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Tenya no Jutsu - Heavenly Arrow Technique )--\nThe natural evolution of Phantom Ballista, this technique wreathes any arrows the user fires in elemental chakra, and leaves streamers of light in their wake for several seconds. To the delight of the more pragmatic ninja out there, the increase in power provided by this technique closely mirrors its improved aesthetics.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30 or +15\n  -  Upkeep: +6\n  -  Speed: 8 or +4\n  -  Requires: Phantom Ballista\n  -  Type: Bow\n\nEffects:\nThis may be used while Phantom Ballista is already active (Chakra 30) or when you use Phantom Ballista (increasing that technique's Chakra cost by 15). It increases Phantom Ballista's Upkeep appropriately. Heavenly Arrow adds a different effect to your bow depending on which element you've chosen to use, as listed below. This applies both to normal arrows enhanced by Phantom Ballista, and chakra arrows created with that technique.\n\nIf used on its own (activated separately from Phantom Ballista), Heavenly Arrow's Chakra roll receives the bonus from your Elemental Affinity ability if you're using the appropriate element.\n\nThis technique does have a noticeable downside: the afterglow of chakra left in your arrow's wake, while quite pretty, gives any enemies a pretty good idea of exactly where you are. If you attack from Stealth while using Heavenly Arrow, your Stealth TN is reduced by 10 (instead of 5). This replaces the similar effect in Phantom Ballista.\n\nEarth: Your arrows inflict a Stun equal to the number of dice added by Phantom Ballista.\n\nFire: Your arrows inflict Burns equal to half the number of dice added by Phantom Ballista, and an Ignite equal to (the number of dice added)/3.\n\nLightning: Your arrows bypass Damage Reduction. If they are faced with a ninjutsu defense which stops damage (such as Earth Shore Return), so long as they break through their damage is not reduced at all (but if they are stopped, they are still stopped fully). Partial defenses from ninjutsu defenses does not apply to your arrows.\n\nWater: If your attack misses you may immediately roll accuracy, with a +4 bonus, replacing your original accuracy with the result.\n\nWind: +2 Accuracy. If the arrow is dodged or parried, or partial defenses applies against either of those defenses, the victim is still wounded as if they'd taken the attack's full damage (a piercing wound if partial defense applied, or slashing if they avoided it entirely) unless they succeeded by 6 points or more.\n\n\nIf you have an advanced elemental chakra nature (such as a Senju's Mokuton), you choose which of the two appropriate effects you're using when you activate Heavenly Arrow. For example, as a Senju you could receive either Earth's stunning or Water's accuracy roll. You cannot change which you've chosen without ending and then re-activating Heavenly Arrow.\n\nDespite this, it's still considered to be the advanced element when put up against ninjutsu defenses.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Sanjuu Hayate - Three-fold Gale )--\nWith this technique, three shots are fired in rapid succession. With each arrow fired, the archer takes note of the effects of drag and wind speed, as well as their opponent's reaction, and compensates before launching the next arrow. In addition to requiring an incredible degree of focus, this technique is quite taxing to perform.\n\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon *3\n  -  Damage: As Weapon \n  -  Speed: As Weapon+15\n  -  Type: Bow\n\nEffects:\nThis attack consists of three separate shots. When you attack make three Accuracy rolls, the first as normal, the second with a +2 bonus, and the third with a +4 bonus. The opponent makes a single defense against this attack, unless they're parrying (not including ninjutsu-based defenses), in which case they must defend against each one with a separate parry roll and action.\n\nEach arrow multiplies your damage bonus by half of Sanjuu Hayate's Speed, but rolls its full amount of dice. The damage of these shots is combined when damage reduction is applied and to determine wounds inflicted.\n\nIf you have aimed your bow ahead of time (taking an Aim action, as described in the bows themselves), that Accuracy bonus applies only to the first of Threefold Gale's rolls.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n# Ninjutsu\n>1. Requirements\n2. Special Rules\n3. Fuuinjutsu\n4. Medical Ninjutsu\n\n====================\n1. Requirements\n------------------------------\n\nLearning ninjutsu is a great deal of work; a ninja has to learn how to mold their chakra, how to convert it to the right elemental nature, then how to properly project it, along with memorizing all the necessary handseals... for each individual jutsu they know.\n\nThere are three ways you can qualify to learn ninjutsu of a given rank.\n\nThe first is Chakra Control skill ranks: With sufficient control over your chakra it becomes easier to mold it efficiently, and mold the vast amounts of chakra used in higher-end techniques with the appropriate precision.\n\nNext is Research skill ranks. You can make up for poor chakra control by knowing how chakra behaves even when you can't control it, and understanding what they technique is trying to accomplish.\n\nFinally, character rank. Once you have enough pull in your village, you can bother the right people to teach you how to use techniques without getting brushed off for wasting their time.\n\nYou need to meet any one of those requirements for a given jutsu rank to learn those jutsu. They are listed... below.\n\n##### Rank:\n###### E: Genin\n###### C: Chuunin, Special Jounin\n###### B: Jounin\n<br>\n##### Chakra Control:\n###### D: 5\n###### C: 15\n###### B: 25\n###### A: 35\n<br>\n##### Research:\n###### D: 5\n###### C: 12\n###### B: 22\n###### A: 32\n\n\n====================\n2. Special Rules\n------------------------------\n\n   ### a.  Earth\nIn the rare situation that there is no earth available (such as on a boat), these jutsu are pretty useless. A few may remain usable (if, for example, they involve you regurgitating huge amounts of mud, instead of manipulating the environment), but most will not.\n\n   ### b.  Fire\nIf you ever find yourself completely submerged in water, Katon jutsu won't work.\n\n   ### c.  Lightning\nNothing out of the ordinary here! This is chakra-based electricity, not real electricity, so it has no special ability to, say, electrocute everyone in contact with water, or anything like that.\n\n   ### d.  Water\nWater is at a disadvantage among elemental jutsu in that it requires raw material to use (earth techniques do as well, but it's rare to find oneself in a situation without ground). Accordingly, most water jutsu require some amount of 'gallons of water' to be performed, listed as a Requirement.\n\nThis water has to come from somewhere. Unless the fight is taking place is near a river (a small stream won't cut it) or a lake, or, say, on a boat, it's not going to be from the environment.\n\nThere are two ways to bring water into a battle where there otherwise is none: the first is to physically carry it, typically in a large gourd (see the Equipment chapter). The other is the C-rank Water Creation Technique.\n\nUsed water is typically scattered across the battlefield, meaning it cannot be used in a technique--it is 'lost'. However, the E-rank Water Gathering Technique allows you to reuse this 'lost' water--if you're going to be using Suiton Ninjutsu, learn it!\n\nYou can't use water someone else is carrying into battle, but water in the environment is fair game.\n\n\n   ### e.  Wind\nBlocking reduces the damage of Wind techniques by only 25%.\n\nA rare form of combat is using a fan to perform fuuton jutsu. It's not without its advantages: using the fan you can rapidly manipulate wind and infuse it with chakra, removing the seal speed from the technique you're using. However, doing this can be tiring, and as such it adds a Stamina roll with a difficulty of 5 + (half the technique's Chakra cost), made at the same time as the normal Chakra roll.\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n3. Fuuinjutsu\n------------------------------\n\nFuuinjutsu, or sealing techniques, are, as the name suggests, techniques which use chakra to form specialized 'seals'.  They're difficult to use, and have limited combat viability.\n\nWhat makes them useful is that these seals are stable. Normally, any sort of chakra-based effect will expire soon after its user stops applying chakra to it, the energy dissipating back into the world. Seals don't, and depending on the individual seal and the skill of the user some can last for decades if left undisturbed.\n\nThe downside is, they're counterintuitive and complicated.\n\nTo learn fuuinjutsu, you have to meet all the requirements listed for a given rank.\n\n######  D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Research\n###### C: 12 Chakra Control, 15 Research, Seal Training (talent)\n###### B: 20 Chakra Control, 25 Research, Seal Training (talent)\n###### A: 30 Chakra Control, 35 Research, Advanced Seal Training (ability)\n\n\n====================\n4. Medical Ninjutsu\n------------------------------\n\nOne of the few good things the development of ways to control chakra has brought to the world is the appropriately named medical ninjutsu. These are techniques which safely transfer chakra to another person, or use it to accelerate the natural healing process, cure maladies, and otherwise ameliorate suffering and avoid unnecessary casualties.\n\nMedical ninjutsu also has a darker side. The pioneers in the field learned the secrets of the human body so that they could help people, but more than a handful of infamous missing ninja of the past have found ways to weaponize it, or worse.\n\nUnless otherwise specified in their descriptions, you may not use any medical jutsu on yourself. For the sake of quick reference, the jutsu a medic may perform on themself are: Vital Repair, Tourniquet Technique, Temporary Suture, and Mystical Palm.\n\nIf any Medical Ninjutsu technique has a listed Upkeep, that Upkeep is paid by the recipient of the technique, rather than the medic; this represents the medic adjusting the flows of that person's chakra to preserve their health. This does mean that those techniques can be voluntarily (or forcibly) ended, though the &quot;Dazed&quot; Wound will specifically not do so.\n\nYou must meet all listed requirements to learn medical ninjutsu of a given rank.\n\n###### D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Medicine, Medical Training (talent)\n###### C: 10 Chakra Control, 15 Medicine, Medical Training (talent)\n###### B: 20 Chakra Control, 25 Medicine, Advanced Medical Training (ability)\n###### A: 30 Chakra Control, 35 Medicine, Advanced Medical Training (ability)</text>\n\\page\n\n# General Ninjutsu\n## E-rank\n### --( Bunshin no Jutsu - Clone Technique )--\nOne of the three basic ninja techniques, this creates one or more intangible copies of the user. These are nothing but weak constructs of chakra, and cannot interact with the world around them--though they can speak.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + 3 per clone\n  -  Speed: 6 + 1 per clone\n  -  Seal Speed: 4 + 1 per clone\n\nEffects:\nYou may create up to 3 clones. During this process you can 'hide' among your clones, making it impossible to tell which one is the fake. Any targeting you must roll 1d(1 + number of clones). On a roll of 1, it targets you; on anything else, it aims at a clone; clones cannot dodge, parry, or use jutsu. A clone that's been hit is destroyed; if you're hit, your clones remain but are mostly useless (as you've been identified by your opponents). If you make new clones (of the same type, or a different variety), all your pre-existing ones are immediately destroyed.\n\nSeveral other actions related to this jutsu are significant.\n\nHide Among Clones (Speed 4, or Speed +6)\nYou pull off a quick shell-game maneuver, confusing your opponents. If they've singled you out from your clones, and you're free to maneuver, you may do this to hide yourself. You roll Stealth against their Awareness skill; success means you've once again concealed yourself. Doing this alone is a Speed 4 action, but it may also be used with another action (such as an attack) by increasing that action's Speed by 6.\n\nObserve (Speed 4)\nAnyone can try to observe you and your clones to try and find a discrepancy, such as the clones not casting shadows or not leaving footprints behind. This allows them to make an Awareness roll against your Chakra Control; if they succeed, they can tell you apart from all your clones, and recognize those clones as such, until you hide among them again.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Henge no Jutsu - Transformation Technique )--\nThis technique is as common as it is basic, yet to the ordinary civilian it's one of the most mysterious and feared capabilities ninja possess: the power to take the shape of another person.\n\nWith this jutsu a ninja can alter their appearance to match that of another person or object. If used to transform into anything but another human, it only lets you take on the thing's shape and basic physical characteristics: turning into a rock wouldn't make you nearly invulnerable, turning into a bird would not let you fly, and while you could transform into a particularly large shuriken your 'edges' would be too dull to cut with--in the last case, however, you would be fairly aerodynamic.\n\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Upkeep: 0\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 4\n\nEffects:\nYou look like another person. At a glance, this is nearly flawless. Of course, the technique has many weaknesses: if you don't know about, say, a birthmark, then your Henge wouldn't reproduce it.\n\nIf someone interacts with you and knows the person you're trying to imitate, they have an opposed Espionage roll (with a +5 bonus; +10 if it's someone they know exceptionally well, such as a sibling or loved one) against yours to see through the Henge.\n\nBeyond just that roll, there are ways a Henge can automatically be seen through--not knowing a password, or saying something the person you're trying to imitate would never say.\n\nOn the other hand, you could just Henge into someone other than yourself.\n\nIf you try to turn into some piece of scenery, any ninja who come within 10 yards of you have a chance to notice the deception; you have an Espionage roll with a +10 bonus against their Awareness to remain concealed.\n\nAny time you take damage, your Henge effect ends immediately; it's just an inherent flaw in the technique.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kawarimi no Jutsu - Substitution Technique )--\nThe final of the three basic ninja techniques--along with Bunshin and Henge--is the substitution technique, allowing a ninja to move so quickly they cannot be seen by the naked eye and replace themselves with a wooden log (don't ask where the wooden logs come from) or other harmless object.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: +4\n  -  Seal Speed: 4\n\nEffects:\nThis technique is activated after you have failed to dodge an attack, but the damage would be reduced by partial defense. In the case of non-damaging techniques, this can be used whenever it hits by 5 points or less. As long as the dodge's new Speed (including the +4 from Substitution, and its Seal Speed) would still be valid for interrupting (you may spend AP to reduce Kawarimi's Speed, as usual, but may not reduce the original dodge's speed at this point), you can pay 5 AP to fully dodge that attack.\n\nEach time you use Kawarimi, its AP cost is increased by 5 for the rest of that battle. The second time you used Kawarimi would cost 10 AP, the third would cost 15 AP, and so forth.\n\\page\n\n\nIf Kawarimi's Seal Speed is reduced to 0, you can perform it without handseals.\n\nAfter successful use of Kawarimi, you may immediately attempt to Hide. Doing so has a cumulative -2 penalty each time after that you use Kawarimi to do this in a single battle. Used this way, your opponent is allowed an immediate Awareness roll against your Stealth TN (though this does not apply to the cumulative bonus they would get for searching for you).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Ninshiki Kaado - Ninja Info Cards )--\nThis jutsu uses specially prepared cards capable of being encoded with chakra. Although the cards appear blank, anyone familiar with this technique will be able to identify them.\n\nThe cards themselves are a trivial purchase (no cost or equipment entry associated with them). When chakra is applied to them (via use of this jutsu) they can be encoded with hidden information. This information can be retrieved the same way, but only by the person who stored the information to begin with.\n\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Seal Speed: 7\n\nEffects:\nPerforming this technique requires a surface to rest the cards on as they are encoded, one at a time, with chakra. Essentially any kind of information (images, graphs, maps, text) can be placed on the cards, though their size is a limiting factor.\n\nSince these can't be used to pass messages, they typically see more mundane uses--like storing one's grocery list.</text>\n\n## D-rank\n### --( Genjutsu Kai - Genjutsu Release )--\nThe most common and perhaps most effective method of combatting genjutsu, if one ends up caught up in one and aware enough to realize it.  Kai involves temporarily stopping the flow of chakra throughout the body, and then sending a burst to the brain in an attempt to force the attacker's chakra from their body.  \n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 5\n\nEffects:\nThis can be done on yourself, or someone else, but you must be able to touch the other person when performing the jutsu.  This allows the person it's used on to make another roll against a Genjutsu affecting them, with a bonus of X. X has a limit of (5+XP/300).\n\nThis may also be done against area-of-effect genjutsu, in which case this technique's user makes a genjutsu roll against the original roll made by whoever put the technique in place. If successful, the technique is dispelled in its entirety.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shunshin no Jutsu - Body Flicker Technique )--\nA high-speed movement technique which allows the user to travel incredibly distances in the blink of eye; used by a sufficiently powerful ninja, this can be mistaken for teleportation by an untrained observer.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Speed: 2\n\nEffects:\nYou move as far as you could in a Speed X move action, where X is how many AP you choose to spend on this technique. There is no limit on how many AP you may spend.\n\nYou may use this in place of normal movement to help dodge an area-of-effect technique. Use your AP spent, rather than the Speed of the attack and your normal movement speed, to determine how close to the edge of the effect you can get. This increases the Speed of your dodge interrupt by 2.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kanashibari no Jutsu - Temporary Paralysis Technique )--\nThis technique temporarily restrains the victim with chakra, as if they were bound by invisible steel chains. Used effectively, it can temporarily debilitate a target for a short period of time.\n\n  -  Chakra: 16\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Special: Stun 5, Paralysis 3\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThis technique's Paralysis ends once its stun has expired. If used on an already-stunned victim, the Paralysis lasts until they recover from that stun.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Utsusemi no Jutsu - Cicada Shell Technique )--\nOne of the oldest, most iconic techniques possessed by ninjas, in the eyes of civilians. It's very useful for the ninja who are concerned with acting &quot;ninja-like&quot;, as it allows a shinobi to project their voice over an area while concealing their presence. This means that a shinobi can talk to someone without giving away their location, and can also be very unnerving.\n\nThis isn't a megaphone, and it doesn't let you broadcast your voice over entire towns. Your voice won't carry any farther than it normally would, but it seems to be coming from all around.\n\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Upkeep: 0\n  -  Speed: 2\n  -  Seal Speed: 4\n\nEffects:\nAs described above, you can speak freely while hidden without giving people any indication of where you might be hiding.\n\nActivating Utsusemi while in hiding does not break stealth (unlike normal ninjutsu).\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Haruka Bakuhatsu no Jutsu - Remote Detonation Technique )--\nExplosives are useful; and, more importantly, who doesn't love explosions? However, needing to be at ground zero of an impending explosion to set tags off is something which many shinobi, understandably, have reservations about, and severely diminishes the potential tactical uses.\n\nHence, this technique! It allows a shinobi to detonate multiple exploding tags from a distance--not as great a distance as most would like, or as many as most shinobi would prefer, but it's better than doing it the old-fashioned way.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X * 3\n  -  Range: CHA/10 yards\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 4 + X * 2\n\nEffects:\nYou detonate up to (Chakra Control skill ranks)/5 exploding tags within this technique's range. This only works on tags which you have primed. X is the number of tags you detonate.\n\nWhen using this technique, you may select a delay between 10 and (10 + Chakra Control skill ranks) IC--after that much time has passed, the tags will explode, damaging anyone within their range as usual.</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### >--( Sanzengarasu no Jutsu - Scattering One Thousand Crows Technique )--\nThis summons a flock of chakra-created and -guided crows which surround and disorient them. The crows continuously multiply and clone themselves, and will soon surround the target entirely.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Range: 40 \n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 13\n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts a -1 visibility penalty which increases every 10 IC until reaching -10; 10 IC after that, it dissipates entirely. It can be dodged.\n\nThe application of an area-of-effect attack will destroy the crows, if it actually hits this technique's victim.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kawara Shuriken - Roof Tile Shuriken )--\nThis technique lifts up nearby roof tiles and launches them at an opponent. The chakra used starts the tiles spinning and allows them to be controlled remotely, in addition to making them far stronger than normal roof tiles would be.\n\n  -  Chakra: Special\n  -  Damage: Special\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Range: CHA/3\n  -  Speed: Special\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nThis requires you to be in a city or other area which has roofs (with tiles).\n\nThis is treated as a multi-throw, with the Chakra cost replacing the Stamina cost. You may 'throw' up to CHA/10 roof tiles, which deal 2d10 damage each. The Speed is the normal Speed of a multi-throw launching that many projectiles.\n\nThis technique inflicts Blunt wounds.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Chakra Strengthening )--\nA fairly simple, yet often impractically demanding technique. The user channels chakra into their limbs, increasing their speed and strength. Despite being very good at what it does, it rapidly takes a toll on one's energy reserves.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15 + 3 * X\n  -  Upkeep: 2 * X\n  -  Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nYou have a +X bonus to you your physical damage bonus and dodge while you maintain Chakra Strengthening. X has a maximum of 5.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Soushuujin - Manipulating Attack Blades )--\nThis technique allows the user to briefly levitate multiple kunai in mid-air using chakra, and then direct them at an opponent, more quickly than if each was being thrown individually.\n\n  -  Chakra: Special\n  -  Damage: Special\n  -  Speed: 4 + Special\n\nEffects:\nThis supplements a multi-throw action. The Chakra cost is equal to the multi-throw's Stamina cost; the Damage is that of the multi-throw, though your ninjutsu, rather than physical, damage bonus is used. You use CHA/10, rather than DEX/10, to determine how many kunai you may throw.\n\nBecause this technique essentially throws the projectiles in a straight line, and lacks something in precision, it cannot be used with shuriken (of any form) or senbon; only kunai.\n\nThe Speed is 4, plus half the Speed of the regular multi-throw action.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose no Jutsu - Summoning Technique )--\nOne of the simplest techniques in the esoteric discipline of space-time ninjutsu, the summoning technique allows a ninja--the summoner--to transport creatures over great distances instantly.\n\nMost of these summons take the form of giant, intelligent animals.\n\n  -  Chakra: Varies\n  -  Speed: Varies\n  -  Seal Speed: Varies\n  -  Requires: Summoning Contract\n\nEffects:\nEven if you know this technique, you may not summon anything until you have a contract with it. These are supernatural contracts with, as mentioned above, supernatural animals.\n\nWhat you can summon, and what it does, depends on the nature of the contract.\n\nThese contracts are often known as &quot;blood contracts&quot;, both because they're signed in blood, and because performing Kuchiyose no Jutsu requires an offering of the user's blood. It's not very much; a few drops will suffice, as long as it's fresh. Some ninja will make a small cut on their arm or palm, though dedicated summoners prefer the rather unsightly expedient of biting themselves, often on the pad or back of their thumb, hard enough to draw blood--summoning-focused shinobi can sometimes be identified by the small, deep scars in those locations.\n\nIf you have a summoning contract (usually obtained from the Summoning Contract talent) you can learn Kuchiyose no Jutsu without meeting the normal requirements to learn C-rank ninjutsu.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kikkake Bakuhatsu no Jutsu - Triggered Detonation Technique )--\nExplosives are, to say the least, useful. Unfortunately, their utility as traps is severely limited by the fact that, normally, someone must be nearby watching over them to have them explode when necessary.\n\nThis technique allows tags to be set to detonate in advance, which both makes them viable as traps and allows the shinobi who placed them to attend to other matters.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15 + 5 * X\n  -  Speed: 20 + X * 10\n\nEffects:\nYou place X tags (up to a maximum of Chakra Control)/5. One or more (up to 'all') of these tags may be designated as 'triggers'. When performing this technique specify a range between 0 and (Chakra Control ranks)/5 yards, and a time between 10 IC and 10 + (Chakra Control ranks) IC.\n\nWhenever someone comes in that many yards of a trigger tag, all the other tags it is linked with (by that usage of Triggered Detonation) will detonate that many IC later.\n\nTags placed with this technique may not be set off via Remote Detonation, nor may they be part of more than one 'set' of Triggered Detonation tags. All tags linked by a single usage of Triggered Detonation must be within (Chakra Control ranks) yards of each other.</text>\n\n## B-rank \n### --( Shoushagan no Jutsu - Vanishing Facial Copy Technique )--\nDeveloped for spying and infiltration, this technique is highly effective, but grisly enough that most shinobi will deign not to even learn how to perform it, regardless of its efficacy.\n\nWith this technique, you steal the face off of a corpse and make it your own.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nYou physically remove the face from a corpse and place it on top of yours. The body in question must be recently deceased (within the past 24 hours) and not grievously mutilated (no Severe or higher Head wounds).\n\nYour voice and skin tone will change to match that of the person whose face you stole, but your height, build, and gender will not. The face merges with your own seamlessly. Unlike henge, use of this technique is completely undetectable by doujutsu and similar chakra-viewing effects.\n\nThis can be maintained indefinitely, but a Major or worse Head wound of any sort will cause the stolen face to tear, revealing (part of) your own beneath it. Aside from being a fairly disturbing sight, this sort of ruins the subterfuge aspects of the technique. At that point, your face and skin tone return to normal.\n\nYou may peel off and discard the face at will, ending this jutsu whenever you please. A discarded face cannot be reused.\n\nLearning this techniques causes you to have a one-time increase of +10 Infamy.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Senri Bakuhatsu no Jutsu - Long-Range Detonation Technique )--\nAn improvement to the more basic remote detonation technique. As ninja become more powerful, they inevitably find themselves needing bigger explosions, and by extension, the ability to not get caught in their own explosions.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15 + X * 4\n  -  Range: CHA/5 yards\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 6 + X * 3\n  -  Requires: Remote Detonation Technique\n\nEffects:\nYou detonate up to (Chakra Control skill rank)/5 exploding tags within this technique's range, with X being the number of tags you detonate. In all other regards, it functions identically to the D-rank Remote Detonation Technique.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kekkai Houjin - Barrier Encampment Method )--\nOne of the most tried-and-true methods of setting traps using explosives, this puts an array of four explosive tags around the boundary of an area. If anyone tries to pass through the area the tags will detonate, spelling misfortune for the target.\n\nRumors of this technique &quot;misfiring&quot; and eradicating deer and bears are largely fabricated. Humans and summon animals will trigger it, but not ordinary fauna.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Range: Special\n  -  Requires: Triggered Detonation\n\nEffects:\nThis technique cannot be used in combat, as it takes a few minutes to set up appropriately. You place four exploding tags at the corner of a square or rectangle, facing inwards; they can be hidden if you have the Tag Concealment ability.\n\nEach side of the square they form can be up to double the Area of the tags you're using in length. When someone moves to leave the area (meaning if they travel in any direction from the center, or get part way in and then turn around), the tags will detonate 10 IC later. Anyone who hasn't escaped the area (or otherwise defended themselves) by then will take the combined damage of three exploding tags, regardless of their location within the boundary.\n\nNotably, anyone outside the 'barrier' is unharmed; part of this technique is that it directs all the explosive force inwards.\n\nDirectional defenses (such as Earth Shore Return) are insufficient to protect against this, a the explosion originates from multiple directions.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Dokugiri - Poison Mist )--\nOne of the most disproportionately difficult techniques to master, this technique requires its user to have advanced knowledge of chemistry, poisons, and medicine. On top of that, it requires exceedingly precise chakra control.\n\nThe user gathers chakra in their lungs and molds it into a highly toxic chemical substance, which they then exhale through their mouth, at which point it forms a large, purplish cloud.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Range: 35\n  -  Area: 30\n  -  Speed: 18\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n  -  Requires: 25 Chakra Control, 25 Medicine, 25 Research, 25 Toxicology\n\nEffects:\nWhen you create the mist, roll the lower of your Chakra Control, Medicine, Research, or Toxicology skill rolls (all of those factor into creating the poison properly, and a deficiency in any of them will weaken it). This is the TN to avoid being poisoned while in the cloud.\n\nAnyone inside the mist when it's created, or who passes through it, must make a Resistance roll against that number, and another one every 10 IC that they spend inside the cloud, as well as one any time they make a Stamina roll inside it.\n\nThe cloud is a poison with the following effects:\nPoison: (Toxicology)/5\nParalysis: (Medicine)/6\nSuffocation: (Research)/10, applied every 10 IC\n\nAdditionally, the cloud itself has a (Chakra Control)/5 visibility penalty throughout its entire area.\n\nThe duration of this poison (how long it will last once somebody's exited the cloud) is the sum of your ranks in all those skills. The cloud itself will last twice that long, after which point it will harmlessly dissipate.\n\nYou are not immune to your own poison mist.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Hari Jizou - Needle Jizo )--\nBy directing chakra into their hair, the shinobi causes it to grow rapidly. This results in their hair not only getting longer, but also growing in volume and hardening into what amounts to a forest of sharp, needle-thin and iron-hard spikes. Even the best-groomed hair becomes wild and spiky under the effects of this technique! This can be used for a number of derivative techniques, and on its own provides a surprisingly strong defense, as the hair will wrap around its owner to protect them from attacks.\n\nWhen this technique ends, the user's hair returns to its normal length.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20+3*X\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n  -  Upkeep: X\n\nEffects:\nX has a maximum of 10. Your hair's length increases by X feet! However, now you have a lot of bulky, chakra-strengthened hair, that gets in the way when you're trying to do super-fast ninja battles. When dodging, or moving as part of an attack, you suffer an X/2 immobilization penalty (rounded up); in the case of moving while attacking, this applies to the distance you can move, the Accuracy of the attack itself, and anything else you may need to do until the next IC.\n\nYou gain a Damage Reduction of (Ninjutsu damage bonus)*(X)/2, which is doubled while blocking. Additionally, the damage you take is considered (2.5)*(X)% lower for the purposes of determining wounds. Anyone attacking you from a distance of (X/3) yards or less will take (your ninjutsu damage bonus)*(speed of their attack) damage; this does not apply if X is 2 or lower. So long as X is 3 or higher, this applies to all melee attacks.\n\nAs a Speed 10, Chakra 5+5*Y action, you may increase X's value by Y, up to the maximum of 10.\n\nWhenever you suffer an Ignite effect, X is reduced by half the Ignite's severity; whenever your suffer a Slashing wound, X is reduced by 1 per level of the wound's severity (1 for a Minor, 2 for a Major, and so on).\n\nIf X is reduced to 0, this technique ends.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Hari Jigoku - Needle Hell )--\nWhile Needle Jizo is active, the shinobi focuses more chakra into their hair. There is a telltale bristling and very obvious 'aiming' of their hair, before they fire of hundreds of sharpened hair-needles at nearby enemies. While these are very tiny, there are enough of them, moving fast enough, to pose a credible threat to all but the hardiest of shinobi.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Damage: 10d4*X\n  -  Speed: 15, Delay 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 0\n  -  Area: Line X yards wide, to a range of X*5 yards\n  -  Requires: Needle Jizo active\n\nEffects:\nX is a value up to Needle Jizo's current Upkeep; after using Needle Hell, Needle Jizo's Upkeep (and other, related effects) are reduced by X. When performing Needle Hell, you multiply your ninjutsu damage bonus by the lower of (X*2) or the technique's Speed; thus, if you did not lower its Speed with AP, and set X = 4, you would roll damage as 10d4*4+(ninjutsu damage bonus)*8.\n\nWhen this technique's Delay ends, anyone in the area will be automatically struck by the flying needles; raising ninjutsu-based defenses ahead of time (such as Earth Shore Return or Water Encampment Wall) is explicitly allowed and automatically successful, but no defensive interrupts (such as dodging) function against this technique. In addition, any Damage Reduction a victim has is doubled against Needle Hell's damage.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Ranjishigami no Jutsu - Art of the Raging Lion's Mane )--\nUsing their empowered hair, the Shinobi extends and manipulates it to grapple with and usually heavily damage their target. \n\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n  -  Range: X*10 yards\n  -  Requires: Needle Jizo active\n\nEffects:\nThis technique uses the current upkeep of Needle Jizo as X. \n\nWhen using this technique, make an Accuracy roll which ignores immobilization penalties. If it hits, your hair grapples the target; you may then immediately use an Grapple technique of B-rank or lower that you know, with no Stamina or Chakra cost, at only half its normal Speed. So long as your hair maintains this grapple, you may continue to use it to perform grapple techniques; your hair has up to X 'limbs', for the purposes of determining which locks and holds you can maintain. All Grapple techniques after the first use their normal Speed, and have a Chakra cost equal to (and replacing) their normal Stamina cost.\n\nTechniques performed this way use (ninjutsu damage bonus + X) rather than your physical bonus. You use CHA in place of STR for your damage dice and grapple checks, and have a +X bonus to your grapple checks with Art of the Raging Lion's Mane. If an opponent fails an Escape Grapple attempt by 20 or more, they are unable to break free; Escape Grapple simply fails, with a Speed of 4 and a Stamina cost of (4 + the amount they fail by, as normal).\n\nYou do not suffer any of the normal downsides from being involved in a grapple, and your opponent cannot perform grapple techniques against you. They may not shift the grapple, only break free. If you and your victim move more than this technique's range from one another, they break free automatically. Once they do break free, your Needle Jizo ends (its X being set to 0). If you end Art of the Raging Lion's Mane yourself, however, Needle Jizo is not ended prematurely.\n\nWhile using Art of the Raging Lion's Mane you do not receive any of Needle Jizo's normal benefits, but do suffer its normal penalties.\n\n______________________</text>\n\n## A-rank\n### --( Toumegane no Jutsu - Telescope Technique )-- \nA very advanced, and in the right hands powerful, technique this jutsu can only be performed by the most skilled of Shinobi. Utilizing an expensive crystal ball and intense concentration, the user can view locations from extremely long distances. \n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 500 \n  -  Upkeep: 30\n  -  Range: (Chakra Control / 10) Miles\n  -  Requires: Chakra Control 50, Crystal Ball (see below)\n\nEffects: \nAs a Speed 10 action you may focus the Crystal Ball's view to any location within range and view the area through the ball. This cannot penetrate chakra shields, nor can it move its view around quickly. A speed 10 action is required to change the crystal's viewpoint even slightly.\n\nThere is another feature, which requires the user to know a person's chakra signature intimately. This means spending time studying them while training with ninjutsu in a calm setting for at least 5 minutes. Once a person's chakra signature is known, this technique can be performed to focus in upon that person, following them around near flawlessly at up to double the normal range. Note, this still cannot be used to locate someone hidden behind a chakra barrier of any sort. \n\nThe crystal balls used in this technique are expensive, costing 2000 Ryo. They're also rare and typically need to be custom made; they can only be purchased with Savings, not Requisition.\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Meisaigakure no Jutsu - Hiding With Camouflage Technique )--\nAn advanced technique where a ninja distorts how light is reflected around their body with chakra inflections, which makes them almost invisible to most normal senses.\n\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nThis technique may be used when already in Stealth; it raises you to level 3 Stealth. If you end this technique's Upkeep, you are lowered to level 2 Stealth. If you break your Stealth for some other reason (such as moving, or attacking), then Meisaigakure also ends.\n\nOnce hidden by Meisaigakure, you are effectively invisible so long as you maintain its Upkeep. You could use this in the middle of a room and then go unnoticed when a group of people entered and had a conversation--though it does not make you intangible.\n\nIf an enemy has a heightened sense of smell (such as an Inuzuka's ninken) or a doujutsu capable of viewing chakra, then your Stealth TN is considered 10 points lower (as if you were only in level 2 Stealth) for the purposes of hiding from them.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Bunshin Daibakuha - Clone Great Explosion )--\nFundamentally, most clones are little more than dense, mobile bundles of chakra. This technique takes advantage of that by essentially converting them into bombs, overloading them with the user's chakra and sending them to converge on a single point before exploding.\n\n  -  Chakra: Special\n  -  Range: CHA/4\n  -  Area: 25\n  -  Speed: 16, Delay 6 + Special\n  -  Seal Speed: 24\n\nEffects:\nAfter finishing this technique's handseals, some or all (your choice) of your clones will charge towards a specific location before exploding. Clones activated with this technique can no longer take any other actions, but nor can they be destroyed by other means, and they no longer provide the normal benefits of clones (that is, the chance that an opponent will accidentally strike them instead of you). In the case of clones capable of using jutsu, any Upkeeps they're maintaining end immediately.\n\nThe &quot;Special&quot; portion of the Delay is however long it would take the clones to move from your current location to the center of the explosion (the location you target with this technique). They move at full speed, though immobilization penalties (such as from the ground being turned to mud) may still slow them down.\n\nAnyone hit by the explosion is allowed a Resistance roll against your Chakra Control (including you, if you're hit). Those who passes their roll take only half damage, and suffer half the normal status effects (excepting the visibility penalty from water clone explosions, as it is based on the location, rather than who it hits).\n\nLike the explosions from Exploding Tags, it is not possible to dodge the detonation of this technique. Each type of clone is considered to be an elemental ninjutsu of its appropriate element (shadow clones being non-elemental). Mud, Water, and Shadow Clones inflict Blunt wounds. Rock Clones deal Slashing damage, and Lightning Clones cause Energy wounds.\n\nMud Clones\n  Chakra: 10, +10/clone\n  Damage: 20d20*1 per clone\nAnyone hit suffers an Immobilization penalty of 2, +2 per clone. This penalty is halved (round down for the new value) every 10 IC. \n\nRock Clones:\n  Chakra: 15/clone\n  Damage: 25d20*1 per clone\nAnyone hit suffers a Bleed status of 5/clone, and a Stun of 3/clone.\n\nLightning Clones:\n  Chakra: 10, +20/clone\n  Damage: 3d100.open(60) per clone\nAnyone hit suffers a Paralyze 4 if one clone was used, or 8 for two clones. This penalty is halved (round down for the new value) every 20 IC.\n\nWater:\n  Chakra: 12/clone\n  Damage: 8d20+100, per clone\nWhen the clones explode, they do so with enough concussive force to daze anyway hit. They inflict a visibility penalty of -4/clone, which cannot be mitigated by the Blind Fighting ability. The penalty is halved (round down) every 10 IC. After the clones explode, the water used to create them (4 gallons per clone) is returned to the battlefield.\n\nShadow:\n  Damage: 15d20.open(11) per clone\n  Stun: 15+5/clone\nPerforming Clone Explosion with Shadow Clones has no Chakra cost.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu - Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique )--\nBased on the same principle as the much-more-advanced Shadow Clone technique, this creates copies of an object rather than a shinobi: specifically, as the name suggests, ordinary shuriken.\n\nWhat makes this actually useful is the sheer number of shuriken that can be replicated with minimal exertion from the shinobi using it; for truly skilled ninja, it can easily reach into the hundreds.\n\n  -  Chakra: (Special) + X/10\n  -  Damage: (Special)\n  -  Range: 5 + STR/4\n  -  Area: X\n  -  Speed: (Special)\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n\nEffects:\nOne shuriken must be thrown each time this jutsu is used. X additional shuriken are created in mid-flight, and vanish after this technique is resolved. X has a maximum value of your CHA.\n\nTwo things must be determined: the attack's strength, and its number of targets.\n\nYou may direct up to (DEX+CHA)/12 shuriken at any single target. Its Speed and Damage are determined following the normal rules for multi-throws. Determine what a normal Stamina cost would be for a multi-throw using that many shuriken; that becomes the &quot;Special&quot; portion of Shuriken Shadow Clone's Chakra cost.\n\nYou may attack any number of targets that way, using up to a maximum of X+1 shuriken. This is selective, meaning you may choose to hit or ignore people as you wish within the targeted area. Area-of-Effect dodge penalties do apply normally, however.\n\nThis is treated as a ranged taijutsu multi-throw using shuriken, and does receive the normal +2 Accuracy from shuriken. No matter how many people are targeted, this is treated as a single attack, with one Accuracy and one damage roll.\n\nShuriken Shadow Clone Technique cannot be used with poisoned weapons.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Nunoshibari no Jutsu - Cloth Binding Technique )--\nThe shinobi uses a giant roll of cloth to wrap their target and, of course, infuses it with chakra. Not only does this make it significantly stronger (as one would hope, seeing as cloth is not generally known for its ability to restrain superhuman ninjas), but it also lays a foundation upon which various sealing jutsu can be applied, should the shinobi performing this technique, or one of their allies, know any.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Upkeep: 12\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Accuracy: -8\n  -  Speed: 20, Delay 10\n  -  Requires: 50 yards of cloth\n\nEffects:\nUsing this against a target without a -4 or greater Immobilization penalty causes its Accuracy penalty to be doubled (to -16), and explicitly prevents that penalty from being removed (such as by performing this as a Sneak Attack) or reduced. While the cloth is thrown from a distance (and guided by chakra), it's relatively slow-moving and very obvious.\n\nIf this hits, the target is immediately placed at a -10 immobilization penalty, which cannot be reduced or negated without breaking free of this technique. The person trapped inside is unable to take any non-Interrupt action other than struggling to escape. Additionally, they cannot use equipment or perform any task which would require the use of their hands or arms. This is a Speed 0 action, in which the defender rolls 1d20+STR/10 against 1d20+CHA/10 from the shinobi who used this technique. If it fails, it applies a Stun 10.\n\n\nOnce someone is trapped, seals can be applied to the Cloth Bind, with varying effects. Any Accuracy penalties normally associated with these techniques do not apply; instead, they receive a +6 Accuracy bonus. Note that these seals are applied to the cloth bind itself, not the individual (and as such, escaping would end all the effects)--indeed, it is impossible to apply seals to someone trapped inside Cloth Binding, as the cloth disrupts the delicate chakra frameworks needed.\n\n   Five Elements Seal: The victim cannot spend Chakra in any way, and all Upkeeps they have (including Upkeep 0) end immediately and cannot be reestablished.\n\n   Sacred Silence Seal: The target becomes unable to produce noise; any sounds they would make are muted (even without their mouth being covered). Additionally, their chakra, and that of the cloth bind, cannot be seen or sensed (by doujutsu, chakra sensors, or natural chakra). If they have any of those senses, they are similarly disabled.\n\n   Influence Seal: It is impossible for the victim to perform any sort of taijutsu.\n\n   Evil Sealing Method: If the Upkeep used to pay for the technique is ended, the person who originally paid it has 20 IC to resume the Upkeep (a Speed 10 action) before the Cloth Bind's effects ends; if they do so, the cloth bind remains intact and functioning normally.\n\n\nIf all four of those seals are applied, the cloth bind no longer has an upkeep and becomes effectively permanent. At this point it is also possible for someone who knows Nemurihane (the B-rank Genjutsu) to apply a Rune-Inscribing Technique to the Cloth Bind. This will allow the victim to be placed in, and woken from, a state of suspended animation at will.\n\nA total of 100 or more damage will destroy the cloth bind, freeing the trapped individual; the cloth takes damage from anything targeting them before they do. It is also impossible to target the victim with medical ninjutsu or genjutsu while they are still trapped inside the cloth.\n\nThe victim can be freed by anyone able to remain in melee, as a Speed 20 Delay 20 action. After the cloth bind has been escaped (by any means), all seals on it dissipate and the cloth itself becomes useless, \n\n\\page\n\n# Doton Ninjutsu\n## E-rank\n### --( Ganseki Tsuppari - Rock Thrust )--\nOften stomping beforehand, you then motion forward and either shoot a narrow column or spike at your opponent, or a rock of decent size. Whichever way, this is the weakest of any Doton.\n\n  -  Chakra: 8\n  -  Damage: 4d8\n  -  Range: 6\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Mimizu no Jutsu - Earthworm Technique )--\nSending a tiny rumble through the earth ahead of you, you cause the area around your opponents to explosively sprout spikes from the ground into their ankles and shins! It's rather painful and good for catching a small group of opponents.\n  \n  -  Chakra: 8\n  -  Damage: 4d4\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Radius: 8\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nDodging this technique allows people to avoid its initial damage, but they are still inside the field of rock spikes.\n\nAnyone inside the affected area has their movement speed halved. People crossing the area may choose to move at full speed, but take 1d4+(your ninjutsu damage bonus) every IC spent moving. In the case of using Shunshin in this area, it's treated as a single Speed 2 movement.\n\nThis technique cannot inflict wounds.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Monosugai no Jutsu - Earth Shaping Technique )--\nYou inject your own chakra through your hands into a natural surface to allow it's texture to become more like mud or clay as your fingers sink into it. This can be used to all sorts of ends. Making a statue, digging a hole, climbing a wall, whatever you want! ...As long as it has to do with rocks and stuff.\n  \n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nYou can shape the surface of a rock, or mold it in your hands like clay. If you use this before climbing an earthen surface (be it a cliff face or a castle wall) you gain a +5 bonus to Athletics checks associated with climbing it, by making hand- and footholds (for yourself only). This doesn't work if you're, saying, climbing up the side of a cliff face using a rope. I really shouldn't have needed to say that, but, yanno.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Yurokensei - Tremorsense )--\nOften placing a hand to the ground after the seals to feel the vibrations, this technique helps you find nearby creatures and enemies. Most importantly, enemies! Their steps, no matter how quiet, can be sensed by you from a great distance!\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Range: 10 + Chakra Control skill ranks and bonuses\n  -  Seal Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nYou can perform an Awareness check against anyone touching the ground or any rock surface (include worked stone, such as brick walls), using your Chakra Control skill rank in place of your Awareness skill rank. Anyone not hiding is located automatically; if you find someone you know exactly where they are the moment you use this (if they're close enough to be in battle, this will typically break their stealth), but do not retain 'sight' of them.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doton: Shindou - Earth Release: Tremor )--\nExtra earth-elemental chakra is infused another Doton technique. When the technique hits the ground, or somebody touching the ground, it causes the earth itself to shake violently in that exact spot. The property damage potential's pretty impressive, but nothing compared to serious offensive jutsu.\n\n  -  Chakra: +5, +1 per rank above E\n  -  Speed: +2\n  -  Seal Speed: +3\n\nEffects:\nThis technique is used in combination with a damage-dealing Doton jutsu, increasing its Seal Speed and Chakra cost accordingly. The technique has a radius of 3 yards, +3 yards per rank above E. Notably, anyone who is actually airborne (&quot;jumping as they dodge&quot; doesn't count) is unaffected.\n\nWithin this area, the shaking ground imposes a Stun 3, +1 per rank the jutsu Shindou was used with is above E; if the technique Shindou was used with already inflicts a Stun, that Stun is increased by the jutsu's rank (instead of Shindou's normal effect). Anyone not targeted by the original attack must dodge Shindou, in which case the original technique's Accuracy bonuses or penalties are ignored.\n\nThis can be used on its own as Chakra 8, Speed 6, and Seal Speed 6. In this case it's Radius 10, Stun 5, centered on (but not affecting) yourself. It does also require a strike roll in this case.\n\n______________________</text>\n\n## D-rank\n### --( Doki Kantsuu no Jutsu - Earthen Skewer Technique )--\nRock Thrust, except actually meant to do serious harm to people outside of training matches. You summon a spike of earth actually capable of skewering an enemy! This can also be more of a solid hit, not as pointy, as to whatever degree they want, and can even look like a fist or some similar, stylized attack, but it's still just big rocks coming at you.\n\n  -  Chakra: 16\n  -  Damage: 12d10*1\n  -  Range: 12\n  -  Special: Stun 4\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nEarthen Skewer inflicts Piercing wounds, and has its damage increased by 10% when checking to see if it caused a wound.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Tama no Nendo - Clay Bullet )--\nPushing your chakra into the ground beneath you, you pull up a ball of earth and mud, globby and chakra filled that you then launch or literally throw sometimes at the opponent. Once on them, the mud is held semi-cohesive by the chakra lacing it, which can restrict the victim's movement.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Damage: 5d10\n  -  Range: 6\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nIf the victim fails a status roll, this inflicts a -5 Immobilization penalty that fades by 1 every 10 initiative counts.\n\nSomeone affected by this mud may make a 1d20+STR/5 (theirs) vs. 1d20+CHA/5 (yours) check to break free. This is a Speed 5 action; for every point they succeed by, the penalty is reduced by 1. For every 5 points they succeed by, the action's Speed is reduced by 5 (potentially all the way down to 0).\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Iwa Funsai Buin - Rock-Smashing Staff )--\nYou hold out your hands or similarly grab some nearby rock and create a large, blunt object from it! This is often a hammer or staff, but also could be stylized however you see fit. As we all know, getting hit with rocks hurts, so this is rather painful.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Upkeep: 1\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nYou create a bo staff or naginata out of rocks or dense, chakra-congealed earth. When using it, you add half your ninjutsu damage bonus to your physical damage bonus, and add a Stun 4 (or increase its existing Stun by 3) effect ot it. This weapon persists until you let go of it.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Shinjuu Zanshu no Jutsu - Double Suicide Decapitation Technique )--\nAfter thoroughly concealing yourself, this technique allows you to move through the ground for a short amount of time, long enough though to position yourself under the enemy and pull them down under the ground. \n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Range: 2\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nIf used above ground, this jutsu causes you to submerge beneath the ground and immediately enter Stealth 2, with a +5 bonus. Your awareness of the outside world is limited to knowing whether or not somebody's in range of this technique. Submerging has the listed chakra cost, speed, and seal speed.\n\nYou may burst out and attack someone in range (making this a surprise attack, but not a sneak attack unless you had the full time to prepare with them in range), grabbing them and pulling them underground as you escape. This is Speed 10, with no chakra cost or seal speed. This applies a -8 immobilization penalty, and completely prevents the victim from moving, until they take a Speed 8 action to free themselves.\n\nIt can also be used while underground, in which case the Chakra cost is paid at the time of use, but there is no Seal Speed. In this case, it could be (potentially) used as a sneak attack.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doro Bunshin no Jutsu - Mud Clone Technique )--\nAn advanced variation of Bunshin no Jutsu, this jutsu creates solid clones made from the earth beneath a shinobi's feet, which change their appearance to look like the user. They have many advantages over normal clones, but are significantly more difficult to create.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12, +4 per clone\n  -  Speed: 6, +1 per clone\n  -  Seal Speed: 4, +2 per clone\n  -  Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nThese follow all the rules for regular bunshin, with the following exceptions.\n\nIf someone strikes a mud clone with an unarmed attack, they suffer a -4 immobilization penalty, reduced by 1 every 10 IC. If they attack with a melee weapon, they roll 1d20+STR/10 against your 1d20+CHA/8; if they fail, the weapon is stuck in the clone (which is exposed as a clone), and retrieving it requires a strike roll and another strength check.\n\nAgainst ranged attacks, mud clones can take 50 points of damage before being destroyed (and revealed as clones).\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Jishin Shushou - Earth Shaking Palm )--\nHarnessing a large amount of chakra into the palm of your hand, you then slam it down into the ground in front of you to blast rocks and debris up to distract your opponents, allowing you to quickly escape their field of view or capitalize on the momentary distraction.\n\n  -  Chakra: 13\n  -  Radius: 10\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts a Stun 5 against everyone in the area if they fail to dodge it. You may immediately Hide as part of this technique.\n\n______________________</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### --( Retsudotensho - Split Earth Turn Around Palm )--\nThis technique causes the ground surrounding the enemy to spiral inwards on itself, burying them alive or crushing them. This technique is capable of causing quite a bit of damage to the area. This technique is much more damaging if used in rocky mountainous areas, or inside a cave. \n\n  -  Chakra: 26\n  -  Damage: 28d12*1\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Area: 10\n  -  Special: Stun 6\n  -  Speed: 22\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nIf this hits and does not have its effects reduced by partial defense, it also inflicts a -8 immobilization penalty until the victim leaves the entire affected area, as they fall into the destroyed section of ground. This occurs automatically if it's used underground, such as in a cave.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doryuu Taiga - Earth Flow River )--\nYou cause a long stretch of nearby ground to become mud and slide your opponents down a torrenting river of rocks and dirt, spewing them out at the end. This often leaves people hurt, and disoriented!\n\n  -  Chakra: 16\n  -  Damage: 12d4*1\n  -  Range: 20, 10 Line\n  -  Speed: 18\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nThis moves anyone hit by it CHA/8+5 Yards all in the direction the river 'flows' (chosen by the line). Everyone receives a Stun equal to how far they move -5; the stun is divided by 3 if they block.\n\nIf this is blocked by an effect which halts its progress (such as Earth Shore Return), nobody behind that effect is affected.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doroku Gaeshi - Earth Shore Return )--\nSlamming both hands into the ground, the user can cause a large rectangle wall of earth to pop up in front up them, covering whatever attack someone may be directing at them. \n\n  -  Chakra: 18\n  -  Range: 16\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThis creates a wall 4 yards wide and 3 yards high that takes the hit from an attack. This wall absorbs 200 + 10*(Ninjutsu damage bonus) damage. If destroyed, any remaining damage carries on to you (in which case you cannot defend against it further) or whoever else you used this to protect (in which case, they can).\n\nAs implied up there, this can be used to protect anyone in range. However, Earth Shore Return can't be used against melee attacks, or ranged attacks originating 5 yards or less away from you. After having all its HP depleted, or at the end of the IC it was used on, the wall crumbles into dirt and gravel.\n\nThis wall takes double damage from Raiton, and half damage from Suiton.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Kaigeki Chite - Crushing Earth Hand )--\nYou create a huge hand of rock that you can manipulate and wield, in place of your actual hand. Though you have no physical connection to the large hand, your chakra flowing through it is controlled by an intense focus on your right hand. Or left hand, if that's your main.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Range: 10 +CHA/2\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nYou can use the giant rock hand to use any non-grapple E or D rank Taijutsu technique, or simply a basic attack, as long as the ability is one that would utilize your hands. No kicks or clan jutsu allowed! It may use C rank techniques, but doing so counts as 2 uses. The rock hand is good for only 2 uses, at which point it breaks apart into ordinary rocks unless you pay its Chakra cost again; doing so has no speed or seal speed, but still has its Chakra cost and preserves it for 3 more uses. The hand uses your CHA +50 as its STR, for the purpose of determining its damage bonus.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doro Nami no Jutsu - Mud Wave Technique )--\nYour chakra being applied to your legs, you turn the ground below your feet into mud which you then stand upon, riding the wave at increased speeds as you flow across the battlefield. This is a good mode of transportation, and a good way to enhance an earth attack!\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nYou increase your AGI stat for the purposes of movement by CHA/2. You may choose to end this technique at any time, or as part of another Doton jutsu. If you end it as part of a jutsu, that technique gains a Stun equal to 2+(your ninjutsu damage bonus)/3, or increases its existing Stun by that much, from absorbing the mud used in this technique.\n\nThis is incompatible with effects which increase your normal movement speed--such as the Runner ability, and Racing Thunder Technique. While Mud Wave is active, you do not receive their benefits.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Moguragakure no Jutsu - Hiding Like a Mole Technique )--\nChanneling your chakra into the ground below you, you turn the dirt or earth or rock into fine sand. It effects your entire body so you simply slide down quickly, but only making a tunnel big enough for one person. After digging your way down, you can sense everything going on above still, and can even cover the hole to make it seem like you never even burrowed away.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nYou dive down CHA/10 yards underground and are now Stealth level 2, and are inflicted with Stun 20. If used as an Interrupt, this requires a dodge roll with a +6 bonus; success, even partial, will allow you to trigger the second half of this jutsu.\n\nNext, roll Espionage +5 vs. Awareness. If you are successful, the opponents can't tell how you left, or that there's a hole in the ground. They think you simply vanished, or died (if used as an interrupt against a sufficiently impressive attack). You are hidden at Stealth 2 at this point, but cannot move, aside from resurfacing (a simple, Speed 0 action once you can move again).\n\nThis can only be used when standing on earth or unworked stone. A dirt road would be fine, as would a clay road, but you couldn't use it on a wooden or brick surface.\n\nWhile underground, you have an additional +5 Stealth.\n\n______________________\n\n\\page \n\n### --( Dochuu Eigyo no Jutsu - Moving Underground as if Swimming Technique )--\nThis technique reduces the consistency of earth into less than that of fine sand by channelling chakra into it, allowing the user to dig through it with ease. This affects the entire body, and the earth returns to its normal consistency after they've passed.\n\nIf the user knows Yurokensei they may activate it alongside this jutsu, allowing them to find people on the surface as easily as if they were above ground watching them, but increasing the Upkeep by 5.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nThis may only be used while underground, such as from the effects of Moguragakure no Jutsu, or to burrow through solid rock. It works only on unworked stone (you could burst out from under stone tiles, but not tunnel through a wall).\n\nYou can move underground using CHA/2 in place of AGI for determining your movement speed. In combat, this requires you to stay close enough to the surface (to draw breathable air in) that you can be found, should somebody overcome your hiding. An attack dealing at least 100 damage will break through the surface of the earth above you, ending this jutsu and penalizing any defense you take by 6, but reducing the actual damage dealt to you by half.\n\n______________________</text>\n\n## B-rank\n### --( Doton: Doryou Dango - Earth Release: Earth Mausoleum Dumpling )--\nChannelling chakra into your arms and the ground below you, you place your hands on the earth and lift up an incredibly large (no, really, just look at the Area on this thing!) ball of earth and rock, which is then thrown at your enemies.\n\n  -  Chakra: 44\n  -  Damage: 44d20*1\n  -  Range: 50\n  -  Area: 25\n  -  Special: Stun 12\n  -  Speed: 24, Delay 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doryuukatsu - Earth Flow Divide )--\nFlowing your energy into special underground 'Dragon Veins' (that means chakra leylines, not a literal dragon's body--I'm talking to you, Takuto) you can literally make a tear in the earth, and create a large chasms. This is most often used as a way of breaking through a large wall, destroying an enemy camp or other barricades and such. \n\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Damage: 25d20*1\n  -  Range: Special\n  -  Speed: 24\n  -  Seal Speed: 18\n\nEffects:\nAny damage from this technique is tripled against an inanimate, stationary object. Don't even ask if this tripling can be done against a player or NPC.\n\nThis can selectively target anything on a line with a length of your Chakra Control skill ranks in yards, and a width of 5 yards.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doton: Dorou Domu Kekkai - Earth Release: Earth Prison Dome of Magnificient Nothingness )--\nThis creates a dome chamber around a small group of enemies, which you enlace in your own chakra to make it extra hard to escape.\n\n  -  Chakra: 32\n  -  Area: 20\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nThis creates a dome of earth directly in front of you, with you at the edge of its radius. Anyone who cannot dodge is trapped inside the dome. The dome has 400 + (damage bonus)*10 HP.\n\nEvery 5 IC which pass, the following effects occur:\n* Everyone inside the dome has their Chakra penalty increased by 1.\n* You have your Chakra penalty reduced by 1 per person inside the dome.\n* The dome regains (damage bonus)*5 HP, up to its maximum.\n\nYou must keep one hand on the dome at all times; if you break contact the above effects ends (and cannot be reestablished), but the dome retains any HP it had at that point.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doryuu Jouheki - Earth Flow Rampart )--\nFeeding your chakra into the ground you cause the earth to rise under your feet into a large rampart. The shape of the rampart can be anything from level ground to a steep, needle-like mountain, and it is mostly used for walling something off, slowing down pursuers, or reaching that jar off the top shelf that is always so hard to reach.\n\n  -  Chakra: X\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nCreate what is basically a huge wall! It can be up to the following dimensions: Length = X, Width = X/4, Height = X/2. If you use this and X is 30 or more, the area you are in counts as rocky terrain for the purposes of jutsu requirements.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doton: Iwagakure no Jutsu - Earth Release: Hidden Among Rocks Technique )--\nThis technique allows you to blend into rocks and remain hidden. Even the texture of your body takes on that of the stones, and it's quite possible (indeed, more than a few experienced jounin have embarrassing sories about it) to have an enemy physically sit on you without realizing you're there.\n\n  -  Chakra: 32\n  -  Upkeep: 12\n  -  Speed: 22\n  -  Seal Speed: 28\n\nEffects:\nThis allows you to enter level 3 Stealth, and gives a +10 bonus to your stealth checks while it's maintained. However, it requires rocky terrain (such as the inside of a cave, a mountain path, the debris from a destroyed wall, or a large boulder), and you cannot move more (blinking and breathing are okay) while it's maintained.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doton: Domu - Earth Release: Earth Spear )--\nYou direct chakra to flow through the skin over all portions of your body, increasing your body's defensive power to its utmost limit. This causes your skin to darken in response to the earth-elemented chakra, taking on a dull gray-brown, almost black color. This hardening also empowers your physical attacks, making this a useful, if draining, all-purpose technique.\n\n  -  Chakra: 27\n  -  Upkeep: 10\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 17\n\nEffects:\nYou reduce all damage you take by your CHA, and increase your physical damage bonus by half your ninjutsu damage bonus. The severity of all Wounds you suffer is reduced one category. Raiton bypasses all this technique's effects, and Suiton has its damage lowered by twice as much (a DR of CHA*2, rather than just CHA).\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doryuuheki - Earth Style Wall )--\nThe most powerful direct Doton-based defense, the user either manipulates the surrounding terrain or generates (using chakra!) and spits out an prodigious amount of flowing earth which forms a wall and solidifies. Either way, this creates a barrier coated with chakra that will stop most attacks totally.\n\n  -  Chakra: 34\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 24\n\nEffects:\nYou create a wall of earth that blocks up to (50 + (ninjutsu damage bonus)*2 )*(Speed) damage. It takes 50% extra damage from Raiton, but only half damage from Suiton and Katon.\n\nYou may use Action Points to reduce Doryuuheki's (base) Seal Speed, on a 1:1 basis, to as low as 12. Note that if you are able to use Doryuuheki as an interrupt, you may do so without the need for a roll. Earth Style Wall can only be used against attacks which originated more than 5 yards away from you.\n\nUsed against area-of-effect attacks, this may protect multiple people, as long as they can all be placed behind the same 15 yard long line.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Iwa Bunshin - Rock Clone )--\nYou either gather animate rocks from you, or actually generate them with chakra and regurgitate a stream of stones (somehow, you're protected from a cut esophagus or chipped teeth during this process). Either way, the rocks then take on a human shape and appearance.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10, +6 per clone\n  -  Speed: 10, +2 per clone\n  -  Seal Speed: 10, +3 per clone\n  -  Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nYou may create up to 3 clones that can look like yourself or anyone else present. If they look like someone else, that person may then hide amongst your clones to receive the normal benefits of having clones; these can even be added to their own clones.\n\nRock clones can take 100+(your ninjutsu damage bonus)*5 points of damage before being destroyed, or exposed as clones, and take only half damage from AoE attacks.\n\nRock clones use your attributes, even if they're imitating someone else. They may take the following actions:\n\n[1 AP] Dodge: Usable if the clone needs to defend itself.\n\n[4 AP] Attack: The clone may perform a basic unarmed attack. This does benefit from Power Attack or Unarmed Focus, if you have those abilities, but the cloen does not need to make a Stamina roll.\n\n[X AP] Move: Every 3 Speed of the Move action costs 1 AP.\n\nWhen Rock Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Doryu Ken - Earth Style Fist )--\nBy surrounding your arm or leg in a coat of solidified earth, you can attack an opponent while being protected from direct contact with them.\n\n  -  Chakra: 17\n  -  Upkeep: 3\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nSo long as this technique is maintained, your taijutsu attacks are enhanced. You suffer no 'on-contact' effects (such as damage from punching a foe covered in spikes) from performing unarmed attacks. Additionally, unarmed parries cannot be used against your attacks.\n\n______________________</text>\n\n## A-rank\n### --( Doryuudan - Earth Dragon Blast )--\nA dragon-like head of rock, mud, and dirt rises up from the gound, its maw wide open. From said maw, it launches dozens of high-velocity projectiles of dense, chakra-infused earth! While not as visually impressive as some techniques, Doryuudan is incredibly demanding upon its user--and incredibly devastating to its victims.\n\n  -  Chakra: 60\n  -  Damage: 80d20*1\n  -  Range: 60\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Special: Stun 20\n  -  Speed: 40\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\nEffects:\nBlocking reduces this technique's damage by only 25%.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Iwa Renda no Jutsu - Rock Barrage Technique )--\nAfter performing the necessary seals, the user channels chakra into the rocks and stone around them. Their chakra causes large rocks to shatter into smaller ones, which are then launched as high-velocity projectiles towards potentially dozens of targets.\n\n  -  Chakra: 48\n  -  Damage: 20d20*1\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Range: 7 * (ninjutsu damage bonus)\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 26\n\nEffects:\nThis technique may only be used in rocky terrain. You may hit up to (ninjutsu damage bonus) targets.\n\nYou may target the same person multiple times, up to one quarter of your maximum. Every additional 'target' spent on them gives a +1 bonus to Accuracy (against that target only) and increases the damage by 5d20.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Doton: Yomi Numa - Earth Release: Swamp of the Underworld )--\nThis changes the surface of the ground across a broad area into a viscous, muddy morass. While the amount of chakra required to perform this technique can be prohibitive in most combat situations, this technique, when properly used, can give incredible tactical control over an area.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Range: 150\n  -  Area: 100\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nThe swamp imposes a -12 immobilization penalty on anyone caught in it, which, after all reductions and modifications, may not exceed -9.\n\nYou may adjust the affected area within the limits of this jutsu's dimensions. For example, you could leave an island of normal ground at the center for yourself, or a narrow path for you and your allies to run through, forming a chokepoint. This does allow you to shrink the total affected area, if you wish.\n\nAlternately, you may use form the 'swamp' in the form of a line up to 200 yards long and 100 yards across, oriented in any fashion.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Doton: Sando no Jutsu - Earth Release: Mountain Earth Technique )--\nThe user creates two monolithic walls up from the ground, destroying the environment for several hundred yards in either direction, and sends them at one another.  As they approach each other, their momentum builds, starting off slow and ending with a collision that removes the third dimension from anything unlucky enough to be caught between them.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Damage: 50d20*1\n  -  Accuracy: -10\n  -  Range: 100\n  -  Area: 80\n  -  Speed: 30, Delay 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 26\n\nEffects:\nThis technique's damage is doubled for determining if it inflicts wounds. If it does cause a wound, it also causes two wounds of the next lower severity, three of the severity below that, and so forth.\n\nThus, if it inflicted a Critical Wound, it would also inflict two Severes, three Majors, and four Minors.\n\nYou may reduce Sando's speed below its Delay.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Doton: Chidoukaku - Earth Release: Moving Earth Core )--\nThe user lowers or raises the ground in the surrounding area at high speed, creating giant depressions or spires. Despite how this might seem, it's fairly harmless to the surrounding area. People, plants, and buildings on the affected area will be largely undisturbed. The sides of the hole or spire are quite sturdy, and it's not in danger of collapsing on its own.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30+X\n  -  Special: Interrupt (uh, yeah, good luck with that)\n  -  Speed: 28\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nThis affects everything in a square of up to 50 yards on a side, centered on its user. It moves the ground in that area X*(damage bonus) yards straight up, or straight down.\n\nIf you manage to use this as an interrupt, this will allow you to avoid a technique if you move yourself out of its range.\n\n______________________</text>\n\\page\n\n## Fuuton Ninjutsu\n### E-rank\n### --( Fuusajin no Jutsu - Dust Wind Technique )--\nYou use a burst of wind to blow dust, dirt, or other loose particles up into the air, producing an irritating cloud that briefly obscures the visions of people caught inside of it.\n\n  -  Chakra: 6\n  -  Accuracy: +8\n  -  Area: 4 wide, 10 long, directly in front of you\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nAnyone hit suffers -4 visibility for the next 10 IC.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Soujikaze no Jutsu - Cleansing Wind Technique )--\nThe basic &quot;manipulate the surrounding air to do what you want&quot; technique, leading into many more powerful jutsu  that operate on the same premise. It's still useful, for a sufficiently resourceful ninja.\n\n  -  Chakra: 7\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Radius: 20\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Seal Speed: 7\n\nEffects:\nThis reduces any existing visibility penalties resulting from smoke, mist, clouds of dust, or the like, by 4. Repeated use of this jutsu will reduce them further, potentially eliminating them entirely.</text>\n\n## D-rank\n### --( Fuuton: Kazekiri - Wind Release: Wind Cutter )--\nThe user generates a narrow arc of wind and chakra, which is sent out to cut things like ropes, lines, and people.\n\n  -  Chakra: 11\n  -  Damage: 2d4*5\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nThis technique's damage is considered 50% higher for determining whether or not it inflicts wounds.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Hineri Dangan - Wind Release: Twister Shot )--\nHolding their hand half-grasped, the user blows a constant stream of wind into their hand which begins to spiral around in a ball or small tornado shape. The tornado is then sent out toward the target as the hand is opened. \n\n  -  Chakra: 14\n  -  Damage: 4d4*5\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Speed: 11\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Shikisetsufuu Shou - Wind Release: Four Seasonal Winds Palm )--\nIn a fashion similar to how ninja knead chakra into their palms and feet to stick to walls and ceilings, you gather wind-elemental chakra, but project and hold it just beyond your body to supplement your unarmed strikes.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Special: This technique may not have its seal speed removed with a fan\n  -  Speed: 0\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n  -  Requires: Chakra Control 7\n\nEffects:\nWhile this technique's upkeep is maintained, all your unarmed taijutsu techniques are blocked as if they were fuuton jutsu (meaning, in most cases, that blocking reduces the damage by only 25%, instead of 50%).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Hagitoru Aori no Jutsu - Tearing Gust Technique )--\nGenerally performed with a fan as a matter of practicality, this technique unleashes a burst of wind that will not only deflect projectiles, but also strip them of any chakra they may be infused with.\n\n  -  Chakra: 11\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nThis is usable as an interrupt against any thrown weapon attack. Make an Accuracy roll against your attacker's; success means you deflect their attack harmlessly.\n\nHowever, even if you fail their attack has its damage reduced by 25%, and any ninjutsu effects on it (such as Housenka) are removed.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Rakuyou Buyou - Falling Leaves Dance )--\nUsing the wind, you kick up any light debris in the area (leaves in a forest, sand in a desert, conveniently ubiquitous scraps of paper in a town) to swirl around you just long enough for you to make a sneaky, ninja-fast getaway.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nYou Hide, with a +5 bonus.\n\n\\page\n\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton Nagare - Wind Release Stream )--\nBy blowing air from your mouth, you can change direction in mid-air. This allows you to control where you land when falling (avoiding the sharp rocks when you jump off a waterfall, that kind of thing) and may be useful for avoiding mid-air hazards.\n\n  -  Chakra: 11\n  -  Speed: 2\n  -  Seal Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nAs described, you can control your direction in mid-air. This can also be used when falling from any height, to slow yourself sufficiently to avoid being harmed by the impact from hitting the ground.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Taikyaku Haretsu - Wind Release: Bursting Retreat  )--\nYou take in a deep breath, then exhale a mixture of air and chakra with enough speed and force to augment a backwards leap, allowing you to hastily escape... well, whatever manner of unpleasantness you felt the need to get away from.\n\n  -  Chakra: 8+X\n  -  Speed: +X\n  -  Seal Speed: 4\n\nEffects:\nWhen attempting to dodge an AoE, you normally suffer a penalty to dodge if you are unable to move fast enough. This technique is used alongside a Dodge interrupt (increasing its Speed accordingly), and removes X*2 points of the penalty.</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### --( Kamaitachi no Jutsu - Sickle Wind Technique )--\nThis technique allows you to create and manipulate many small air currents and vacuum pockets in the form of a whirling gale, which is directed at an opponent before it dissipates. This produces injuries that resemble what one would expect to see from dozens of blades.\n\n  -  Chakra: 18\n  -  Damage: 3d8*5\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 18\n\nEffects:\nThis technique's damage is considered 50% higher for the purpose of causing wounds.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Shinkuuha - Wind Release: Vacuum Wave )--\nThe user takes in a deep breath an spins while exhaling, forming several rotating blades of wind that cover a substantial area around them, slicing through multiple foes at once while leaving allies unharmed\n\n  -  Chakra: 21\n  -  Damage: 4d6*5\n  -  Area: 20 yard radius, centered around the user\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nThis technique may differentiate between enemies and allies within its area of effect. It ignores armor, and its damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of causing wounds.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Daitoppa - Wind Release: Great Breakthrough )--\nA relatively simple technique which creates a sudden gust of wind. Its actual force varies wildly based upon the strength of the user. A superior shinobi will produce alarmingly destructive results, while a weaker one would be better off finding other methods to attack.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Damage: 4d4*5\n  -  Range: 15, +(damage bonus)*2\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nThis uses double the user's normal ninjutsu damage bonus, and inflicts Blunt wounds. It also knocks the victim back (user's damage bonus)*3 yards.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Reppuushou - Wind Release: Violent Wind Palm )--\nAfter finishing the seals, the user claps their palms together and compresses the air in front of them, transforming it into a powerful gale with enough force to knock over a human or redirect projectile weapons.\n\n  -  Chakra: 14\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThis can be used as an attack, as an interrupt, or in combination with a multi-throw.\n\nAs an attack, it does 2d6*5 damage and, if it hits, knocks an enemy prone as if they'd been hit by the E-rank Taijutsu Trip, using your Chakra Control +5 in place of your Athletics.\n\nAs an interrupt, it can be used in response to a thrown weapon attack. Make an Accuracy roll against the opponent's Accuracy. If you succeed you redirect their attack at them, using its original accuracy, adding 2d4*5 plus this technique's damage bonus times speed to their attack's normal damage. Wounds inflicted are based on the thrown attack.\n\nIn combination with a multi-throw, this adds its Speed and modified Seal Speed to the total Speed (not factored into damage bonus calculation) of the multi-throw. The attack uses the combined range of the throw and jutsu to determine its maximum range, and adds 2d6*5, plus (this technique's Speed)*(ninjutsu damage bonus), to the multi-throw's damage. Wounds inflicted are based on the thrown attack.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kazekame Kaigara no Jutsu - Wind Turtle's Shell Technique )--\nThe technique creates a rotating dome of wind around the user, chakra-infused air moving quickly enough to blur the image of the person inside, and deflect many incoming attacks. However, the technique is a far cry from being a true absolute defense.\n\n  -  Chakra: 14\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThis may be used against ranged offensive ninjutsu which use projectiles (such as Clay Bullet, but not Earthen Skewer), ranged taijutsu attacks. or area-of-effect ninjutsu. If used against a technique of C-rank or below, its Chakra cost is 14. Each rank above C increases Wind Turtle Shell's Chakra cost by 6.\n\nMake an Accuracy roll against the attack. If you succeed, the attack is avoided as if you parried it. Against Raiton and ranged taijutsu attacks, you receive a bonus to your Accuracy roll equal to your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus. Against non-Katon 'projectile'-based ninjutsu, your bonus is instead +4. For Katon and area-of-effect ninjutsu, you receive no bonus.\n\nThis has improved effectiveness against Raiton and ranged taijutsu: Even if they hit, the effect of partial defense is doubled (the attack deals only 10% damage per point it hits by).\n\nHowever, it's vulnerable to Katon. If a Katon technique bypasses Wind Turtle's Shell you receive no benefit from partial defense, and the technique has its damage (against you) increased by 25%.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Tobu Choyaku no Jutsu - Vaulting Leap Technique )--\nAfter performing the seals for this jutsu you amass chakra in your feet, then expel it to generate a powerful burst of wind while kicking off the ground with a power leap. To the inexperienced, the results look almost like flight.\n\n  -  Stamina: 0 + 10 * Y\n  -  Chakra: 14 + X/2\n  -  Special: A fan may not replace this technique's seal speed.\n  -  Speed: 10 + X * 2, Delay X * 2\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nWhen you activate this technique you can jump (STR /10 - Y * 2)*(ninjutsu damage bonus) yards vertically, or half that distance horizontally.\n\nAlternately, you may choose to 'charge' your jump, gathering enough chakra at your feet to launch yourself a prodigious distance. This changes the distance moved to (X + STR / 10 - Y * 2)*(ninjutsu damage bonus). If X is 5 or greater, the horizontal leap distance is not halved. X has a maximum value of 10.\n\nIf you are suffering from an Immobilization penalty, the distance you're able to travel with Vaulting Leap is reduced by 5% per point of Immobilization.\n\nThis technique's Y value starts at 0. Every time you use Vaulting Leap, it's increased by 1. After you go 50 IC without using Vaulting Leap, it's reset to 0.\n</text>\n\n## B-rank\n### --( Daikamaitachi no Jutsu - Great Sickle Wind Technique )--\nThe user of this technique releases a powerful burst of wind, chakra concentrating the air into several layered air streams. This creates pockets of both vacuums and high-speed air which have enough focused force behind them to cut down trees.\n\n  -  Chakra: 28\n  -  Damage: 4d8*6\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 24\n\nEffects:\nThis can be used as a normal action (as an attack), or an Interrupt (as a defensive against a ranged taijutsu attack). As an Interrupt, make an Accuracy roll against your opponent's Accuracy, adding your ninjutsu damage bonus; if successful, you deflect their projectiles harmlessly.\n\nAs an attack, it knocks its victim back (ninjutsu damage bonus) yards; the distance knocked back is reduced by partial defense.\n\n\\page\n\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shinkuu Enzan - Decapitating Vacuum Disc )--\nAs devastating as it is impractical, this technique earned its name for a reason. After forming the many, many handseals involved, you draw a shuriken (or one of its larger brethren) and use it to center a disc of wind chakra. When you throw the weapon, its rotation is passed onto the chakra, forming a several-foot-wide blade rotating at incredible speed.\n\nGreat for spars and parties!\n\n  -  Chakra: 42\n  -  Damage: Weapon's damage, +(ninjutsu damage bonus) dice\n  -  Range: As thrown weapon, +(ninjutsu damage bonus)*2 yards\n  -  Speed: 16 + (weapon's Speed)\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\nEffects:\nChoose a type of shuriken to use with this technique; you may not multi-throw with Shinkuu Enzan. Add this technique's Speed to the normal Speed of your thrown weapon attack. This is the Speed of Shinkuu Enzan (both to use it, and for damage calculations). Add your physical and ninjutsu damage bonuses together; this is your damage bonus for Shinkuu Enzan. For calculating wounds, consider Shinkuu Enzan's damage to be 100% higher. Shinkuu Enzan always deals slashing wounds.\n\nAlthough this technique uses a thrown weapon as part of it, it is a Fuuton ninjutsu technique, not a thrown weapon technique; Weapon Focus and similar benefits (such as a Fuuma Shuriken's increased damage based on how much it hits by) do not apply to Shinkuu Enzan, nor do defenses specifically targeting thrown weapons.\n\nYou may not use a fan to replace Shinkuu Enzan's Seal Speed.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Shinkuugyoku - Wind Release: Vacuum Sphere )--\nThe user exhales their breath as several small blasts of wind chakra, each not much larger than a marble but traveling at extreme speeds and possessing incredible penetrating power. Their small size can make them difficult to land a strong blow with, which is compensated for by dispersing them over a significant range.\n\n  -  Chakra: 38\n  -  Damage: 6d8*8\n  -  Range: 30\n  -  Area: Special\n  -  Special: A fan may not be used to remove this technique's Seal Speed.\n  -  Speed: 18\n  -  Seal Speed: 18\n\nEffects:\nShinkuugyoku targets everything in a line 10 yards wide, between you and its maximum range. You may divide the width by any whole number between 1 and 5 to multiply the length by half that much. (For example, you could reduce it to 10/5 = 2 yards wide, and increase its range to 30*2.5 = 75). The Improved Area ability provides only half its normal benefit to Shinkuugyoku.\n\nThe effects of partial defense a doubled against this technique: for every point it hits by, it deals only 10% of its full damage. However, to determine wounds inflicted Shinkuugyoku's damage is 100% higher. Shinkuugyoku inflicts Piercing wounds.\n\nIf someone Takes the Hit for Shinkuugyoku, whoever they were defending will still take 75% damage, so long as the defender received a Major or greater wound.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Shinkuu Renpa - Wind Release: Vacuum Serial Waves )--\nThis technique's user takes a deep breath in, and then exhales several blades of high-sped, chakra-infused wind at varying angles. This technique's power can vary greatly depending on the amount of chakra put into the formation of those wind blades, the number created, and how the user chooses to focus them.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20 + 5 * X\n  -  Damage: (X *2)d10*7\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Speed: 22\n  -  Seal Speed: 12 + X * 2\n\nEffects:\nX may not exceed 5.\n\nAgainst ninjutsu-based defenses, Shinkuu Renpa is considered one rank higher, or to deal twice as much damage, as applicable. (For example, a 200 damage Shinkuu Renpa against a 100 damage wall would destroy the wall and still deal 150 damage to whatever was behind it).\n\nYou may target up to X people with Shinkuu Renpa as a single action. While the base damage remains the same no matter how many targets you have, your (ninjutsu damage bonus)*(Shinkuu Renpa's Speed) is divided by the number of targets.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Fuujin Kokyuu - Wind Release: Wind God's Breath )--\nYou unleash a wave of chakra converted into gale-force winds, knocking away everyone and everything around you. So long as the winds remain, approaching you is exceedingly difficult. At the same time, those winds will whip any nearby fires into a raging fury.\n\n  -  Chakra: 32\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Range: Self\n  -  Radius: 50\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nEvery IC, everyone in the technique's radius is pushed 1 yard away from you, towards its edge. All Raiton and ranged taijutsu attacks within this area have their damage reduced by 25%. However, all Fuuton has +3 Accuracy, and all Katon does +15% damage. These effects apply to any jutsu originating inside, passing through or targeting someone within the area.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Ama no Yachimata - Wind Release: Crossroads of Heaven )--\nOne of the more reliable defensive measure Fuuton users are capable of deploying, this creates a sphere of whipping winds around them. Aside from dramatically tossing their hair, causing loose clothes to flap about, and knocking up loose terrain, this makes a sufficiently skilled user virtually impervious to most long-range assaults.\n\n  -  Chakra: 26\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n\nEffects:\nAny ranged taijutsu and Raiton attacks against you with Accuracy less than (your Accuracy +5) are automatically parried, as are any projectile-based ninjutsu techniques with an Accuracy less than (your Accuracy). You may not be grappled while this technique is active.\n\nThis technique uses your base Accuracy for an B-rank Fuuton, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply. Because it is considered to be the technique parrying incoming attacks, and not you, you cannot modify its accuracy further (such as with Willpower or AP).\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Fuuton: Higashikaze no Me - Wind Release: Eye of the East Wind )--\nAn advanced surveillance technique that, ultimately, falls far short of the efficacy its designers had hoped for. Once activated, it allows the users to view air currents, and, for lack of a better term, 'highlights' inconsistent ones--it's something like visual sonar.\n\nThe idea behind the technique was that this would let its user pinpoint enemies by being able to find their breathing. It's not nearly that effective in practice, but does offer some benefits to those willing to adjust to the altered vision it causes.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 22\n\nEffects:\nWhen performing a Search (in Combat -&gt; Stealth) or Observe (Ninjutsu -&gt; Bunshin) action, you may use your Chakra Control skill ranks in place of your Awareness skill ranks, and receive a bonus of (ninjutsu damage bonus)/3 either way.\n\nAdditionally, when targeted by a Surprise or Sneak Attack, you may make an Awareness roll (receiving the benefits of this technique's effects) against a Stealth roll from your opponent; if your result is higher, their attack is not considered a Surprise Attack or Sneak Attack.</text>\n\n## A-rank\n### --( Kaze no Yaiba - Blade of Wind )--\nA rarely-used technique, not because it isn't powerful but because it doesn't appeal to the sorts of shinobi able to learn it. It's a high-powered, taxing, close-ranged wind release technique; most shinobi who prefer close combat will opt for weapons or other elements, and most wind release users prefer to keep their distance. It has seen some limited popular of Sunagakure's ANBU.\n\nThe user emits chakra from their fingertips, forming a virtually invisible &quot;sword&quot; of intense, high-speed winds, which lasts just long enough to make a single attack with. This technique leaves very distinctive wounds, deep slashes with hundreds of miniscule tears at the edges.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30, +20 if it hits\n  -  Upkeep: 0\n  -  Damage: 5d8*10\n  -  Accuracy: +4\n  -  Range: Melee\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 22\n\nEffects:\nThis technique's damage cannot be blocked, and the effectiveness of an opponent's damage reduction (if any) is halved. If this technique hits, it may be used consecutively (no other non-Interrupt actions are taken between uses). If you do so, its Seal Speed is removed, and its Chakra cost is reduced to 30 whether or not it hits. However, each attack (including ones that miss) increases its Upkeep by 3. Once you release this Upkeep, the blade dissipates.\n\nKaze no Yaiba uses only half your actual ninjutsu damage bonus to determine the damage it deals. For determining wounds, its damage is considered 50% higher.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Renkuudan - Compressed Air Blast )--\nA technique originated in Sand, supposedly derived from what was alleged to be a power wielded by a 'monster' that terrorized that country more than a century and a half ago. The user draws in a deep breath and begins pouring chakra into the air in their lungs, thickening it until it reaches an almost-liquid consistency before ejecting it into a high-power blast of air.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40 + X / 5\n  -  Damage: (2 + X / 2)d12*5\n  -  Accuracy: + X / 5\n  -  Range: 30 + X\n  -  Speed: 10 + X, Delay X\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nAfter completing this technique's seals you may use it immediately (as Speed 10, and Delay 0), or begin 'charging' it.\n\nX is the number of IC spent charging Renkuudan. Unlike most variable-speed techniques, you do not need to declare how long you intend to do this. For example, say you finished the handseals on IC 100. You would then be able to declare you were charging Renkuudan, without specifying when you intended to stop. On IC 120, an enemy might begin running towards you; at this point you could stop charging and fire your technique, with X = 20. X can never exceed 50.\n\nRenkuudan inflicts Blunt wounds, and the severity of its wounds are reduced by one category (major to minor, minor to no wound, and so on). Renkuudan uses double your normal ninjutsu damage bonus for determining its damage dealt.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Okamaitachi no Jutsu - Scything Wind Technique )--\nAlmost always used with a fan, this technique creates a vast number of heavy air currents and vacuum pockets, varying greatly in speed, width, and angle, with their integrity maintained by chakra. Where they intersect, the crossing currents tear apart anything unfortunate enough to be in their way.\n\nAs effective as this technique is, slicing and smashing anything short of fortified stonework, it can be somewhat unreliable, as there's an element of chance about just how many different ways a victim will be shredded.\n\n  -  Chakra: 36\n  -  Damage: 4d10*10\n  -  Range: 40\n  -  Speed: 24\n  -  Seal Speed: 42\n\nEffects:\nThis may target any number of people in front of you, so long as they are all within range, and for the purposes of evading is considered to have an Area equal to its Range. Scything Wind's damage is considered 25% higher for the purposes of inflicting wounds.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuton: Shinkuu Taigyoku - Wind Release: Vacuum Great Sphere )--\nIf the Vacuum Sphere technique can be considered a spray of wind-chakra bullets (not that ninja actually know what such things are!), then the Great Vacuum Sphere is a gigantic wind-chakra cannon ball.\n\nIn terms that ninja actually do understand, this creates a large sphere-shaped vacuum, which is then launched forwards. Anyone who comes in contact with the vacuum is sucked inside, and then either slammed against either the first solid object it encounters or just hit by what amounts to a wall of high-velocity air from every direction as the chakra in the technique dissipates and the technique collapses on them.\n\n  -  Chakra: 46\n  -  Damage: 5d6*10\n  -  Accuracy: +3\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Area: 10\n  -  Special: Stun 15\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 28\n\nEffects:\nIn addition to targeting anyone in its area, anyone between the user and its eventual destination is also a target. Shinkuu Taigyoku is unblockable, and enemies do not receive the benefit of partial defense against it. Anyone hit is knocked back to the far end of its range.\n\nShinkuu Taigyoku inflicts Blunt wounds, and the severity of any wounds it inflicts is increased by one category (minor to major, severe to critical, and so forth).\n\n______________________\n\n\\page\n\n### --( Fuuton: Taifuu no Me - Wind Release: Eye of the Storm )--\nA powerful wind technique, this emanates an incredibly powerful wind, starting about a foot away from you and pushing away in all directions. Though not directly harmful itself, it's incredibly difficult to fight through, and will only grow more so as each wind jutsu you perform strengthens the storm.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Upkeep: 6 + (X)/100\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 24\n\nEffects:\nThe tornado provides a Damage Reduction of (your ninjutsu damage bonus)*10. Any time you use a Fuuton jutsu, this DR is increased by (the technique's Speed) * (your damage bonus, -2 for each rank the technique is below A). This DR doesn't apply to Katon, and is considered 50% higher against Raiton. Non-projectile ranged attacks (such as Retsudotensho) only have their damage reduced by half the normal amount.\n\nX is the current amount of DR this technique is granting you--its Upkeep steadily increases as its power does. Its primary downside, however, is the difficulty in dragging a raging tornado along: so long as it's maintained, the user's movement speed is reduced by 10% for every 100 DR, to a minimum of 0%.\n\nile ranged attacks (such as Retsudotensho) only have their damage reduced by half the normal amount.\n\nAdditionally, the surge of wind each time this tornado is empowered pushes enemies (along with anyone and everything else) away from you. Anyone within (your ninjutsu damage bonus) yards is knocked back (1 per rank of the jutsu; 1 for E, 5 for A, etc.) * (your ninjutsu damage bonus)/2 yards.\n\nSo long as this technique's maintained, it's impossible to grapple you You may choose to end it at will, or when making any Fuuton attack (whose Chakra roll will still be penalized by Taifuu no Me's upkeep), adding your total amassed damage reduction to that technique's damage.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Fuuton: Kitakaze - Wind Release: The North Wind )--\nThe north wind wind cleanses the world of its impurities and soothes the raging elements. Once its handseals are completed, a calm but strong wind blows in from the north.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 22\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nAll environmental effects caused by ninjutsu (such as Yomi Numa, or Four Pillar Bind) end immediately, and no such techniques may be activated for double the user's ninjutsu damage bonus worth of IC; however, this cannot end or disperse B- or A-rank Katon techniques. Any Ignite status effects have their severity halved (round down), and any Immobilization with set durations (meaning, ones that fade by a certain amount every so-many IC) are removed, as is any Paralysis that was originally caused by a Raiton technique.\n\nThis technique can only be used outside.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n# Katon Ninjutsu\n## E-rank\n### --( Hinotama no Jutsu - Fireball Technique )--\nThis jutsu is so weak it's considered a training exercise among academy students who're quick to grasp the basics of katon jutsu. After performing the handseals the user focuses chakra in their hand and projects it into a fist-sized ball of fire, which they can then shoot at a target.\n\n  -  Chakra: 6\n  -  Damage: 2d6.extra(4)\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 5\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Asayake no Jutsu - Morning Glow Technique )--\nIn addition to being good practice for chakra control, many fire-using ninja find it useful when left without supplies. It creates a small, warm ball of fire that hovers around its user's palm, over their fingertips, or so forth. This ball is not hot enough to ignite, well, anything, but it's particularly bright for its size.\n\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Upkeep: 2\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThe orb sheds light equivalent to a small oil lamp. This reduces darkness-based visibilty effects by 3.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Enmaku no Jutsu - Smokescreen Technique )--\nA low-level technique which sees some use even by more experienced ninja, in certain situations. It causes a Katon jutsu to release a prodigious amount of smoke before it burns out, reducing visibility over an area.\n\n  -  Chakra: +3, +1 per rank above E\n  -  Seal Speed: +4\n\nEffects:\nThis technique is used in combination with a damage-dealing Katon jutsu, increasing its Seal Speed and Chakra cost accordingly. The technique has a radius of 5 yards, +5 yards per rank above E.\n\nWithin this area, the smoke imposes a -3 visibility penalty, +1 per rank the jutsu Enmaku was used with is above E.\n\nThis technique can also be used on its own, using a person suffering from the Ignite status as its source; in this case it's Chakra 6, Speed 5, and Seal Speed 5. Every 5 points of Ignite is equivalent to one jutsu rank (so &quot;rank D&quot;, meaning -4 visibility, at Ignite 10).\n\n______________________</text>\n\n## D-rank\n### --( Katon: Houenka - Fire Release: Flame Flower )--\nAfter completing the handseals, the user creates three balls of fire-elemented chakra: one in each palm, and one in their mouth, all three of which can be fired separately or focused on a single target.\n\n  -  Chakra: 13\n  -  Damage: 4d6.extra(6), Special\n  -  Range: 15\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 7\n\nEffects:\nThis technique hits up to three separate targets, and has a +2 bonus to accuracy. For each fireball beyond the first directed at the same target, the damage they take is increased by 2d6, and the technique has +1 accuracy.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Katon: Shitai Entou - Fire Release: Flame Tongue )--\nOriginally thought to be a technique that required a prolonged diet of special, possibly chakra-enhanced chemicals, this was later discovered to be actually a fairly simple Katon jutsu. The user breathes out a thick, nearly solid stream of fire from their mouth--typically at another person, whom they would like to injure.\n\n  -  Chakra: 16\n  -  Damage: 10d8.extra(7)\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Special: Burns 3\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Enkounebai no Jutsu - Sticky Fire Technique )--\nYou spit out a mass of chakra-infused saliva; it's clear, odorless, extremely sticky, very flammable, and kind of gross to get hit by.\n\n  -  Chakra: 8\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Speed: 7\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nYour opponent is covered in the flammable saliva. If they are hit by a Katon technique, the saliva ignites, applying an Ignite 5 effect to the unfortunate victim. The severity of this effect is increased by 2 for each rank the jutsu is above E (7 for a D-rank jutsu, 9 for a C-rank, and so forth).\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Nenshou Yari no Jutsu - Burning Spear Technique )--\nThis jutsu creates a polearm out of pure flame, which the user can hold unharmed (and without lighting their clothes on fire). Konoha once tried to have a treaty passed to ban the use of this technique, though nobody else quite understands what all the fuss is about.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Upkeep: 1\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nYou acquire a naginata or yari made out of fire. It uses your ninjutsu rather than physical damage bonus. This weapon persists until you let go of it. Whenever someone is struck by your weapon they must pass a status roll or suffer burns equal to half its number of rolled dice.\n\nYou may form handseals while holding this weapon, as it is intangible.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Katon: Houyoku - Fire Release: Phoenix Wings )--\nThis technique wreathes part of your body--generally a forearm and hand, but it can vary depending on the needs of the technique--with chakra-based flames! It's quite flashy, and could be considered low-grade nintaijutsu, as it then combined those flames with a physical attack of your choice.\n\n  -  Chakra: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 5\n\nEffects:\nAfter completing the seals, you perform any non-grapple unarmed taijutsu attack. The technique uses your ninjutsu, rather than physical damage bonus, though ignores alterations to the damage bonus (such as doubling, halving, or removing it). If the opponent fails a status roll after being hit by this technique, it inflicts Burns 4.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Ryuuseiu no Jutsu - Meteor Shower Technique )--\nThe user gathers intense fire chakra in their palms or fingertips before throwing several weapons which ignite in mid-air. Aside from being painful, being hit by flaming bits of metal carries other risks.\n\n  -  Chakra: 9, +1 per weapon thrown\n  -  Stamina: As multi-throw\n  -  Range: As multi-throw\n  -  Speed: As multi-throw\n  -  Seal Speed: 7\n\nEffects:\nIf the attack hits, make a status roll (Chakra Control vs. the defender's Resistance). If the defender fails, they suffer an Ignite with a severity equal to however many weapons hit.\n\nThe weapons used in this technique are ruined, and cannot be retrieved or reused.\n\n______________________</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### --( Housenka no Jutsu - Phoenix Sage Fire Technique )--\nAfter performing the handseals, the user exhales a cluster of small fireballs, each concealing one or more shuriken.\n\n  -  Chakra: 11, +1 per 2 speed of the multi-throw\n  -  Stamina: As multi-throw\n  -  Damage: +1d6 per weapon thrown\n  -  Range: As multi-throw\n  -  Speed: As multi-throw\n  -  Seal Speed: The speed of the multi-throw.\n\nEffects:\nThis technique benefits from your ninjutsu damage bonus, on top of the normal multi-throw damage bonus. Projectiles used in this technique are rendered unusable afterwards by the intense heat.\n\nThis jutsu adds Burns equal to half the number of weapons thrown.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Goukyaku no Jutsu - Grand Fireball Technique )--\nGenerations ago, this technique was passed down from father to son within the Uchiha clan as an informal, but sometimes very serious, rite of passage. As time passed its use spread first to other Konoha ninja, and then much further.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Damage: 12d12.extra(9)\n  -  Range: 30\n  -  Radius: 10\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nIf the victim fails a status roll this inflicts Burns 6.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Ryuuka no Jutsu - Dragon Fire Technique )--\nThis jutsu is painfully slow and inaccurate, making its usefulness situational at best. Most users of the technique find some way to bind or disable their opponents before trying to attack with it. On the other hand, if it manages to connect it can be astonishing devastating.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Damage: 8d20.extra(11)\n  -  Accuracy: -8\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n  -  Special: Burns 8, Ignite 10\n\nEffects:\nThis technique benefits from double the user's ninjutsu damage bonus. If the opponent fails a status roll, the severity of the Burns and Ignite are both doubled.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kasumi Enbu no Jutsu - Mist Blaze Dance Technique )--\nOnce you perform the handseals, this jutsu allows you to exhale a slightly translucent cloud of potentially flammable gas.  Even so much as a spark will spell trouble for anyone unfortunate enough to be within it. As an added effect, the glass is ever-so-slightly toxic.\n\n  -  Chakra: 14\n  -  Damage: 6d10.open(6)\n  -  Radius: 20\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nThis technique initially does no damage. However, it detonates and does the listed damage, across the listed area, if a Katon jutsu contacts its area, or if a person with an Ignite status of 5 or higher is present. This explosion cannot be dodged (though the effect which triggered it, if an attack, can still be dodged or otherwise defended against normally).\n\nThe gas is also particularly thick, and not particularly breathable. Every 10 IC that someone spends in the cloud adds a Suffocation 1 status to them.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Yoen no Jutsu - Ember-Burning Technique )--\nOne of the few katon jutsu which lacks offensive applications, this technique's rank comes from the precision necessary to perform it without lighting oneself on fire. It literally burns dirt, grime, sweat, and contaminants from the target's clothes and body (without, notably, causing either to go up in flames themselves). It can also be used to sterilize (or, if necessary, cauterize) wounds by tracing them with one's fingertips.\n\n  -  Chakra: 22\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n\nEffects:\nRemoves all foreign particles and bodies (bugs, chemicals) from the user's clothes and body, stops any ongoing bleeding, and evaporates any liquids covering them (exception: this will ignite the D-rank Sticky Fire Technique). It can even remove recently spilled, not-yet-dried liquids (including blood!) from clothing. It will not, however, cure poison.\n\nThis provides a -10 penalty on any attempts to track the user by scent (i.e. Survival rolls), but only a -5 penalty to find them (i.e. Awareness vs. Stealth) via scent because while their own odor is eliminated, this jutsu leaves a faint scent of smoke. In fact, a difficulty 30 Research roll can identify the use of this technique at, say, a crime scene.\n\nIf used to treat an injury (external injuries which have left open wounds only), this accelerates the recipient's healing time by 25%, but does not stack with the reduction from medical treatment (doctors can do much better than this improvised first aid).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Ikari o Moe no Jutsu - Blazing Fury Technique )--\nA very, very popular technique among hand-to-hand combatants, whose opinions of it range from &quot;pretty cool&quot; to &quot;totally awesome&quot;, this wreathes their hands, and sometimes feet, elbow, and knees, in a faint reddish glow of chakra. When they strike, that chakra ignites on impact, resulting in a burst of flame being delivered to their unfortunate foe. It's quite flashy.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nThis technique alters the dice of any unarmed attacks you make, applying to Unarmed taijutsu, Combo taijutsu, and basic unarmed attacks. Its damage dice become .extra(3) for d4s, .extra(5) for d6s, .extra(6) for d8s, .extra(7) for d10s, .extra(9) for d12s, and .extra(15) for d20s. It does not apply to Grapple taijutsu.\n\nFor example, an attack which would normally deal 8d12 damage would be changed to deal 8d12.extra(9) damage under the effects of Blazing Fury.\n\nAdditionally, if an attack augmented by Blazing Fury inflicts wounds of any sort, it also causes an Energy wound of one category lower, to a minimum of minor (a punch that inflicted a Minor Blunt wound would also inflict a Minor Energy wound).</text>\n\n## B-rank\n### --( Katon: Karyuu Endan - Fire Release: Fire Dragon Flame Bullet )--\nThe shinobi gathers chakra in their mouth, before converting it to fire and shooting it out. The flame shoots out in three sections, each one taking on the appearance of a serpentine dragon which explodes on impact with its own target.\n\n  -  Chakra: 36\n  -  Damage: 22d20.extra(11)\n  -  Range: 40\n  -  Special: Ignite 7, Burns 5\n  -  Speed: 22\n  -  Seal Speed: 22\n\nEffects:\nThis technique may target up to three separate people. You may not direct these 'extra' attacks at the same person for added damage.\n\nIf the victim of this technique fails a status roll, the status effects are doubled.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Gouryuuka no Jutsu - Great Dragon Fire Technique )--\nThe user of this technique compresses a large amount of chakra in their body, and exhales it as a single, massive burst of fire in the shape of a dragon's head. Due to this technique's nature, enough of the chakra used in it is retained briefly in the user's body to swiftly prepare a second blast.\n\n  -  Chakra: 32\n  -  Damage: 15d20.extra(11)\n  -  Range: 35\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nIf this was the last jutsu you performed, its Chakra cost is reduced by 4 and its Seal Speed by 2, and it gains +2 Accuracy. These bonuses stack, bringing it as low as Chakra 16 and Seal Speed 10, and giving up to +8 Accuracy.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Katon: Joushou Ootori - Fire Release: Rising Phoenix Blast )--\nThe user gathers chakra around them--the 'rising phoenix' actually refers to the visible heat ripples and wisps of flame rising around the ninja performing it-- and unleashes a stream of dark, searingly hot fire at their opponents. The flames of this technique are hot enough to disintegrate most incoming attacks.\n\n  -  Chakra: 24\n  -  Damage: 10d20.open(16)\n  -  Accuracy: +3\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nWhen used as an Interrupt, Rising Phoenix Blast's damage becomes 10d20.open(11) and it receives double your ninjutsu damage bonus. It functions differently if when used against a melee attack, or ranged ninjutsu attack. It may Interrupt attacks so long as its Speed is equal to or less than theirs (rather than needing to be equal to or less than half the original attack's Speed).\n\nAgainst a melee action: The user may choose to call off their attack, or press on regardless of the danger. If they do not cancel their attack, they take Rising Phoenix Blast's full damage, without any defense. However, you are also hit by their attack automatically, and cannot defend against it.\nIf they choose to defend themselves, their attack is cancelled; they do not pay any Chakra or Stamina costs, and it's considered half its actual speed for determining when their next action comes; any AP or other effects spent on it, however, are not regained. They then defend against Rising Phoenix Blast as a surprise attack, but have a +3 bonus to any d20 rolls made as part of their defense.\n\nAgainst a ranged ninjutsu attack: This can only be used against targeted, damage-dealing ninjutsu aimed at you, or any damage-dealing Fuuton ninjutsu which would hit you. Compare the damage of the two techniques; if the damage of theirs is higher, subtract Rising Phoenix Blast's damage from that technique's damage; that is how much you take. If your technique's damage is higher, it destroys the opponent's technique, protecting you from it, and your enemy must then defend against your Rising Phoenix Blast (which does its full damage normally).\n\nRising Phoenix Blast's damage is raised by 50% if it interrupts (or is interrupted by) a Wind Release technique, and lowered by 50% when interrupting Water Release techniques.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Akuchori Nabe - Devil's Cooking Pot )--\nThis technique is known for two things. The first is the distinctive, raspy sound made when the user exhales the dark gray cloud of smoke produced by this technique, rather like a death rattle. The second is being wantonly destructive. Due to the composition of the cloud's chakra, it ignites at the outside first, and implodes upon itself, creating a pyroclastic pressure-cooker effect.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Area: 30\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 28\n\nEffects:\nAny Katon jutsu of C-rank or higher will be sufficient to ignite the cloud. This increases that technique's damage by 25% and changes it dice from .extra() to .open(), and everyone within the cloud's area must defend against it.\n\nIf the technique also has an area of effect, add half of the lower AoE (Akuchori Nabe's or that of the technique which detonated it) to the full higher one; this is the area for the new, combined technique.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Jikoku Kasou no Jutsu - Instant Cremation Technique )--\nArguably the most stylish jutsu in existence, after performing the requisite handseals the user keeps their hands charged with chakra (though they do not glow, or burn). From that point on, all they have to do is point at a target and focus for a few seconds, and a location will erupt in flames.\n\nWhile this does make it somewhat difficult to evade, there are several telltale signs (aside from the, you know, pointing). The area heats up rapidly, and there's a low, rising hum near the point where the flash of fire is imminent, as the chakra being directed there builds and prepares to ignite.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Damage: 5d20.open(20 - X)\n  -  Accuracy: +4\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Special: Ignite X/2\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n\nEffects:\nAfter using Instant Cremation, you gain a special Upkeep.\n\nSpecial Upkeep: As a normal Upkeep, applies a penalty of its value to all Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls; you may end it as a Speed 0 action, or immediately after using Instant Cremation. However, it does not have a limit on how high it may go, and does not interact with Uniques or Wounds which affect normal Upkeeps.\n\nYour special Upkeep has a value of X. X increases by 2 each time you use Instant Cremation. So long as X is 2 or greater, Instant Cremation's does not require handseals.\n\nThus, if you had used Instant Cremation three times, you would have an Upkeep 6, and your next use of it would deal 4d20.open(12) damage. Regardless of how high X goes, Instant Cremation may not deal more than 4d20.open(4) damage.\n\nIf you end the Upkeep, and then use Instant Cremation again, the Upkeep will begin at 0.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Enjoukon no Jutsu - Blazing Soul Technique )--\nAll ninja learn how to convert their chakra into one of the five basic elemental natures; doing so is how they perform elemental ninjutsu.  This dangerous, advanced technique takes that to its (il)logical conclusion. The user converts a majority of their chakra to fire-elemental.\n\nThis offers the obvious advantage of drastically increasing the efficiency of any jutsu using that chakra--however, doing so is puts a significant strain upon one's chakra circulatory system, impeding its normal functioning.\n\nWhen this technique is maintained, a person's skin is notably hot to the touch.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n  -  Requires: 25 Chakra Control\n\nEffects:\nSo long as Enjoukon is maintained, the Chakra costs of all your Katon jutsu are reduced by 5, and their damage is increased by 15%. When your Chakra Exhaustion penalty increases from using a Katon technique, it increases by 1 point less than normal (to a minimum of 0). However, the chakra costs for all your non-Katon elemental ninjutsu are increased by 5.\n\nEven after this technique ends, its effects persist for the next 20 IC as your chakra gradually returns to normal.</text>\n## A-rank\n### --( Katon: Karyuudan - Fire Release: Fire Dragon Bullet )--\nGenerally considered to be the pinnacle of how destructive a technique can be without rendering it useless in a majority of situations, the user forms a mass of fire in the vague shape of a dragon's head in front of them, and then fires a volley of blazing projectiles at their unfortunate target of choice.\n\n  -  Chakra: 60\n  -  Damage: 60d20.extra(16)\n  -  Accuracy: +3\n  -  Range: 60\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nThis technique inflicts Burns of (damage dealt)/50. You may target up to three people with this technique, using the same Accuracy for each. You can not target the same person repeatedly to enhance the technique's effect.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Insei Reisai no Jutsu - Meteor Carnival Technique )--\nThe go-to jutsu for dispatching swaths of enemies as quickly as possible, for those who are able to perform it and don't mind ruining the scenery. Compared to other wide-area techniques, it has the advantage of, for the most part, being able to avoid hitting one's allies indiscriminately.\n\nThe user launches an incandescent globe of fire into the sky, where it remains stationary and periodically launches smaller, roughly pumpkin-sized exploding fireballs across the battlefield; on impact, they explode!\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Upkeep: 12\n  -  Damage: 24d20.extra(16)\n  -  Range: 150\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 35\n\nEffects:\nA volley of fireballs falls upon the battlefield on the IC in which you use this technique, and every 20 IC afterwards so long as you maintain its Upkeep.\n\nThis technique uses your base Accuracy for an A-rank Katon, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply. The ninjutsu damage bonus is equal to yours at the time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP).\n\nEach volley may target up to (ninjutsu damage bonus) individuals. Each targeted individual has a fireball fall on them, and detonate with an Area of (injutsu damage bonus). Each fireball (including the initial one) is considered a Speed 10 attack, and receives only half your ninjutsu damage bonus.\n\nA single individual may only take damage once per volley; if you targeted four fireballs at each of four people who were standing next to each other, they would only need to make one defense and would, at most, take damage one time.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Katon: Ryuujin Bakuha - Fire Release: Dragon King Blast )--\nThe pinnacle of wide-area indiscriminate destruction. The user exhales a cloud of not-quite-invisible vapor with a metallic taste, which rapidly expands. Once they've finished, they channel just a small bit of chakra into it, turning the gas from inert to violently reactive and engulfing the area in a fireball which has no peer. The user is protected from this explosion; their friends, however, are not.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Damage: 40d20.open(11)\n  -  Effects: Burns 15, Ignite 20, Stun 10\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Area: Radius of (Damage Bonus)*10 yards.\n  -  Speed: 30, Delay 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 22\n\nEffects:\nEvery initiative count in the delay, this technique gains 5% of its damage, radius, and effects. The use of any Katon jutsu of C-rank or above (or the presence of any person suffering from an Ignite status of 10 or greater) in this area will detonate it prematurely.\n\nIf an effect is used which would disperse the gas cloud (such as the A-rank Fuuton: Kitakaze) during the Delay period, its damage, range, and effects all reset to 0%; and can be built back up by continuing it.\n\nYou may choose to detonate this when you finish it (in which case you will probably be in the area of effect; however, you take only half damage from your own Ryuujin Bakuha), or not. If not, it'll remain until detonated by the presence of someone with an Ignite 10, or a Katon jutsu of C-rank or above.\n\nRyuujin Bakuha inflicts an Energy wound, and two Blunt wounds of the same severity. If it's used in a confined space (such as indoors, or in a cave) it does an additional 10d20.open(16) damage, and its effects are raised to Burns 25, Ignite 25, and Stun 20.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Sunde Bakudan - Living Bomb )--\nA technique invented in the middle of the Third Shinobi World War--and, as the horrors from that era go, it's only slightly atrocious.\n\nThe user molds a mass of volatile fire-elemental chakra and, rather than forming it into a jutsu, injects it directly into a foe. The chakra will last a few minutes at most, before surging through their chakra coils violently and turning them into the catalyst for a powerful explosion.\n\nIt saw extensive use for taking out medics who'd rush to the battlefield to retrieve injured comrades, only to be killed or wounded in the ensuing explosion.\n\n  -  Chakra: 35, raised to 50 if it hits\n  -  Damage: 25d20.open(11)\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nWhoever you hit with this technique becomes a living bomb! When you place this technique, you also set a timer, between 1 and (your Chakra Control skill ranks)*5 IC. At that point, they will detonate. The initial attack itself does not deal damage.\n\nYou may also perform a Speed 5, Seal Speed 20 action to detonate someone immediately.\n\nWhen a person is detonated, they make a Chakra 30 roll; whether they pass or fail has no effect on the technique, though as normal they might advance in Fatigue.\n\nThe explosion itself is Area 25. The bomb themselves may not defend against it, though anyone else can. The technique's damage is considered 25% higher for the purposes of wounding the bomb.\n\n\\page\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Maru o Moyashi no Jutsu - Burning Circle Technique )--\nPopular among bounty-hunting ninja, this technique creates a circular wall of flame surrounding an area. While it's by no means impregnable, attempting to charge through a virtually-solid sheet of chakra-fueled fire tends to have the expected result. It's useful both for ensuring an opponent won't run away (or making them pay for trying to do so), and for keeping an adversary isolated from the battle.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Upkeep: 8\n  -  Damage: 40d20.extra(6)\n  -  Range: 40\n  -  Radius: Up to (ninjutsu damage bonus) * 5\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 26\n\nEffects:\nThis creates a circular wall of flame centered on a location within range, with the listed radius. The wall itself is 1 yard thick, and (ninjutsu damage bonus) * 3 yards tall.\n\nAnyone who crosses the wall takes the listed damage, as well as an Ignite equal to the user's ninjutsu damage bonus, and a Burn equal to twice the user's ninjutsu damage bonus. It uses the Speed it was performed at to determine the damage from its user's ninjutsu damage bonus. As it does not constitute an attack at that point, defensive Interrupts can't be used to mitigate it.</text>\n\\page\n\n# Raiton Jutsu\n## E-rank\n### --( Rashinban no Jutsu - Compass Technique )--\nIt's about what it sounds like. The user channels lightning-elemental chakra into a needle, or kunai, or similar-sized and -shaped object, which will then, when laid flat (sometimes requiring a few taps to help it along) point towards magnetic north.\n\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nAllows a single kunai or senbon to be used as a compass for 6 hours or until used in an attack. It's not quite perfect, but it's good enough for most uses.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Shougeki Heki - Shocking Burst )--\nHolding a hand out there is a pulse of electricity. This isn't nearly enough to kill anyone, but it definitely hurts.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Damage: 2d10\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Seal Speed: 6\n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts Paralyze 1 for 20 IC. It can target either a single person, or everyone within the range. If the latter, it does not penalize dodges as a regular area of effect technique would.\n\nShocking Burst's Speed may not be reduced below 4.</text>\n\n## D-rank\n### --( Shuurai - Lightning Strike )--\nYou focus energy to the tips of your fingers on either hand, then point at an opponent, releasing a reasonably sized bolt of electricity. This is nothing like real lightning, but it looks similar!\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Damage: 2d6*3d4\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts Paralysis 1 for 20 IC if its target fails a status roll.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Juude - Electric Charge )--\nRubbing your hands together you create a large electrical charge, which only needs the slightest touch to be delivered, and will temporarily energize the opponent with an amount of lightning-elemented chakra.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Range: Melee\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 6 \n\nEffects:\nThis 'charges' an opponent, and gives the next ranged Raiton technique used against them an Accuracy bonus of +1, plus the severity of any Paralysis they have. Thus, when using Raiton against someone with Juude and Paralysis 3 you'd have a +4 Accuracy bonus.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Jinrai no Jutsu - Thunderclap Technique )--\nThe user puts both hands together, forming a miniature thunder bolt between his hands, splitting the air and forming an extremely loud BANG, which is rather startling when your a few inches from it, and not expecting it. It has the added benefits of temporarily deafening the opponent.\n\n  -  Chakra: 14\n  -  Range: 10 radius around user\n  -  Special: Stun 3\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThe Stun's severity is doubled if its victims fail a status roll.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shinkei Attou no Jutsu - Nerve Overloading Technique )--\nYou send a 'spark' of chakra into an enemy, stimulating any electrical chakra already in their system and sending them into several seconds of agonizing convulsions. \n\n  -  Chakra: 16\n  -  Range: 15\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThis has +3 Accuracy per level of Paralysis on the target. It ends all Raiton-induced Paralysis effects on them, and inflicts them with a Stun equal to 5 per severity of the highest Paralysis removed. Thus, someone suffering from Paralysis 4 would be Stunned for 20 IC.\n\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Kyousou Ikazuchi no Jutsu - Racing Thunder Technique )--\nBy pumping your legs full of lightning chakra, you raise your muscle's response time, and their power as well. Unfortunately, this is all focused in just your legs.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nYour AGI is treated as 25% higher for the purposes of movement.\n\nAdditionally, you may choose to declare a Speed X move action, where X may be up to your bonus to Stamina rolls. Unlike normal movement (which is handled on an IC-by-IC basis), the movement for this action is resolved immediately. However, moving this way has a Stamina cost equal to the number of yards you travel. You may not reduce this action's Speed by spending AP.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kaminari no Yaiba - Lightning Blade )--\nWith a quick burst of lightning natured chakra, you force it through a metallic weapon and into your enemy, usually during some sort of attack. This is a burst of energy, rather than a proper chakra flow technique.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Stamina: As Weapon\n  -  Damage: As Weapon\n  -  Range: As Weapon\n  -  Speed: As Weapon+5\n\nEffects:\nThis ignores half of any opponent's damage reduction (if any). This attack counts as a taijutsu attack with your NDB in place of your PDB, and causes the attack to be treated as a melee-ranged Raiton technique (for determining the efficacy of jutsu-based defenses and the like).\n\nIf this is parried by a metal weapon, or unarmed (if the person has an ability to let them do so), the attack still inflicts 20% damage. If blocked, the blocking has its effect reduced by 10% (from 50% to 40%, and so forth).\n\nTo use this with a ranged weapon, you need 1 yard of ninja wire attached to the weapon (which it can be assumed you did in preparation, or as you perform the technique). For multi-throws, this can rapidly become an awful lot of wire.\n\n______________________</text>\n## C-rank\n### --( Raikyuu - Lightning Ball )--\nCharging up electricity between two weapons, you harness it into a ball and then fire it at your enemies, the ball exploding out once it makes contact with anything.\n\n  -  Chakra: 22\n  -  Damage: 100\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Range: 15\n  -  Speed: 22\n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts Paralysis 2 for 20 IC, and requires you to have a metal weapon in each hand. This also hits anyone within 3 yards of the target.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kanden Satsujin - Electric Murder )--\nYou hold out your palms toward the enemy and discharge huge amounts of lightning chakra, searing the flesh of your enemy.\n\n  -  Chakra: 17\n  -  Damage: 30d2\n  -  Range: 6\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nIf this technique is the last attack you used, and you haven't performed any handseals since the last time you used it, its does not require handseals.\n\nWhen used consecutively, add half the damage of all previous consecutive uses for the purpose of determining wounds. For example, say you dealt 60, then 40, then 50 damage with it. This would deal a total of ( 60 + 50 + 40 ) 150 damage. Each consecutive use also increases its Chakra cost by 1.\n\nFor determining if you wounded your opponent, the first technique would be treated as 60 damage, the second as (40 + 60/2) 70, and the third as (50 + 60/2 + 40/2) 100.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kangekiha - Wave of Inspiration )--\nFocusing a great amount of lightning chakra into their hands, the user then places them on or near something that will conduct the attack into their opponent. Be it something metal, something wet, or whatever, as long as there is a conductive material, there will be a target who is hit!\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Damage: 2d8*5d4\n  -  Accuracy: -8\n  -  Range: 40\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n\nEffects:\nIf this is used on a conductive surface (such as a metal pipe, or the surface of a lake) that your opponent is in contact with, its Accuracy penalty is removed and your damage bonus is doubled.\n\nIf someone was hit by a Suiton ninjutsu in the past 15 IC, this technique's Accuracy penalty is reduced to -2, but your damage bonus is not increased.\n\nFor every point of Paralysis a target is suffering from, the Accuracy penalty is reduced by 2; however, if this hits their Paralysis status is ended.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Taiyouken - Solar Flare )--\nBlinds opponents who don't know to close their eyes. Not affected by doujutsu which bypass visibility penalties, and may in fact temporarily shut them down.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts a -8 visibility penalty on anyone in range. Used as an Interrupt, there is a chance the sudden flash of light will cause an opponent to miss entirely; treat your defense as if you'd rolled a 5 on a dodge attempt, and if this would allow you to dodge with their visibility penalty, then they simply miss.\n\nThis negates the effects of any active doujutsu on its victims until its penalty has faded to -4.\n\nWhen you use this technique, you and anyone in range make an opposed Initiative roll, with the victims getting a +5 bonus for each previous time this technique has been used in that combat. If you beat their roll, they're blinded; if not, they managed to close their eyes in time.\n\nThe penalty fades at the rate of 1 per 5 IC.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Chuubu Gaki no Jutsu - Ghoul Paralysis Technique )--\nAfter making contact with an enemy, you send a powerful pulse of electricity through their body, momentarily overstimulating their nervous system. For several seconds afterwards, the recipient of the shock will find their body sluggish and poorly responsive.\n\nWhile not actual harmful, this is exceptionally painful.\n\n  -  Chakra: 16\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts Paralysis 2 for 20 IC, raised to Paralysis 4 for 40 IC if the victim fails a status roll.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Raiton: Fukushuu Kaminarikami - Lightning Release: Avenging Lightning God )--\nYou divert your chakra to surge across your skin, building up something akin to a strong static charge. Unlike actual static electricity, this is incredibly dangerous.\n\n  -  Chakra: 18 \n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Damage: 4d6*2d4\n  -  Special: This technique receives only half your damage bonus.\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nAny time you are struck by an unarmed melee attack or metallic melee weapon, this technique 'discharges'. Your attack deals its damage as a result of their attack, and you must make its Chakra roll again.\n\nAvenging Lightning God's damage is increased by 10% for every 1 point of Paralyze the attacker is afflicted by. Additionally, anyone damaged by this move is afflicted by a Paralyze 1 status for 40 IC. If they hit you again while still suffering from it, its severity is raised by 1.\n\n______________________</text>\n## B-rank\n### --( Raijuu Hashiri no Jutsu - Lightning Beast Running Technique )--\nCharging both your hands with a powerful electric current, you slam them together and expel a creature made of pure lightning, in whatever form you choose (one of a realistic, quadripedal animal). The beast then runs at your enemy, connected to your hands by a lightning 'leash' that allows you to redirect the attack if an enemy defends against it.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Damage: 4d10*3d4\n  -  Range: 40\n  -  Special: Paralysis 2 for 30 IC\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nAfter seeing the result of your opponent's defense, you may choose to make them reroll it. If you do this, they keep the second result (even if it's better). If you use this option, Raijuu Hashiri's damage is halved for the purpose of determining wounds, and its Paralysis status is removed.\n\nYou may also use the redirect to send the beast after a different target; it still suffers the usual reductions this way.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Raiton Bunshin no Jutsu - Lightning Release Clone Technique )--\nThis technique creates a power, not-quite-fully independent copy of yourself. They're capable of bringing substantial force to bear in combat, but lack enough physical cohesion to survive being hit in combat. Of course, striking a ball of animated lightning tends to be bad for one's health.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15, +5 per clone\n  -  Damage: 100*1d3\n  -  Range: Melee \n  -  Special: Paralysis 4 for 30 IC\n  -  Speed: 8, +4 per clone\n  -  Seal Speed: 12, +4 per clone\n  -  Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nYou can create up to two clones. These function like regular bunshin, but may take the actions listed below. Additionally, anyone who destroys a Lightning Clone with a melee attacks takes this technique's damage automatically. Lightning Clones are all at Fatigue 0; if they ever reach Fatigue 1, they are destroyed.\n\n[X AP] Move: Your clones can move, where X is the Speed of the Move action.\n\n[4 AP] Basic Unarmed: A basic unarmed attack, using your attributes.\n\n[X AP] Basic Weapon: You may transfer any number of weapons to your Raiton Bunshin when you create them. They may attack with those weapons, using your abilities. X is half the Speed of the attack.\n\n[X AP] Multi-Throw: Should be self-explanatory. X is half the Speed of the multi-throw.\n\n[X AP] Raiton Ninjutsu: The clone must first perform the handseals, at the regular speed, costing AP equal to half the technique's modified Seal Speed. It then costs X AP, where X is half the technique's Speed. They cannot, however, use Raiton Bunshin.\n\n\nWhen Lightning Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category.\n\nLightning Clones use your base Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion bonuses, as if they were a Fatigue 0 version of you without any temporary benefits (such as having eaten a Soldier Pill before creating them). If a clone fails a Fatigue roll, it vanishes just as if it had been struck.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Gian - False Darkness )--\nAfter completing the handseals the user forms a large, spear-shaped bolt of lightning which can be directed at distant targets. One of this technique's advantages is its ability to be used in rapid succession, allowing for rapid long-range bombardment.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Damage: 75*1d6\n  -  Range: 60\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 35\n\nEffects:\nOnce the technique's seals have been completed, you may repeatedly use Gian at Seal Speed 0 as long as you take no other ninjutsu or non-Interrupt actions. Thus, you could dodge, but not punch, and not used a ninjutsu-based defense.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Raiton: Shichuu Shibari - Lightning Release: Four Pillar Bind )--\nFour pillars of rock, each about twenty feet tall, are summoned around an enemy (don't ask how that works for a lightning jutsu). Lightning arcs between the pillars, flooding the area with electricity. While the damage done by this technique is fairly mild, it can easily immobilize someone within the area.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Damage: 2d8*3d4\n  -  Range: CHA /2\n  -  Area: 25 x 25 square\n  -  Special: Paraylsis 5, Immobilize 8\n  -  Speed: 25 \n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nThis technique inflicts its statuses on anyone other than the user who is within its area. They do not end until the victim has managed to leave. This technique lasts for 60 IC, or until you end the Upkeep, whichever comes sooner.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Tesura Karui - Tesla Minor )--\nThis generates a semi-stable mass of lightning chakra which you can physically throw. It'll 'stick' to the first surface it comes into contact with (people are not surfaces). Once placed the ball is stationary, a bright and crackling hemisphere of chakra. Anyone unfortunate enough to wander into range will receive a face-full of electricity.\n\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Upkeep: 3\n  -  Damage: 100\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Special: Paralysis 2, for 30 IC\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nThis creates a ball of energy within range on some surface. When it's created, and every 25 IC afterwards, the ball emits bolts of lightning at everyone within CHA /2 yards. Each bolt of a lightning is a separate attack.\n\nThe ball has 10 'charges'; it can attack 10 times, and then it expires. It will not attack you, and you can specify up to (Chakra Control)/10 other people who it will ignore. The ball can be attacked, and is destroyed if it takes 100 damage. Melee attacks against it cause it to discharge against the attacker.\n\nThis technique uses your base Accuracy for an B-rank Raiton, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply. The ninjutsu damage bonus is equal to yours at the time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Hiyaku Raikoui - Chain Lightning )--\nYou hold out your fingers and fire a focused bolt of lightning which then, after striking the target, goes to find a new target, then another, amplifying itself each time it passes through someone's chakra circulatory system.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Damage: 7d6*1d10\n  -  Range: 50\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 18\n\nEffects:\nThis has an Accuracy bonus equal to the severity of Paralysis its target is suffering from, +1 for every previous target it's hit. After hitting one person it can then 'jump' to any other target within half the original range from its most recent victim, doing 10% more damage for each target previously hit.\n\nAnyone struck by this technique has their Paralysis status raised by 1, and its duration increased by 5 iC. A person can only be hit by a single use of this technique once.\n\nThe maximum number of targets a single activation of Chain Lightnin can hit is equal to your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus.\n\n______________________</text>\n## A-rank\n### --( Kouken Rairyuu - Guardian Lightning Dragon )--\nHarnessing a great amount of chakra, you create a field of lightning that swirls around you and coalesces into the crackling outline of an electric dragon. From there you can keep it at the ready, or attack an unfortunate foe immediately.\n\n  -  Chakra: 54\n  -  Damage: 5d8*6d6\n  -  Range: 80\n  -  Special: Paralysis 3 for 30 IC\n  -  Speed: 26\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nWhen you use this technique, you may choose to lower its Chakra cost by 10. If you do so, rather than launching at your opponents the lightning dragon takes shape coiling around you.\n\nIt will automatically attack the first person to move within 10 yards of you (it will not, however, trigger this effect if you move closer to them), with +4 Accuracy. If they fail a status roll, its Paralysis effect will also be double.\n\nYou may also launch the dragon at any time while it's still around, as a Chakra 35, Speed 14 action, using 14 rather than 26 as its base speed.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Tenchu - Wrath of Heaven )--\nThis technique earns its name. As the handseals are completed electricity will begin to arc along the user's body and wisps of dark smoke will rise from them, a result of the overwhelming, uncontainable amounts of chakra this jutsu requires.\n\nThat chakra is converted directly into electricity and released in a blast every bit as devastatingly powerful as a genuine bolt of lightning.\n\n  -  Chakra: 70\n  -  Damage: 5d8*5d6*2d4.takeHighest(1)\n  -  Range: 100\n  -  Area: 5\n  -  Special: Paralysis 5 for 50 IC\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 50\n\nEffects:\nThis hits everything in a line ten yards across (its area), and up to one hundred yards long (i.e. anything between the user and the max range). The effectiveness of partial defense is doubled against this technique: for every 1 point it hits by, it deals 10% damage.\n\nAfter rolling damage for Tenchu, you may spend a point of Willpower to reroll it and take the higher of the two results. This may only be done once per attack, and only if you did not spend Willpower to improve Tecnhu's Accuracy.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Juurokuchuu Shibari - Sixteen Pillar Bind )--\nJust as the four pillar bind, this surrounds the area, though this time it's a bit more solid. After creating a large, oven-like structure it then electrocutes the entire area inside, frying the contents and hopefully making it hard for them to escape.\n\n  -  Chakra: 58\n  -  Upkeep: 14\n  -  Damage: 2d12*3d6\n  -  Range: 120\n  -  Area: 100\n  -  Speed: 30 \n  -  Seal Speed: 35 \n\nEffects:\nThis is a 25 x 25 AoE, inside a 50 x 50, inside a 75 x 75, inside a 100 x 100; thus, it's 25 yards from the edge of one layer to the next. For each layer a person is inside they suffer -2 Immobilize and 1 Paralyze.\n\nJuurokuchuu Shibari receives only half your ninjutsu damage bonus.\n\nThus, someone at the center would be at -8 Immobilize and Paralyze 4, until they managed to run 25 yards; then they'd be at -6 Immobilize and Paralyze 3, and so forth.\n\nThis lasts so long as you maintain its upkeep. You are immune to its effects.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Tesura Shousa - Tesla Major )--\nFilling both of your arms with an intense and energetic lightning chakra, you throw it out onto a surface. This time, instead of a small ball being produced as in Tesla Minor there is a great spire of electricity that stays in place, pulsating with energy. These usually tower over a battlefield and electrocute anything that comes within range.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Upkeep: 10\n  -  Damage: 500\n  -  Range: 50\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 30 \n\nEffects:\nThe creates a vertical spire of energy on an appropriate surface, CHA/4 yards tall.\n\nWhen created, and every 20 IC afterwards, this shocks anyone except you within (CHA)*3/4 yards. You may designate up to (Chakra Control)/5 other people who will not be targeted by the spire. This attack receives an Accuracy bonus equal to the severity of the Paralysis status on its target(s) (meaning that different people may have to defend against different accuracies).\n\nThe spire has an unlimited number of charges, and 1000 HP. It takes double damage from Fuuton, half from Doton, and if struck by a melee-range attack it immediately discharges against the attacker.\n\nYou may 'store' uses of Tesla Minor in the spire, up to a maximum of CHA/20. These will all discharge at the same time as the spire, gaining its range but keeping their own damage. For each simultaneous Tesla strike from the spire (be it a Minor or Major) that strikes someone, they suffer a Paralysis 1; if the spire and three Minors inside of it all hit somebody, that person would suffer a Paralysis 4. This lasts for 10 IC per severity of the Paralysis.\n\nThis technique uses your base Accuracy for an A-rank Katon, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply. The ninjutsu damage bonus is equal to yours at the time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Raitama - Ball Lightning )--\nUpon completion of the handseals the user forms a ball of raw, condensed lightning chakra between their palms, then encases it in a more stable 'shell' made from hundreds of interwoven chakra strands, creating a mesh-like barrier that prevents the inner chakra from dissipating.\n\nAfter that, they can either leave the resulting ball of chakra hovering where it was made or hide it inside some appropriately sized physical object, typically the ground, where it will lie in wait until someone comes close enough to trigger the mine. When they do, it seeks them out and detonates on contact.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Upkeep: 8\n  -  Damage: 300\n  -  Range: 60\n  -  Speed: 50\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nThe mine must be placed within melee range. The technique's actual range can, if you wish, be set lower than 60. Whenever someone other than you enters this range, they immediately become the target of a Sneak Attack from this jutsu; the ball of lightning soars towards them without warning.\n\nThis can be left sitting in the opponent (as an effective deterrent), or submerged into any available surface (the floor, the walls). If you are within the maximum range (even if you reduced the attack range), you can prevent the ball from activating by concentrating on it (though you'd typically need line of sight to know if this is necessary).\n\nIf this is hidden inside some object, it cannot be detected without the use of a chakra-detecting doujutsu (such as Byakugan).\n\\page_____________________\n\n### --( Shimeshi Ryouiki - Dampening Field )--\nConcentrating your chakra, you project an invisible, wide-area dome of chakra. Maintaining its stability requires you to stay practically immobile at its center, but the effects are virtually impossible to circumvent without finding the originator.\n\nAnyone who enters the field will instantly notice its presence--their hair will start to stand on end, and most objects will begin building a static charge.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Upkeep: 10\n  -  Range: Self\n  -  Area: CHA *10\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 50\n\nEffects:\nYou can move up to four yards from your original location while maintaining this technique; moving (or being forcibly moved) any further causes it to end.\n\nWithin the field, all chakra-based sensing (such as Byakugan's vision, chakra-sensory ninja, and the Yurokensei technique) has a -20 penalty. Electronic and electrical devices in this area are useless. The dampening also interferes with other lightning-based chakra, reducing the damage of all Raiton in its range to 80%.\n\nFinally, the large amounts of ambient lightning chakra interferes with earth-based chakra. Doton techniques in this area have their damage reduced by 25%, and their Chakra costs and Upkeeps (if relevant) increased by 4.\n\n______________________</text>\n\n\\page\n# Suiton Ninjutsu\n## E-rank\n### --( Suisaishuu no Jutsu - Water-Gathering Technique )--\nNo matter its advantages, it can't be denied that water suffers from one potentially crippling flaw: water is, in most environments, not widely available in the quantities needed for prolonged used of suiton jutsu.\n\nThis technique partially circumvents that problem by gathering water scattered around the battlefield and using it as part of a technique.\n\n  -  Chakra: +5\n  -  Speed: 0\n  -  Seal Speed: +4\n\nEffects:\nThis is used to supplement a technique which uses water, and increases that technique's Seal Speed by 4 and Chakra cost by 5. You may use any water that's previously been used in the battle to fuel your technique.\n\nFor example, you and your opponent both enter battle with a 4 gallon gourd. Your opponent begins by using a water ninjutsu which requires 4 gallons of water. You then use an 8-gallon technique of your own, combined with Suisaishuu, to use the (previously-expended) 4 gallons and your own 4 gallons.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Mizudama no Jutsu - Water Sphere Technique )--\nThe user gathers the water used in this technique in front of them as they perform the handseals, and then directs it at an opponent as a high-speed projectile.\n\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Damage: 2d8\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Range: 15\n  -  Speed: 7\n  -  Seal Speed: 4\n  -  Requires: 2 gallons of water\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Mizuhane - Water Splash )--\nYou strike the ground with your foot, and cause a spray of water to splash up between you and an attacker. It's not terribly practical, but it does provide about a quarter-second of a distraction.\n\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: +3\n  -  Seal Speed: 4\n  -  Requires: 4 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\nThis is used alongside a Dodge action, and provides it with a +3 bonus. It may be used with ambient (&quot;already spent&quot;) water, without needing to gather it via Water Gathering Technique.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Haneru - Splash )--\nYou use Splash!\n\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Seal Speed: 2\n\nEffects:\nNothing happens!\n\n______________________</text>\n\n## D-rank\n### --( Suiton: Teppoudama - Water Release: Liquid Bullet )--\nThe user kneads chakra and converts it into water inside their stomach, then spits it out in the form of a dense, chakra-propelled ball. Its greatest boon to suiton users is that it can be used in an area without any preexisting water.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Damage: 6d8+15\n  -  Range: 12\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 9\n\nEffects:\nThis adds 3 gallons of water to the battlefield every time it's used.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Takigakure Ryu, Mizukiri no Yaiba - Hidden Waterfall Style, Water-Cutting Blade )--\nOriginally developed by the Hidden Waterfall village, this technique has since spread into wider use. The first half of the name is generally dropped, though some choose to keep it out of respect. The jutsu creates a blade out of water, kept as strong as most metals by the chakra infusing it.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Upkeep: 1\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n  -  Requires: 4 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\nYou acquire a sword, with the appropriate attributes for any of the ones in the Equipment chapter. Attacks with this sword use your physical or ninjutsu damage bonus, whichever you prefer. The water used in this technique cannot be reused (via Suisaishuu no Jutsu) so long as the sword is maintained. This sword lasts until you let go of it.\n\nYou may perform handseals while holding this sword, but doing so increases the Seal Speed by 6, unless you can form seals one-handed.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Kirigakure no Jutsu - Hidden Mist Technique )--\nThis technique was once a specialty of the village it's named after, but has since fallen into wider use. The user diffuses a large quantity of water into the air, mixing their chakra with it to create a thick, oppressive mist.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Area: 50 yard radius\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n  -  Requires: 20 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\nThis imposes a -8 visibility penalty to everyone in the area. After you stop paying the upkeep, the mist's penalty fades at a rate of 1 per 10 IC.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Namerakana Amamizu - Water Release: Rainwater Slick )--\nThe user splashes a small area with water, infusing it with their chakra. This layer of chakra causes the water to support a person's weight for just long enough that when it gives out, they'll risk slipping and falling embarrassingly. Anything coated in this is, similarly, hard to hold on to.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Area: 15\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 9\n\nEffects:\nMake a Chakra Control roll when you first lay down this technique, with a +5 bonus.\n\nAnyone who moves while in this area must make an Athletics check against that number or be tripped (as per the E-rank Taijutsu move). Alternately, they may move at half speed and bypass that. Someone able to walk on water can move at only three-quarters speed, and still not risk tripping.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Mizutamari no Jutsu - Pool of Water Technique )--\nA moderately advanced technique is the appropriately named water-walking technique; molding chakra below one's feet to 'stand' on patches of water without any actual expenditure of energy, and, once it's perfected, only minimal concentration. This technique builds upon that concept, creating a 'cushion' of static, almost-solid water beneath each foo that the ninja stands on to avoid direct contact with the ground.\n\n  -  Chakra: 8\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n  -  Requires: 2 gallons of water, 8 Chakra Control\n\nEffects:\nThe water used in this technique is considered part of its upkeep; that is, it can't be altered, reused, or stolen by other people, or yourself, while this technique is maintained (due to your chakra in it!).\n\nYou reduce any immobilization penalties due to the condition of the ground you're crossing by 4, and ignore any other mechanical effects (such as damage for walking across caltrops) if they're C-rank or lower; if they're B-rank above, you instead halve them. This does mean that you are not directly in contact with the ground (for the purposes of, say, the Doton jutsu Shindou and Yurokensei).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Gyoushuu no Tebukuro - Gloves of Cohesion )--\nYou mold chakra around your palms to maintain a thick film of water around them, similar to how it's possible for a ninja with excellent chakra control to stand on walls, or, well, water. This uses an extension of that sort of chakra control, using the water film as a medium to latch on to other people.\n\n  -  Chakra: 8\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 5\n  -  Requires: 1 gallon of water, 10 Chakra Control\n\nEffects:\nThis gives you a +4 bonus to all grapple checks you make, for any purpose other than escaping a grapple. This technique can be used without handseals, though doing this changes it to Speed 10.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Mekkyaku - Extinguishment )--\nIt was recently discovered that covering oneself in water is a highly effective countermeasure to being on fire! Thus, this technique: An alternative to the ever-popular &quot;stop, drop, and roll&quot;, the ninja drenches themselves or a nearby object in water.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 6\n  -  Requires: X gallons of water, X Chakra control\n\nEffects:\nThis reduces any Ignite penalties you are suffering from by X/2. You have control over the water used in this technique for the next (Chakra Control)*2 IC, as if you'd carried it into battle with you via a gourd or something similar, or until you use it in a jutsu.</text>\n\\page\n## C-rank\n### --( Suiton: Suikoudan - Water Release: Water Shark Blast )--\nAfter creating the handseals, you launch water in projectile form at an opponent. Some ninja like to etch the outline of a shark's head into the end of this projectile; others, who believe that being a ninja is very serious business, prefer to omit that part of the technique. Experienced users can even use this to allow themselves to fly quickly through the water, while protecting themselves with the might of the tearing shark.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Damage: 8d12+45\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Speed: 13\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n  -  Requires: 8 gallons of water \n\nEffects:\nThis technique travels in a line from you to its target (or its maximum range). You may move to any location along that line as part of this technique, unhindered by anything which would normally prevent you from moving.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Mizurappa - Water Release: Violent Water Wave )--\nInhaling a large amount of air and performing the necessary seals, the user will expel a copious amount of water from his/her mouth.  The wave of water produced will slam against it's opponent and can then be utilized for other techniques.\n\n  -  Chakra: 16\n  -  Damage: 6d10+30\n  -  Range: 15\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nThis technique adds 5 gallons of water to the battlefield every time it's used.\n\n______________________\n\n### ### ### --( Suiton: Suiben - Water Release: Water Whip )--\nThis creates, as its name suggests, a whip made from water which is held together by chakra. Aside from being a fairly useful weapon, it can prove useful for binding enemies, as the user can direct its motions with their chakra.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Speed: 6 to create\n  -  Seal Speed: 11\n  -  Requires: 6 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\nYou may attack with the whip, which is a Speed 10 action, Range 8, Damage 6d10, Chakra 12 and uses the higher of your physical or ninjutsu damage bonus. You must keep one hand on the whip at all times, or it will break apart into so much water.\n\nAs a separate Speed 10 action, you may use the whip to grab hold of someone, as per the E-rank Grapple technique. You use your CHA rather than your STR for grapple checks using the whip. Your opponent is considered to be 'grappling' the whip. Although they cannot attack it directly, the whip has (your CHA)/2 HP, and can be attacked (or suffer from being struck by an AoE) by outside sources. The whip being destroyed ends the grapple. Your whip cannot be attacked if it is not being used to grapple someone. The victim cannot shift this grapple, only break it.\n\nYou can then proceed to perform any valid Grapple techniques which you know, of C-rank or below, using your CHA in place of your STR. This is accomplished by using your chakra to reshape the whip. The following techniques may not be used by the whip: Headbutt, Suplex, Pressure Point.\n\nYou may still perform handseals while holding the whip, but it increases their seal speed by 8 unless you have the ability to perform handseals one-handed.\n\nAdditionally, you may direct Raiton techniques through the whip. This may be done with techniques of E- and D-rank. It may done with a C-rank technique, but doing so destroys the whip in the process. These techniques cannot miss.\n\n______________________\n\n### ### --( Suiton: Mizuame Nabara - Water Release: Syrup Capture Field )--\nThe user converts chakra into water, and infuses it with enough chakra to alter its composition, making it extremely viscous. They then spit it out in a stream of sticky, highly adhesive liquid.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15 + X\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Area: 5 + X\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nThis covers a circular area, and its cost may be increased to widen that area's radius. If a person has the ability to walk on water, they may cross this area without difficulty.\n\nHowever, if someone is forced into it (such as by being pushed back by certain jutsu), or is already in the area (i.e. it's targeting them and they fail to dodge), they are stuck in the syrup. Anyone in the area suffers a -4 immobilization penalty, and additionally has their movement speed halved.\n\nThis jutsu's effects persist even after the upkeep stops being paid. However, so long as the upkeep is maintained, the user may control the syrup enough to have it try to 'grab' anyone using water-walking to cross it unaffected; if the attack hits, the person is stuck in the syrup as if they weren't using water-walking.  This is a Speed 6 action, with a Chakra cost of 10.\n\nDue to the alterations to this water to make it highly viscous, it cannot be used later to fuel other suiton techniques.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Mizu Souzou no Jutsu - Water Creation Technique )--\nYou convert raw chakra into pure water. This technique is popular among serious users of suiton techniques, as it lets them avoid picking and choosing their battles so carefully, and allows them to eschew the practice of carrying around large gourds of water (which, in addition to giving away their specialty, are unpleasantly heavy).\n\n  -  Chakra: 5 + 2 * X\n  -  Speed: 4\n  -  Seal Speed: X\n\nEffects:\nYou create X gallons of water. This may be used alongside a technique, in which case its speed is 0, and its cost and seal speed are added to that technique's, and it contributes directly to that techniques gallons requirement. It may also be used alone, in which case the created water is deposited on the battlefield (and must be gathered via a method such as Suisaishuu).\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Mizu Bunshin no Jutsu - Water Clone Technique )--\nAn advanced form of the standard Bunshin no Jutsu, this creates clones out of water. Since they're solid (well, relatively) these clones can be used to perform tasks the user is unable or unwilling to do for themselves. While they're weaker than their user, they can still prove dangerous in combat.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10, +3 per clone\n  -  Speed: 6, +1 per clone\n  -  Seal Speed: 4, +2 per clone\n  -  Requires: 4 gallons per clone\n\nEffects:\nThese function like normal clones, but you may direct them to take actions by spending your AP. They may use basic unarmed attacks, or basic weapon attacks (weapons can be added to clones when they're created for 1 gallon per 5 dice of weaponry). These clones use your regular attributes, but use your ninjutsu damage bonus as their physical damage bonus. A water clone which takes damage from any source is destroyed.\n\n[1 AP] Dodge, or Parry.\n\n[Variable AP] Move: The clone may move around the battlefield. This costs 1 AP per 2 IC it spends moving.\n\n[Variable AP] The clone may make any basic unarmed or weapon attack, by paying 1 AP per 2 Speed of that action.\n\n[10 AP] The clone can use itself to create a water prison (as per Suiton: Suirou no Jutsu). This is considered a Speed 14 action, and you must pay the Chakra cost. These water prisons require no additional water; the clone remains present, but can take no other non-defensive actions, while maintaining them. They last for 5 + (your Chakra Control ranks) IC, after which the clone expires and the prison ends; if you go to the prison you can take it over, and from then on must keep one hand in contact with it as per the normal rules for that technique. When the prison ends, the clone is destroyed.\n\n\nWhen Water Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category.\n\nWater Clones use your base Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion bonuses, as if they were a Fatigue 0 version of you without any temporary benefits (such as having eaten a Soldier Pill before creating them). If a clone fails a Fatigue roll, it vanishes just as if it had been struck.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Mizugakure no Jutsu - Hidden in Water Technique )--\nThe user sinks into a shallow pool of water, much too little to actually fit a person (it's ninja magic, don't ask questions), where they'll be able to easily lie in wait for a target to pass by, or spy on someone who might be near.\n\n  -  Chakra: 18\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nPerforming this jutsu requires a sizable puddle (at least two gallons worth if you're pouring out the water, though if there was recent rainfall, it's assumed you can find such a puddle without much difficulty). If at least 50 gallons of water have been used in a fight, it's assumed there's enough water around somewhere to use this.\n\nYou can hide (assuming you meet one of the normal three requirements for hiding), and immediately enter Stealth 3 when hidden. If an opponent does not have a reason to suspect you're there (i.e. this isn't being done in-combat) you have a +5 Stealth bonus. You have awareness equivalent to being able to look out of the pool as if it's a window.\n\nThe puddle being destroyed or evaporated, or washed away in more water, results in you being harmlessly ejected.\n\nNotably, this can only be used in puddles; anything more than a few inches deep probably doesn't qualify. If it's an actual pond, or lake, or the like, it's not a valid target.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Suirou no Jutsu - Water Release: Water Prison Technique )--\nThe user gathers the chakra around their hand, and forms the required water into a sphere which encloses its victim. Due to the density of the chakra used in this technique, the water is stronger than steel. It is not, however, airtight.\n\nYeah, don't ask how that works. We don't know either.\n\n  -  Chakra: 18\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n  -  Requires: 12 gallons of water\n\nEffects: \nIf this jutsu strikes, the victim is trapped inside a sphere of water. People inside cannot take actions, but they also cannot be affected by anything outside the prison; yes, that's right, the water can even stop giant swords. It makes sense, honestly, we promise, somehow.\n\nAnyone with a Chakra Control skill of 5 or above is able to mold the chakra around them to allow themselves to siphon air through the prison, meaning they can still talk and breathe. Anything with less, however, adds a Suffocation 1 status every 10 IC.\n\nTo maintain the water prison, you must keep one hand on it. Dodging requires you to end the effect; if you take damage, you must make a Chakra Control check against (damage taken)/10 or the prison ends. Although you can't move, you can still take most other actions that are possible one-handed while maintaining the prison's upkeep.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Umi no Tate no Jutsu - Ocean Shield Technique )--\nA derivative of a more advanced technique, this was created to help teach up-and-coming suiton users the foundations of that jutsu, and help keep them alive until they were skilled enough to learn it. It creates a circular barrier of water around you, which surges up to protect you from... well, whatever convinced you that you'd need to use this technique.\n\n  -  Chakra: 17\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n  -  Requires: 10 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\nMake an accuracy roll against an incoming attack, with a bonus of your ninjutsu damage bonus. This technique's Accuracy bonus can't exceed its final, modified Speed (not including any increases in Speed from the Paralysis status).\n\nIf you meet or exceed the attack's accuracy, you protect yourself from it completely. This works against Katon up to B-rank, Doton up to D-rank, and all other jutsu (including taijutsu) up to C-rank.</text>\n\n## B-rank\n### --( Suiton: Suigadan - Water Release: Water Fang Bullet )--\nThis move forms multiple pressurized, spiralling columns of water that have a drill-like ability to pierce and destroy their target. As this attack can originate from any body of water (rather than being shot directly from the attacker), in the right environments this has a 360 degree range of attack, making it incredibly difficult to defend against adequately.\n\n  -  Chakra: 34\n  -  Damage: 10d20+60\n  -  Range: 35\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n  -  Requires: 22 gallons\n\nEffects:\nIf there are at least 50 gallons of water on the battlefield (or one is, say, over a lake, river, or other body of water), this technique is automatically a Surprise Attack, and the water it uses does not have to be gathered in advance. This technique inflicts Piercing wounds.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Suiryuudan - Water Release: Water Dragon Blast )--\nThis technique shapes a large amount of water into a giant, dragon-shaped projectile which seeks out and crashes into whoever you direct it at. What it lacks for in complexity, it makes up for by being a highly effective tool in any suiton-using shinobi's arsenal.\n\n  -  Chakra: 33\n  -  Damage: 14d20+140\n  -  Range: 50\n  -  Special: Stun 10\n  -  Speed: 18\n  -  Seal Speed: 22\n  -  Requires: 24 gallons of water\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Sution: Suijinheki - Water Release: Water Encampment Wall )--\nThis defensive technique creates a wall of water around you, which forms a violently churning defensive perimeter. When lacking water in the environment to use, a talented shinobi can form it in their stomach and spit it out.\n\n  -  Chakra: 26\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n  -  Requires: 16 gallons of water, or +8 chakra cost without using water\n\nEffects:\nIf using Suijinheki as an interrupt: Make an accuracy roll against the attack's accuracy, with a bonus equal to your ninjutsu damage bonus; if you succeed, this stops the attack entirely. This technique's Accuracy bonus can't exceed its final, modified Speed (not including any increases in Speed from the Paralysis status).\n\nOnce Suijinheki has been deployed, it lasts for your damage bonus in initiative counts--it stops any other incoming attacks automatically, without having to roll. You may also end it early, if you need to move or attack through it.\n\nThis technique protects you from any Katon up to A-rank, Doton up to C-rank, and all other techniques (including taijutsu) up to B-rank.\n\nIf you create the water used in Suijinheki (i.e. pay the +8 chakra cost), then that water is added to the battlefield after its duration expires.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Bakusui Shouha - Water Release: Exploding Water Shockwave )--\nThe user creates an enormous amount of water by spewing it from their mouth, flooding the battlefield and potentially crushing foes in its path. Best of all, they get to look awesome while doing it! The wave rises up from beneath the user, and they can 'ride' it to its destination.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Damage: 10d12+80\n  -  Area: Special\n  -  Special: Cannot be dodged. Stun 8.\n  -  Speed: 16, cannot be reduced below 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nThis adds 50+(ninjutsu damage bonus)*5 gallons of water to the battlefield.  When performing this technique, you may move up to half its Area in yards, in any direction. The Area itself is centered on where you start your movement.\n\nAnyone other than yourself within a yard radius equal to the number of gallons takes damage from this technique.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Benzaiten no Jutsu - River Goddess Technique )--\nNamed after the deity who supposedly watches over a major river, this technique coats the user's body with a thin layer of chakra-infused water. It offers no real protection from impacts or weapons, but can be an effective supplement to one's defenses against heat and other unpleasantness.\n\n  -  Chakra: 23\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n  -  Requires: 12 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\nSo long as this is maintained you cannot be affected by Ignite or Burn statuses, and you take 25% less damage from Katon jutsu (applied after other reductions). Activating it will end any ongoing Ignites harmlessly, but will not cure Burns.\n\nYou may use the water in this technique to fuel any Suiton jutsu you use, though doing so ends its effect--but, does allow you to avoid sufferings Benzaiten's Upkeep on that jutsu's Chakra roll.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Takitsubo no Jutsu: Water Release: Waterfall Basin Technique )--\nThis technique draws water up from underground, forming a geyser on the surface. Aside from being useful for creating a spot to relax when resting or camping out, and ensuring you'll always have a source of clean (well... for a certain value of clean) water, it, like most ninjutsu, has combat applications.\n\n  -  Chakra: 24\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 18\n\nEffects:\nThis produces 2 gallon of water on the battlefield every 3 IC, for a total of 50 gallons over 75 IC. It's certainly possible to have multiple instances of this jutsu running simultaneously, from multiple people, or the same person.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Suishi no Jutsu - Water Release: Water Drowning Technique )--\nAn advanced version of the ever-popular Water Prison Technique, this remedies the greatest flaw in that technique: a lack of lethality. It does... about what it says. In terms of appearances, it's almost identical to a regular water prison.\n\n  -  Chakra: 28\n  -  Speed: 18\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n  -  Requires: 16 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\nThis follows all normal rules for the Water Prison Technique, with the following exceptions.\n\nThe victim suffers from Suffocation 1 every 5 IC regardless of their Chakra Control. By spending 1 Willpower, they are allowed a 1d20+CHA/10+(5 per Fatigue category) roll against your 1d20+CHA/10+(ninjutsu damage bonus). They also get one such check whenever they advance a Fatigue category inside the prison, and when you first strike them with it. Success means they break free.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Hijutsu: Kirisame - Secret Technique: Mist Rain )--\nThis technique causes it to start raining over a small (well, for... rain) area. This rain is chakra-infused, and will siphon away any chakra which doesn't match its own (in other words, its creator's); fallen rain evaporates rapidly, only to fall again, and shrouds the area in a thick mist.\n\n  -  Chakra: 32\n  -  Upkeep: 10\n  -  Area: 120 yards\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 22\n  -  Requires: 32 gallons of water, or +10 Chakra cost\n\nEffects:\nAny jutsu which is used inside the mist, or includes the mist as any part of its area, acts as if its user's ninjutsu damage bonus is 0 for any associated damage calculations. Additionally, being inside the mist causes a -8 visibility penalty. You suffer only half the normal visibility penalty from your own Mist Rain.\n\nThe water used in this technique is returned to the battlefield after you end its upkeep. If you created the water (i.e. paid the +10 Chakra cost), then 32 gallons are added to the battlefield. Water that's part of this technique can't be used for other purposes while it's ongoing.\n\nIf you move, you may cause the mist to 'follow' you; it can move up to half your ninjutsu damage bonus in yards per IC, so long as you remain within it.\n\nIf this mist has its visibility penalty reduced (such as by the E-rank Fuuton, Cleansing Winds) then it regains 1 point of its penalty every 5 IC that pass. On the other hand, effects which remove it entirely (such as the A-rank Fuuton, The North Wind) will, indeed, remove it. If Mist Rain ends because you stop paying the Upkeep, it will remain for the next 20 IC (as the rain finishes falling) before finally, truly ending.\n\nThis technique may only be used outside.</text>\n## A-rank\n### --( Suiton: Suiryuuben - Water Release: Water Dragon Whip )--\nThis jutsu creates a levitating orb of water which can project numerous whips and tendrils of water. These tendrils can be guided to targets by remote manipulation of the orb's chakra, even changing direction in mid-trajectory to find their targets. On top of that, they're sharp-tipped and more than capable of perforating opponents many times over.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Upkeep: 14\n  -  Damage: 10d10+75\n  -  Range: 40 + 5 * (ninjutsu damage bonus)\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 35\n  -  Requires: 200 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\nSo long as you maintain this technique, your pet giant levitating ball of water will fight for you! It can take the following actions, by spending your AP:\n\n[X AP] Move: Your pet water ball can fly around and stuff! It moves as if it had taken a Speed (X)*5 action, using your CHA in place of its AGI. It cannot (deliberately) move outside its max range. If it does end up outside that range, it can take no actions other than moving towards you.\n\n[5 AP] Attack: Your water ball attacks anyone within half this technique's max range, doing the listed damage if it hits. It uses your accuracy, with your CHA/10 in place of DEX/10. This does piercing damage. You may target any number of people within range, increasing the AP cost by 1 for each person after the first. This receives your damage bonus as if it was a Speed 10 action. This does Piercing damage.\n\n\nThis technique uses your base Accuracy for an A-rank Suiton, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply. The ninjutsu damage bonus is equal to yours at the time you use the technique. Because the attacks are made by the technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP).\n\n\nThis technique cannot be converted into an advanced chakra nature (such as Mokuton).\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Daibakufu - Water Release: Great Waterfall )--\nThis is one of the most powerful water ninjutsu in existence; once the appropriate seals are formed, the user unleashes a devastating tidal wave which tears across the battlefield like a scaled-down tsunami, knocking aside people, trees, and small buildings in its path.\n\nLong ago, exceptionally skilled shinobi were able to fill their impromptu waterfall with all manner of weapons, which were propelled within the wave at incredible speeds. This had the effect of making it an almost unavoidably deadly technique that would leave pools of blood mixed in with the water. However, use of that aspect of the technique was forbidden due to its unbelievable power, and as peace settled across the lands the secret of how to do that was lost.\n\n  -  Chakra: 52\n  -  Damage: 24d20+300\n  -  Range: 80\n  -  Area: 20 wide, up to max range in length; may be used as a smaller area if you wish\n  -  Special: Stun 14\n  -  Speed: 36\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n  -  Requires: 60 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\n40 of the gallons used in this technique are removed from the battlefield, scattered as a fine mist over the area; if the gallon requirement is somehow removed, this technique's Chakra cost is increased by 8.\n\nBlocking reduces this technique's Stun by half.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Daikoudan - Water Release: Great Shark Blast )--\nThis creates an enormous shark out of water and sends it crashing across the battlefield at whichever party has offended the user sufficiently for them to feel the need to do so. Aside from impacting its primary target, the shark is massive enough to cause significant collateral damage.\n\nThe technique's true secret, however, is its ability to absorb any chakra it comes in contact with and use that energy to further empower itself.\n\n  -  Chakra: 44\n  -  Damage: 15d20+200\n  -  Range: 60\n  -  Area: 20\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 26\n  -  Requires: 40 gallons of water\n\nEffects:\nIf used as an Interrupt, you may choose to reduce this technique's Seal Speed by 10 and increase its Chakra cost by 10. Used as a normal attack, it does full damage to a single target, and half damage to everyone within its Area who doesn't defend against it.\n\nAs an Interrupt, it can be used to counter any ranged ninjutsu attack. Daikoudan may be used to Interrupt techniques so long as its Speed is equal to or less than theirs. The two attacks collide, and their damage is compared. For this comparison, treat Katon technqiues as dealing 25% less damage, and Doton as dealing 25% more.\n\nIf the incoming attack does more damage, you are hit by it, but it has its damage reduced by half.\n\nIf Daikoudan's damage is greater, it becomes an attack against the opponent with +5 Accuracy, along with any Accuracy bonuses (but not penalties) of the attack it countered. It does an additional (X)*10 damage, where X is the Chakra cost of the move it countered.\n\nSimilarly, if a ninjutsu-based defense is used against Daikoudan, and fails to stop it completely, it does full damage (bypassing even partial defense) and adds (X)*10 damage, with X being the Chakra cost of the failed defense.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Dai Bakusui Shouha - Water Release: Great Exploding Water Shockwave )--\nA stronger version of the B-rank Exploding Water Shockwave, the user spits out a truly prodigious amount of water.\n\n  -  Chakra: 55\n  -  Upkeep: 7\n  -  Area: 150\n  -  Special: Stun 20\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 32\n\nEffects:\nThis adds 200+(ninjutsu damage bonus)*20 gallons of water to the battlefield.  So long as there are at least 200 gallons of water on the battlefield, any techniques which function by altering the condition of the ground (such as Syrup Capture Field, or Retsodotensho) are effectively useless. In Dai Bakusui Shouha's area, there is always considered sufficient water to use jutsu without having to resort to using Water-Gathering (it essentially creates a small lake).\n\nThe water created forms a flattened orb over the affected area, with the user anchored at its center. So long as the upkeep is maintained, this water will follow them, and the below effects will be maintained (when the upkeep ends, so do they, as the water disperses over a much larger area; it remains usable, but isn't a mobile lake).\n\nAdditionally, anyone who can't stand on water will begin sinking. They can swim at half their normal movement speed (movement-increasing jutsu typically will not work), and until they've exited the area suffer Suffocation 1 every 10 IC. Alternately, they can take a Speed 5 action to stay at the surface for the next 15 IC.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Suiton: Uramiame - Water Release: Grudge Rain )--\nAs a weather-manipulation jutsu, this technique is extremely taxing upon its user. Upon its completion a large storm cloud is created, which proceeds to, as storm clouds are prone to do, rain. This rain saps the chakra from anyone it comes in contact with, and transfers it through the pooling water to the technique's user.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Upkeep: 8\n  -  Area: 100\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 24\n\nEffects:\nEvery 2 IC, everyone other than the user and up to (Chakra Control)/5 people they've designated as allies has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty increased by 1, and the user has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty decreased by 1 per person present affected by the rain. This remains centered on the user as they move.</text>\n\n\\page\n# Medical Jutsu\n## D-rank\n### --( Mukizu Shindan no Jutsu - Flawless Diagnosis Technique )--\nBy touching someone and sending pulses of chakra throughout the recipient's tenketsu, the user can learn of someone's vitals and condition faster than it would be to separately evaluate them.  It requires the patient be willing to do so, however, which is the cause of most medic-nin's stress while in training.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 8, Delay 8\n\nEffects:\nYou know a target's Fatigue level, percent of remaining HP and Vitality, any wounds they're suffering from, any illnesses they have, any poisons they're afflicted with, and any other health issues they may be suffering from.\n\nThese are in general terms. Your character knows they are &quot;exhausted, but still have some energy left&quot;, not that they &quot;are at Fatigue 4&quot;.\n\nIn addition to telling you what's wrong with a person, this gives a +5 bonus to any Medicine rolls to treat a person using mundane means (such as a First Aid kit).\n\nThis cannot be used against an unwilling target. Well; it can't be used on an unwilling target who is also capable of resisting.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kyuusho Shuuzen no Jutsu - Vital Repair Technique )--\nBy transferring your chakra to the recipient, you can stimulate the body to begin the recovery process and help stabilize their most basic functions (like breath rate and pulse).  It lacks the precision of more advanced jutsu to target specific injuries and problems, but helps to keep people alive until they can receive advanced care.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 5 + X * 2\n  -  Special: Abort\n  -  Requires: Flawless Diagnosis\n\nEffects:\nFor the duration of this technique, you must keep your hands on its recipient. If you are stunned, or knocked away, it is Aborted automatically. The value of X is determined, and the Chakra cost paid, after it ends.\n\nFor every IC which passes, you heal 5 of the recipient's lost Hit Points. This will not restore lost Vitality, though it will restore a person in negative Hit Points to consciousness.\n\nYou pay the cost of this technique after you finish healing, based on its actual duration. If you Abort it, or are forced to, X is reduced appropriately.\n\nA single person may benefit from this only once per day, per medic. You may use this technique on yourself (though still have to be able to place a hand on yourself to do so; no hands, no healing).\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Shiketsu no Jutsu - Tourniquet Technique )--\nA surprisingly medical technique, this throttles the flow of chakra to a specific portion of the body, and by doing so puts it in a state of near-hibernation. The entire limb becomes numb and almost unresponsive, but blood flow decreases and pains is significantly reduced.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Upkeep: 2 per limb\n  -  Speed: 15, Delay 5\n  -  Requires: Flawless Diagnosis\n\nEffects:\nThis jutsu can be applied to any limb. The recipient loses the use of that limb, but ignores all effects of any wounds present on it.\n\nIn the case of an arm that means it cannot be used to hold weapons, the amount of weapons you can multi-throw is reduced by 25%, and you cannot use that hand to form handseals.\n\nIn the case of an leg this applies a -25% to movement speed and a -1 dodge penalty.\n\nThis technique cannot be used offensively. You can, however, use it on yourself.</text>\n## C-rank\n### --( Chakura no Mesu - Chakra Scalpel )--\nThis forms one's chakra into a small, sharp blade; medics favor this for performing highly accurate incisions during surgeries and dissection, as it won't lose its edge and is always sterile (unlike a regular blade). It can even be used to make cuts inside the body without creating an opening wound, which drastically reduces the risk of infection.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nYou can use this in combat. Doing so causes your basic unarmed taijutsu attacks to inflict Slashing wounds and ignore any damage reduction your opponent may have. However, these 'scalpel' injuries are relatively shallow. They cannot injure a location wearing armor, and do not damage armor when they strike it.\n\nThe more skilled a medic is, the more effectively they'll be able to weaponize what's meant to be a surgical technique. The damage from Chakra Scalpel attacks is increased by (your Medicine skill ranks)%. Aditionally, its damage (after that increase) is increased by (Medicine skill ranks)% for determining the severity of wounds it inflicts.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Kasoku Saikassei - Accelerated Revitalization )--\nAn advanced medical technique which temporarily allows the body to sustain itself by accelerating the body's metabolism and chakra reserves.  It was originally developed to extend the medic's usefulness in prolonged missions, but has been expanded since.  It is used sparingly because of how long it takes to recover from, and how it tends to leave people comatose afterward.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X * 3\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Upkeep: X * 2\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Requires: Flawless Diagnosis\n\nEffects:\nThis lowers the recipient's effective Fatigue level by X, with X having a maximum of their current Fatigue level.\n\nA person can only benefit from one application of this technique. To apply it again, they must first release the previous instance of it--which may, potentially, render them immediately unconscious, if their &quot;true&quot; Fatigue level is 6 or higher. Notably, an unconscious person cannot benefit from this technique.\n\nHowever, forcing one's body beyond its limits like this is costly. For the next X weeks, the recipient will not recover from Fatigue at all, even through the use of Soldier Pills (though another application of this technique would still function). If multiple instances of Kasoku Saikassei are delaying one's recovery, only the one with the longest time remaining is counted for that purpose.\n\nThis technique cannot be used offensively.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kizu Saishuu no Jutsu - Wound Sealing Technique )--\nThis technique uses chakra to make repairs to an injured body; gashes are pulled shut, wounds sutured, damaged organs held steady by the application of chakra. This can give an injured shinobi  the second wind they need to win a battle or complete a mission.\n\nHowever, this is only a temporary measure; before long the chakra will unravel. As such, this is considered an emergency technique among medics, to be used only when there's no other choice. Most will hesitate to apply this to their comrades, as far too many shinobi will prove willing to, using this newfound health, charge into battle, defeat their enemies, and then die hours later when their borrowed time expires.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 30, Delay 20\n  -  Requires: Vital Repair Technique\n\nEffects:\nThe recipient immediately regains up (25 + (your ninjutsu damage bonus)*2)% of their maximum Vitality, which will not take them above their maximum. However, (your ninjutsu damage bonus) hours later, their wounds will reopen; they'll immediately take that much damage, +10%, which cannot be reduced or mitigated. Until this occurs, they will not heal normally (i.e. as described in the Recovery section of the Combat chapter).\n\nThis can be fatal.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Rinji Hougou no Jutsu - Temporary Suture Technique )\nWeaving a network of chakra, a medic can make short-term repairs to damaged body parts. They can set wounds and hold them rigidly in place, use chakra to take the place of damage muscles and tendons, alleviate swelling and bruising, or even repair damaged blood vessels and do the job of injured nerves.\n\nThe problem with this is that it's a short-term fix to a long-term problem. This is itself damaging, but beyond that it prevents the body from doing anything to repair itself, and allows undue strain to be placed on these injured body parts.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15 + 3 * X\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 10 + 3 * X, Delay 5 + X\n  -  Requires: Tourniquet Technique\n\nEffects:\nThis temporarily negates the effects of up to X wounds; it can be applied later to negate additional wounds, without disrupting previous applications.\n\nThis lasts for (the medic's ninjutsu damage bonus) hours, after which time the chakra sustaining the jutsu expires--and the recipient pays the price for pushing their body beyond its limits.\n\nFor each wound remedied this way, they take damage equal to 5% of their maximum Vitality, per category of the wound. Thus, if this was used to negate a Minor and a Severe wound, after it ended the person would take (5 + 15) = 20% of their maximum Vitality in damage (which could carry over to their HP), which cannot be reduced or mitigated.\n\nAdditionally, the recovery times of these wounds is increases by 1 week per level of the wound (1 week for minors, 3 for severes, etc.). In the case of wounds whose penalties are reduced over time, this &quot;extra&quot; recovery time must be made up for first, before normal recovery can continue.\n\nThis can be fatal. It cannot be used on an unwilling subject (though as with its predecessor, Tourniquet Technique, you may use it on yourself). So long as this technique is in place, natural healing (as described in the Recovery section of the Combat chapter) will not take place.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Meguri Seigyo no Jutsu - Hemostasis Technique )--\nAlthough this technique is fairly simple, it's not taught to amateur medics due to the danger inherent in making any sort of mistake when applying it. This temporarily adjusts the recipient's pulse and blood flow, putting their body in a more stable condition. This is mainly used to prevent someone from bleeding out, and to prevent the spread of poison.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X * 2\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 6 + X, Delay X / 2\n\nEffects:\nThis lasts for X * 5 IC. During that time, the damage the recipient takes from Bleed effects is reduced to 0, the Stamina penalties from Bleed effects is not applied, and they take damage from Poison once every 2 IC, rather than every IC. The severity of Bleed statuses is reduced normally. During this time, they have a +5 bonus to all their Resistance rolls.</text>\n\n## B-rank\n### --( Shousen no Jutsu - Mystical Palm Technique )--\nIn many ways the pinnacle of medical ninjutsu, this allows the user to dramatically accelerate the body's natural healing process by using chakra to stimulate it. This lets them heal a patient without the need for medical equipment, surgery, or even ordinary healing times. Despite the incredible skill required in matching the distribution of chakra to the severity of injuries, this looks incredibly simple: the medic places their faintly-glowing palms on the recipient, and injuries begin to vanish.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X / 2\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 5 + X\n  -  Special: Abort\n  -  Requires: Vital Repair\n\nEffects:\nFor the duration of this technique, you must keep your hands on its recipient. If you are stunned, or knocked away, it is Aborted automatically. The value of X is determined, and the Chakra cost paid, after it ends. This paragraph should seem familiar.\n\nEvery IC which passes, you heal 10 of the recipient's Vitality. This will not heal lost Hit Points.\n\nYou pay the cost of this technique after you finish healing, based on its actual duration. If you Abort it, or are forced to, X is reduced appropriately. A single person may benefit from this only once per day, per medic.\n\nYou may use this technique on yourself, as with Vital Repair.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fukugen Ryouhou - Rejuvenating Remedy )--\nAn advanced technique in which, with a touch, the user sends a pulse of chakra throughout the body of their target, which corrects disrupts in the user's chakra flow and the nerves and blood vessels which they follow throughout the body.  It is widely rumored to have been developed by a Hyuuga medic-nin.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nThis clears the person touched of immobilization and paralysis penalties which are internal (Poison, clay bullet, etc. would not apply, but notably, Combat Acupuncture and Nervous System Derangement would).  It immediately ends any stuns which are presently affecting them.\n\nIt is also strong enough to disrupt weaker Genjutsu, granting another defensive roll against a single Genjutsu affecting them of C rank or lower, with a +5 bonus.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Saikan Chuushutsu no Jutsu - Delicate Illness Extraction Technique )--\nAn delicate and advanced technique even among medical ninjutsu, this is nonetheless exceptionally useful. The medic makes an incision on the patient's body (usually the torso, but other locations are possible) and then uses chakra to draw out any poisons, toxins, or other pathogens that may be afflicting the person.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 18, Delay 8\n  -  Requires: Chakra Scalpel\n\nEffects:\nThis immediately cures any poisons a person may be suffering from. Most parasites and chemical toxins can also be excised this way. Despite its name, however, it is not able to actually cure diseases or viruses.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Kyouka Shohou: Chakura Chuunyuu - Strengthening Prescription: Chakra Injection )--\nOriginaly developed as a kinjutsu, the version used by medics today is a safer (though still by no means safe) derivative. Using medically-altered chakra, an individual can be greatly, if temporarily, strengthened. Unfortunately, they are burning their proverbial candle at both ends when under the effects of this technique.\n\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 25, Delay 20\n\nEffects:\nThe recipient has their ninjutsu and physical damage bonuses increased by one half of your ninjutsu damage bonus, and receives a bonus to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to your ninjutsu damage bonus.\n\nHowever, whenever they fail a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll, their Fatigue is raised an additional category. Additionally, any time their Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion penalty increases, the other is increased by the same amount.</text>\n\n## A-rank\n### --( Ranshinshou - Nervous System Derangement )--\nUpon making contact with the enemy, the user converts their chakra into actual electricity and sends it through the nervous system of the user. This disrupts the signals that are sent to the brain from the various limbs and muscles, making the wrong muscle flex or move when you try to say..move your arm. In the end, you just flail on the ground.\n\n  -  Chakra: 55\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 25 \n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts a -12 Immobilization penalty that can only be reduced by spending AP at a rate of 10 AP per -1, which may be done as a Speed 1 action. While this penalty is -10 or more, you cannot do anything (Defend, Attack, Anything.). It cannot be reduced below -5 until after 100 IC have passed.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Chikatsu Saisei no Jutsu - Healing Resuscitation Regeneration Technique )--\nThe pinnacle of advanced medical jutsu, with effects that border upon miraculous, this stimulates the body's stem cells to begin dividing and recreating a lost or destroyed part of the body--such as a limb or organ. In time, full functionality will be regained.\n\nDoing so, however, is incredibly difficult, even for experienced medical nin. In the rare instance when this technique is performed, multiple medics will usually work in tandem.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Speed: 100\n  -  Seal Speed: 200\n\nEffects:\nA medic involved in this technique makes the Chakra roll, and then spends 1 Willpower towards the regeneration process. A total of 100 Willpower must be spent this way, but the process cannot be completed in less than 10 weeks;  at least 1 Willpower must be spent each week, or all progress is lost. After the last point of Willpower is added, the user regains their lost limb, organ, or body part.\n\nDuring this time, the recipient cannot go above Fatigue 2. If they do, at any point and for any reason, all progress is lost.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kyuushou Taisha - Vital Regeneration )--\nThe medic-nin focuses their chakra on a specific part of the body and, using what is left of the damaged organ or area, forces a rapid replication of specific types of cells.  It is capable of mending broken bones and repairing ruptured organs with astonishing speed.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20 + 10 * X\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 50, Delay 40\n  -  Requires: Mystical Palm\n\nEffects:\nThis completely cures one wound the recipient is suffering from. X is 1 per severity of the wound (1 for minor, 4 for critical). However, for the next X * 4 weeks, the healed individual's Fatigue is considered 1 higher for all purposes; in the case of Critical wounds, their Fatigue is considered 2 higher. Multiple uses of this stack.\n\nFor example, say you had a Critical wound and a Major wound cured on the same day. You would be perpetually at Fatigue 3 for the next 2 * 4 = 8 OOC days. After that, there would still be 8 more days (for a total of 16, for the Critical wound) of being unable to go below Fatigue 2. If you had another two Severe wounds healed this way in that time, you'd be at Fatigue 4 until the after-effects started wearing off.\n\nAlthough most experienced medics know this technique, they are typically reluctant to cure every individual who injures themselves in training or on a mission. Most medics believe that even if the person doesn't need to learn a lesson for their mistakes, it's better to heal naturally (with a little bit of help when necessary) than to send a weakened, but technically uninjured, ninja back into danger.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Mikiri Saisei - Forsaken Rebirth )--\nA powerful, but potentially dangerous, technique, this allows the medic to transform a portion of their 'life energy' to another individual. Originally, this had no limitatuons; a medic could easily kill themselves  bring an ally back from the brink of death, which earned the technique its name. Over time, such extreme measures became less necessary (medics capable of using it were, after all, generally more valuable to the village than anyone they might be healing), and the version of the technique taught to medical nin was altered to prevent that.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 20, Delay 10\n\nEffects:\nAfter paying the chakra cost, you may 'spend' additional Fatigue levels (though you may not render yourself unconscious by doing this) to improve this technique's effects. In fact, without spending Fatigue this way, it does nothing at all. You may not use this technique on yourself.\n\nEach Fatigue level heals 20% of the recipient's HP and 10% of their Vitality, and lowers their Fatigue level by by 1, in addition to resetting their Chakra and Stamina penalties to 0.\n\nEach Fatigue level also allows them to ignore one wound they already have of their choice for the next X in-character days, where X is the total number of Fatigue spent. All their Minor wounds must be ignored before this can move on to Major, and all their Major before they can move on to Severe. This cannot be used to ignore Critical wounds.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shikon no Jutsu - Dead Soul Technique )--\nYou can reanimate a corpse for a limited amount of time, forcing its heart to beat, organs to appear to function, and chakra to circulate, through careful and precise application of your own chakra. Skilled medical shinobi can completely erase any signs of injury to the corpse, and remove the usual associated smell.\n\nThis technique is not actually as difficult as it might seem. It's not even a proper jutsu, just something it becomes very easy for a sufficiently skilled medic to figure out on their own. However, even shinobi have standards, and for most medics this crosses that line.\n\nThus, while it's not strictly forbidden, there is a very strong stigma attached to its use, especially within the medical community.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Upkeep: 10\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\nEffects:\nThis may target any human corpse which has died in the past (Medicine skill ranks)/2 hours, as long as it has not suffered any Severe or Critical wounds. This technique erases all signs of it being a dead body, and any signs of injury the medic chooses (some may be left in place, to make it more convincing).\n\nYou can control this body by minute adjustments of chakra; you do not need to move, only concentrate (and continue to pay the Upkeep), to do so. Once this technique has been applied, the body begins deteriorating rapidly; after (Medicine skill ranks)/3 hours it will be too badly decayed to function. The jutsu will end, and it will appear to have been dead for several days (it will be desiccated, but not decayed, as microbes and vermin will not have actually been consuming it).\n\nByakugan, Flawless Diagnosis, and similar effects can identify the corpse for what it is. Sharingan can tell that the 'person' seems to be using some sort of jutsu, possibly similar to Henge, but not identify the technique itself.\n\nYou can use these corpses to fight. On their own, they fight normally. In combat with you, you may spend AP to make them act, costing 1 AP per 2 Speed of the action you want them to take. They may not use chakra, though they may talk and perform other complex actions. When necessary, you use your skill rolls in place of theirs. The corpse cannot heal or be healed. It begins at Fatigue 0; if it reaches Fatigue 3, your jutsu ends and the corpse becomes lifeless and unusable.\n\nLearning this technique results in a one-time gain of +15 Infamy.</text>\n\\page\n# Sealing Ninjutsu\n## D-rank\n### --( Kankin Kanshihon Fuuin - Confinement Scroll Seal )--\nThis technique requires a blank scroll and something to write with. A series of symbols are written on the scroll, various items are placed on top of it, and the user performs the proper handseals. The items will vanished, stored inside the seal until they're released. This can be done repeatedly, with each item corresponding to a separate symbol on the scroll. Items can be sealed and released all at once, or one at a time.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nThis stores up to 50 pounds of objects inside a scroll. Releasing any number items is a Chakra 5, Speed 5 actions, which can be done by anyone who knows this technique. If used to release a weapon, it takes a separate action to 'draw' (grab and properly grasp) that weapon.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Soshoryu - Twin Rising Dragons )--\nThis requires two storage scrolls with projectile weapons stored inside of them. When this technique is used both the scrolls are launched into the air (giving the technique its name). The user can then jump up between them, grabbing and throwing various projectiles.\n\n  -  Stamina: Variable.\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Range: As weapons used.\n  -  Speed: Variable\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n  -  Requires: Two scrolls with thrown weapons sealed inside them.\n\nEffects:\nYou unseal and throw weapons. This is a regular multi-throw, but you add CHA/4 to your DEX when determining how many weapons you can throw. Notably, this can't be done with Senbon.\n\nWhile Soshoryu itself is (obviously) a ninjutsu technique, the multi-throw attack you perform as part of it is a ranged taijutsu attack.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Sougu: Baku Ryuusei - Manipulated Tools: Attached Meteor )--\nLarge, elongated sections of chains with weighted ends shoot out of a scroll and are directed toward an opponent.  They spiral around and surround the victim before the slack is removed, binding the opponent and restricting movement.  It does minimal damage on its own, but is useful as a setup for a more potent attack.\n\n  -  Chakra: 16\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n  -  Range: 12\n\nEffects:\nYou make a Ranged Taijutsu Attack.  If you hit, this deals no damage but restrains the opponent, inflicting a -2 Immobilization penalty, increased by 1 per point your Accuracy exceeds their defensive roll, with a maximum of -7.  Partial defense does not apply.\n\nThe chains themselves are still attached to the scroll, and therefore sufficient movement on the part of the victim will reduce this penalty, lowering it by 1 per four yards moved.  Alternately, they can try to just wrestle free as a Speed 6 action, rolling 1d20+STR/5 against your 1d20+CHA/5+(the remaining immobilization penalty from Attached Meteor).</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### --( Shikoku Fuuin - Finger Engraving Seal )--\nConcentrating chakra into your fingertip, this allows you to 'write' on any surface you please. On solid objects, this will cause a slight depression on the surface and stain it black. On flesh, this will cause slight discomfort and leave a scar, which is initially ink-black and lightens over the next few weeks to regular scar tissue.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Speed: 1 per word\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: 20 Chakra Control\n\nEffects:\nYou can write on any surface. With chakra!\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuukoku Houin - Dark Sealing Method )--\nA once-specialized technique that's been adapted to see broader use, the Dark Sealing Method is used when a simple lock just isn't reliable enough. The user takes several paper tags, writes the appropriate seals on them in their own blood, and then applies them to the edge of the doorframe, lid, or other appropriate edge of what's being sealed. After that, the handseals are performed and chakra is applied.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nThe door or container the paper tags are placed upon cannot be opened so long as this seal is in place; no amount of physical force can overcome it. That said, it gives no special properties to what has been sealed; if you apply Fuukoku Houin to a rickety wooden door, most people would have minimal trouble breaking a hole in the center of that door.\n\nThe tags themselves are virtually indestructible until the technique ends.\n\nWhen you apply this seal, you may specify a certain time for it to end, such as &quot;two days from now&quot;. The seal will last until the designated time arrives, or it's removed by some method (such as the A-rank Five Elements Unseal). The person who placed this seal can simply peel the tags away from the sealed surface, destroying the seal in the process.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Sougu: Tensasai - Manipulated Tools: Heavenly Chain of Destruction )--\nAn advanced form of Twin Rising Dragons, the user throws a scroll into the air and leaps after it.  In midair the weapons inside the scroll are released and projected by the user's chakra, allowing them to guide far more weapons than they would be able to by hand.  It gets its name from the speed of its most proficient practitioners, who can propel their weapons so fast they appear as rays of light.\n\n  -  Chakra: Variable, Special\n  -  Speed: As multi-throw.\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: Soshoryu\n\nEffects:\nYou perform a multi-throw technique using weapons stored inside one or more scrolls. The Chakra cost is equal to whatever the Stamina cost would normally be. Your ninjutsu damage bonus is used in place of your physical damage bonus.\n\nYou may target any number of people within range, each with separate multi-throws. This has the same cost no matter how many people you target, but you must use the full number of weapons (if you &quot;throw&quot; 10 shurikens at 4 people, you'd need 40 shuriken total).\n\nLike Soshoryu, this may not be used with senbon; it may also not be used to perform called shots.\n\nAlternately, by doubling the number of weapons you can make this an Area 10 attack, in which case it hits everything indiscriminately; by quadrupling the number of weapons required you can make it Area 20 centered on yourself, with you at the center. In either of these cases, the severity of wounds inflicted is reduced by one (additional) rank.\n\nAs an example of how that works: If you have 80 DEX, you could throw 16 shuriken to hit everyone in Area 10, with the equivalent of an 8-shuriken multi-throw. The increase in damage bonus based on number of weapons thrown would be (8 * 0.5) = 4, not (16 * 0.5) = 8.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Netetsuki no Jutsu - Sleeping Moon Technique )--\nAn exceptionally useful technique, as it approaches the much-yearned-for concept of a &quot;smart&quot; seal; one that can be deactivated easily without requiring extensive time and effort to then replace it.\n\nThis is not actually a seal itself, but a large number of specific modifications which can be applied to almost any advanced sealing technique; less complicated sealing jutsu are too simple to incorporate these alterations.\n\n  -  Chakra: +15 + X * 3\n  -  Seal Speed: +10 + X * 5\n\nEffects:\nThis is used to supplement another sealing technique of rank C or higher. When you apply it, specify an activation condition and a deactivation condition.\n\nPossible triggers include:\n<br>  &gt; Someone passes within (up to 10) yards of it.\n<br>  &gt; There is nobody within (up to 10) yards of it.\n<br>  &gt; A certain word is said or noise is made.\n<br>  &gt; Someone touches the seal.\n<br>  &gt; A specific person touches the seal (see below).\n<BR>\n\nIf keyed to touch-activation or -deactivation by specific people, you can specify up to X people, where X is (Research ranks)/5, who the seal will recognize by chakra signature; all of those people must be present when you apply the seal.\n\nWhen the activation condition occurs, the seal is activated. When the deactivation condition occurs, the seal becomes dormant; none of its effects apply until it's reactivated, though it remains visible.\n\nRemoving the seal augmented by Sleeping Moon Technique also removes this portion of the seal. Alternately, the Sleeping Moon seal could be removed, leaving the original seal in place but uncontrollable.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Tsuiseki Fuuin - Tracking Seal )--\nA very useful seal, though one which suffers from a number of limitations. When applied to a person, the seal vanishes almost immediately, becoming invisible and virtually undetectable, even to shinobi capable of seeing chakra (such as the Hyuuga and Uchiha).  Afterwards, whoever applied the seal will be able to get a vague idea of the location of the sealed individual, allowing them to be tracked across any distance.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20, raised to 30 if it hits\n  -  Accuracy: -6\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nUsed as an attack, you are allowed an Espionage roll with a +5 bonus against the opponent's.  If you succeed, they think you struck a glancing blow with a close-range attack; if you fail, they realize you used some sort of jutsu on them, though not what its effect was.\n\nOnce applied, the seal is invisible and undetectable. It will only be discovered by a sealing expert who knows to look for it. These seals have been known to go undetected for years, as a result.\n\nYou may only have one Tracking Seal applied at a time (though one person can have multiple Tracking Seals placed on them); if you use it on another person, your link to the other seal is broken, and that seal unravels harmlessly.\n\nBy forming a handseal and concentrating for several seconds you know the direction and approximate distance from your current location of the person you're tracking. This does not provide any bonuses in combat; while it lets you know your target is nearby, it lacks enough precision at such short distances to help you discover an opponent hidden in stealth. There is no limit on how often you may activate a Tracking Seal, though you have to stop and concentrate each time (and so cannot do it while moving).</text>\n## B-rank\n### --( Fuuka Houin - Fire Sealing Method )--\nThis technique allows a ninja to seal fire into a scroll. The proper seals must be written on the scroll, followed by the correct handseals. Once the technique is complete the flames will vanish entirely and be sealed within the scroll; the kanji for &quot;seal&quot; will appear on said scroll.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Range: 60\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nThis seals a fire inside of it. Up to (CHA/5) square yards of fire can by sealed this way (based on the area of whatever's fueling the flame). This works just as well with chakra-based flames as mundane ones.\n\nIf you complete the seals for this technique on the same Initiative Count that somebody finishes seals for a Katon jutsu, you may, as long as that technique involves actual flames, make an opposed Chakra Control roll against them, with a +10 bonus. If you meet or exceed the result of their roll, you seal their jutsu with this technique.\n\nYou can also use this technique to immediately end any Ignite effects on all people within the area affected.\n\nEach use of this technique requires a blank scroll for the fire to be sealed in. Once sealed, the flame is extinguished; it cannot be released, and the scroll cannot be reused.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Raikou Kenka - Lightning Blade Creation )--\nA special ninja tool summoning technique, this allows weapons or other ninja tools to be sealed with a single symbol in a scroll or, more commonly, clothes. Touching this symbol and willing it active is all it takes to summon these tools.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 45\n\nEffects:\nThis seals up to (CHA /5) items in a seal, which is applied to the target item.\n\nYou may summon weapons sealed with this technique as a Speed 0 action. In the case of melee weapons, this also replaces the regular action to draw the weapon. For thrown weapons, the first time you use this technique to unseal and then immediately attack with a thrown weapon it counts as a surprise attack.\n\nAny weapon or item in Equipment may be stored in these seals, though each seal may store only a single type of item (such as kunai, wakizashi, or smoke bombs).\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Keiyaku Fuuin - Contract Seal )--\nImplemented on a summoner, this removes any control the summoner has over their summoned creature, and in most cases will temporarily nullify the contract altogether.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nAny summoning contracts the victim possesses are considered null and void until this seal is removed. In most cases, this will forcibly de-summon anything they've already summoned. Defensive Summoning techniques used against this automatically fail.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Tsuyome Fuuin - Strengthening Seal )--\nAn advanced and demanding seal, this applies a resilient lattice of chakra to enhance the physical integrity of walls, floors, ceilings, and the like.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\nEffects:\nThis may be applied to any surface up to (CHA /10) square yards, and no thicker than (CHA /10) inches. You may divide the area by any whole number to multiply the thickness limitation by that much. For example, you could make it (CHA /10)/2 square yards, and in exchange apply the seal to a surface (CHA /10)*2 inches thick.\n\nThe seal is visible, though only on the side it's applied to (so if it's on the inside of a wall, you would not see it on the outside). Similarly, it can only be removed from that side. It may only be applied to a contiguous object: if you wanted to apply Strengthening Seal to a boat, each plank would require a separate seal.\n\nThe surface this seal is on is virtually indestructible. It gains (user's CHA)*10 HP, and has a damage reduction of (user's CHA), which cannot be bypassed or reduced.\n\nThis seal can only be applied to flat surfaces, such as walls. The blade of a weapon, just as an example, would not be a valid target.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shinsei Chinmoku Fuuin - Sacred Silence Seal )--\nOften used as a form of so-called 'loyalty seal', this has seen moderate popularity among various clandestine and/or extremist organizations within the ninja villages, as well as a means of helping ensure that double agents don't turn into triple agents.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Accuracy: -4\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 18\n\nEffects:\nWhen you apply this seal to a person, specify a topic. This may be as broad (&quot;anything involving Sand village&quot;) or as narrow (&quot;the new jutsu you saw me use&quot;) as you wish.\n\nThe victim may not attempt to communicate about that topic in any way, be it through speech, writing, or other methods. Intent is what matters here; if they think they're giving information about the subject, they are unable to.\n\nThe same restrictions apply regarding this seal itself. That said, it's not particularly inconspicuous. While the seal itself prevents the from showing it off, it takes the form of a hexagram somewhere on their torso, back, or tongue (in which case it can't be seen without the person actually sticking their tongue out and someone checking for it) and is easily identifiable by anyone with Seal Training.\n\nYou may, when applying this seal, also specify one exception to its restrictions. For example, you could say &quot;other Leaf nin&quot;--in which case the person with this seal could talk to other Leaf nin about the sealed topic, but nobody else.\n\nThis seal trumps any genjutsu short of the Poison Truth Technique.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Moji Hyouki no Jutsu - Rune Inscribing Technique )--\nA tricky seal, this allows the user to mold the chakra necessary for any ninjutsu technique they know and then 'freeze' it, holding it primed but inactive inside of a seal. Once a trigger condition occurs, the jutsu is released.\n\nUse of this technique to prepare explosive Katon techniques and leaving them around as a practical joke is strongly discouraged.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25 + X/2\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 30 + X\n\nEffects:\nWhen you use Moji Hyouki, select another ninjutsu which you are able to perform, specifying all its variable parameters at that time. You pay Moji Hyouki's cost, and then that jutsu's cost.\n\nMoji Hyouki can be placed on any reasonably flat, solid surface that's at least one foot across in each direction, such as a floor or a box.\n\nOnce applied, the seal will either vanish (making a potentially effective trap) or remain visible as an elaborate set of seals that can be identified by anyone familiar wit the technique (as a warning of sorts). Even if Moji Hyouki is identified, the technique  placed in it will not be.\n\nWhen the seal is placed, an activation condition is specified. The three possible activation conditions are:\n- Someone comes within five feet of the seal.\n- Someone touches the seal.\n- If the seal is on a door or container, it may be set to activate when said door or container is opened.\n\nWhen the seal activates, the jutsu in question will immediately take effect. If this is an offensive technique it will be aimed at the person who set it off (unless it's an AoE, in which case it will be centered on the seal). Offensive techniques used this way have a -2 Accuracy penalty per rank of the technique.\n\nThe A-rank Five Elements Unseal will not trigger a touch-activated Moji Hyouki.</text>\n\n## A-rank\n### --( Tensha Fuuin - Transcription Seal )--\nA rarely-seen technique, this seals the necessary chakra patterns for a specific jutsu inside a person, and keeps it perpetually ready within this seal. When a certain condition is met the seal activated and the technique is triggered.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 35\n\nEffects:\nWhen used, declare another technique which you know, pay its cost, and specify a condition. The technique immediately and involuntarily activates when that condition is met. \n\nPossible conditions include &quot;when you see the daimyo&quot; and &quot;when you hear the word 'orange' &quot;. A target can be specified within reason (such as &quot;the daimyo&quot;, or &quot;whoever said that word&quot;).\n\nThe technique stored inside a Transciption Seal may not be a taijutsu or medical ninjutsu technique, nor may it have a Stamina cost or Upkeep. If it is a Genjutsu or Sealing technique, it is applied to the person on who the Transcription Seal was placed. If it's anything else, the Seal's recipient must pay the associated cost or costs.\n\n\nA person may only have one Transcription Seal on them at a time, per person (three sealing experts could each place one Transcription Seal on a single person, for example).\n\nThis seal is invisible and undetectable except for by a fuuinjutsu expert who knows to look for it.\n______________________\n\n### --( Gogyou Fuuin - Five Elements Seal )--\nThis jutsu produces a powerful seal that disrupts the flow of chakra in the target. In most cases this is crippling.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Accuracy: -5\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 50\n\nEffects:\nThe unfortunate victim has a -25 penalty to all Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and has their Chakra Control skill ranks reduced by 15, which can also temporarily lower their ranks in abilities (such as Water Walking). Any jutsu with Upkeeps they have activated end immediately due to the disruption of their chakra.\n\nIf they fail a Chakra Exhaustion roll, they fail to use the jutsu they were trying to (but still advance a Fatigue category as normal). Furthermore, even if they succeed they must pass a Chakra Control check against the technique's Chakra cost or fail anyway.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Gogyou Kaiin - Five Elements Unseal )--\nThe opposite of the Five Elements Seal, but of much broader utility, this technique can remove any seal of equal or lesser strength.\n\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nThis can target a single seal on an object or person. That seal is removed.\n\nThis affects any seals described in this section. This technique may be able to remove seals not described in the PHB... or, it may not.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Fuuja Houin - Evil Sealing Method )--\nNot all seals can be removed easily. This circumvents that by suppressing fuuinjutsu, or any sort of chakra-based markings, on a person. The technique's greatest failing is its dependence upon the recipient to provide some of the strength behind it, meaning they can overcome its effects at will, making it useless for offensive applications.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nThis suppresses any seal in this section of the PHB, and many which are not. While the seal won't be removed, it won't activate or have any of its normal effects as long as the Evil Sealing Method remains in place.\n\nThis technique is dependent upon the recipient's willpower. All a person has to do is focus and the Evil Sealing Method will be disabled, until they spend 1 Willpower to reactivate it.\n\nThe technique's quite useful. Virtually any long-term chakra-based effect (even ones that aren't actually fuuinjutsu) can be suppressed by it. Even the effects and abilities of bloodlines can be sealed.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Tsute Fuuin - Influence Seal )--\nThis seal was originally created and placed upon servants of the Diamyo, ensuring those closest to them could not spy or sabotage the feudal lords. Over time, shinobi adapted to suit their own needs, which naturally meant that it found a usage in combat.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 14, +10 if it hits\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nYou use your Accuracy for an unarmed Taijutsu attack, and if you hit, you roll opposed Espionage (Partial Defense does not apply). If you succeed in your Espionage roll, the seal is placed without the target knowing.\n\nAs part of this technique, you may either make a basic unarmed taijutsu attack or use the E-rank Grab technique (if you know it), at no additional Speed or Stamina cost.\n\n\nThe seal is inactive by default, but as a Speed 10, Chakra 10 + X action, you can create a temporary form of paralysis which turns their own Chakra against them, preventing them from taking any non-Interrupt actions. They declare their intended action along with its Accuracy and Speed, but roll a Chakra X*2. If they fail, they are not fatigued and do not roll the Chakra or Stamina rolls associated with their action. Their IC is not advanced by the action's Speed, but they suffer a Stun 5 which cannot be reduced or negated.\n\nWhen applying this seal, &quot;X&quot; has a maximum value of your current bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls, including Fatigue bonuses but ignoring any non-Upkeep penalties.\n\n\nEvery time that a victim has previously had to roll against this seal's effects, they gain a +3 to their Chakra Exhaustion roll to overcome its effects. After they've succeeded against even one of these rolls, the seal is forced into remission, and will not affect them any more; it cannot be reapplied or reactivated for the rest of that fight.\n\nOnce the seal is subdued, it is, as far as the victim can tell, gone entirely, its effects having been broken. However, after 24 hours have passed the seal can be reactivated by its user, per the normal rules. An expert in sealing jutsu will be able to, if they know someone has had this seal applied to them, find and remove it using the A-rank Five Elements Unseal technique.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Ketsumei no Tsurugi - Sword of Blood Oath )--\nThis seal creates what is essentially a modified version of the blood pacts many shinobi form with summoned creatures. Rather than a powerful and intelligent animal, however, this 'contract' is made with a favored weapon.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\nEffects:\nYou can seal a single weapon with this technique. The weapon vanishes, and the seal for this technique manifests somewhere of your choosing on your body--usually the user's forearms.\n\nYou can summon the sealed weapon as a Speed 0 action, already 'drawn'. As a Speed 4 action, you may return it to the seal, in which case it vanishes in a puff of smoke; you must actually have the weapon with you to do this.\n\nIf the weapon is broken, or taken more than a mile away from you, it vanishes in a puff of smoke. In this case it will not be available for summoning for one hour. However, it is, for most intents and purposes, indestructible and impossible to lose in any permanent sense.\n\nYou may only have one Sword of Blood Oath seal active on you at a time. Removing your current seal causes the weapon to appear beside you, and allows you to make a new one.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Nenshou Fuuin - Burning Seal )--\nA highly-specialized, highly-effective sealing technique used to prevent an individual from handling weapons. Though it's applied as a single seal, it appears on both the recipient's (or rather, victim's) hands, clearly recognizable as some form of ninja sealing technique or tattoo meant to emulate one. Whenever the recipient holds a weapon the seals activate.\n\nAs the lines of the seal begin glowing a dark, heated red, the victim's skin will start to burn and smolder. Within seconds their flesh will start to smoke as they're baked alive; if one is willful or self-destructive enough to not drop the weapon they're holding, they'll soon have their arms reduced into charred, blackened husks.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Accuracy: -5\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\nThe seal activates whenever someone holds a weapon. After 5 IC, a Minor Energy Wound is inflicted to whichever arm they were holding the weapon with; in the case of a two-handed weapon, this is both arms. Dropping the weapon will end this technique's effects immediately.\n\nIf they're currently suffering from a wound inflicted by the Burning Seal, it instead inflicts a wound of one higher category on that arm: Major, then Severe, then finally Critical.\n\nFor example, if a shinobi drew a nodachi and decided to use it one-handed (holding it in their right hand) starting on IC 12, on IC 17 they would suffer a Minor Energy wound to their right arm. If they then began two-handing it, on IC 22 they would have a Minor on their left arm and a Major (in addition to the existing Minor) on their right. On IC 27 those would be Major and Severe; on IC 32, they would become Severe and Critical; and finally, by IC 37 they would have a Critical Energy wound on both arms. </text>\n\\page\n# Genjutsu\n\n1. Requirements\n2. Special Rules\n\n====================\n1. Requirements\n------------------------------\n\nGenjutsu's not easy. In fact, genjutsu is really, really hard, even by the standards of other ninja techniques. Taijutsu and ninjutsu are both, after enough shinobi training, slightly intuitive; and, in the case of the latter, every ninja has an elemental affinity they can rely on to help them out even when they struggle overall.\n\nNot so with genjutsu. There is no such thing as an 'affinity' for it (though some ninja who seem to have an easier time learning it are occasionally described as such), and it takes a lot work to be able to use it effectively.\n\nThe requirements for using Genjutsu of a given rank are listed below.\n\n<br>E: Genjutsu Training ability\n<br>D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Research, and 15 (Chakra Control + Research)\n<br>C: 10 Chakra Control, 10 Research, and 25 (Chakra Control + Research)\n<br>B: 20 Chakra Control, 20 Research, and 50 (Chakra Control + Research)\n<br>A: 30 Chakra Control, 30 Research, and 70 (Chakra Control + Research)\n\nNotably, Jounin rank also gives access to C-rank Genjutsu.\n\n\n====================\n2. Special Rules\n------------------------------\n\nGenjutsu relies upon confusing the senses, which is a powerful tool in the arsenal of someone who relies on subterfuge... or even just a shinobi needing an extra edge in combat.\n\nIt's quite possible to realize one's under a genjutsu, but that doesn't give any special ability to overcome its effects (&quot;disbelieving the illusion&quot;, so to speak, doesn't actually work). On the other hand, it's hard to fool someone again and again with the same trick; each time a genjutsu is successfully used against you in combat, you have a (cumulative) +5 bonus to defensive rolls against that specific jutsu for the rest of the battle.\n\nThere are three ways to break free from most genjutsu:\n &gt; Genjutsu Kai, the D-rank Ninjutsu technique.\n &gt; If you suffer a Wound of any severity, all Genjutsu effects applied you end as your mind gets its act back together. \n &gt; Many Genjutsu will have upkeeps, durations, or the like. Details will exist in specific jutsu entries.\n\nBy their nature, it's hard to realize that one is suffering from the effects of a genjutsu technique. It's possible to be afflicted by a genjutsu that you know and use frequently, with obvious 'tells', and still mistake it for reality--such is the nature of delusions. Mechanically, this means that if you fail a genjutsu roll by 5 points or fewer, you realize that you've been afflicted by an illusionary technique; any higher, and you have no reason to suspect that what you're experiencing is anything but reality.</text>\n\n## E-rank\n### --( Senpuku no Jutsu - Concealment Technique )--\nThis jutsu allows a ninja to conceal small (or sometimes not-so-small) items on their person or in their grasp. This is a fantastic technique for smuggling items or transporting them in secrecy, its utility counteracted only by its vulnerabilities.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Upkeep: 2\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThis completely hides an object from casual observation. Against a detailed search, it gives a +5 bonus to any rolls to keep it hidden, and allows the obect to, essentially, hide in plain sight. You have to keep contact with the object, or at least keep it close to you (say, in a belt holster).\n\nIt won't hide it if you're being patted down. If the object interacts with the rest of the world (such as taking a swinging with a weapon, or using a key to open a door) the concealment ends.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Genkoe - Hallucinatory Voices )--\nDespite its name, this technique isn't limited to voices, or even auditory hallucinations. It has no effect at all until the victim begins paying a bit too much attention to their surroundings, at which point the technique begins playing tricks on their senses, causing them to see movement at the corner of their vision and gentle sounds just slightly too vague to place.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Upkeep: 2\n  -  Speed: 7\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nThis technique inflicts a -2 penalty to Awareness rolls. It also halves the bonus for consecutive actions spent searching (so if you Searched three consecutive times with Genkoe applied to you, you'd have a +3, rather than +6, bonus on your next roll).\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Mousou Enmu no Jutsu - Illusory Mist Technique )--\nMasquerading as a higher-ranked Suiton technique, this creates a light bank of fog which has little effect beyond making the atmosphere a bit chillier. An illusion is then laid on all those present (the user may exclude allies if they wish), tricking them into believing the mist is actually thick enough to be a hindrance.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Range: Centered on self\n  -  Area: 25\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 7\n\nEffects:\nAnyone who fails a genjutsu roll is placed a -4 visibility penalty. More insidiously, so long as they remain within the mist they have a -2 penalty to all their defensive genjutsu rolls.\n\nPeople who pass their genjutsu roll still see the mist, but for what it really is: too thin and wispy to actually be an impediment.</text>\n\n## D-rank\n### --( Kasumi Juusha no Jutsu - Mist Servant Technique )--\nThis jutsu creates clones that phase in and out of the ground as if they were made of a blackish, oil-like liquid. When attacked, the clones regenerate themselves. The clones can be controlled to make it seem as if they're attacking. The user can then time their attacks with those of the clones to remain concealed.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nThis genjutsu creates dozens of illusions of the user. Anyone in combat with them must 'defend' against this technique with a genjutsu roll. The clones are harmless, and slow-moving, but may feign attacks intermittently.\n\nWhen this is used, you are automatically placed in Stealth (as one of the clones). You may attack from stealth normally, but in addition to ranged attacks, you may make any basic weapon or unarmed attack without breaking stealth. Each attack lowers your Stealth TN by 3, rather than 5. If you take a Hide or Improve Hiding action, this technique's benefits end.\n\nOnce you've been found, you cannot hide among these clones again; you'd need to use the technique once more to do that. This is a clone technique.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Oboro Bunshin no Jutsu - Haze Clone Technique )--\nThis creates what appear to be ordinary bunshin, even responding and vanishing when struck. However, each time one clone is destroyed another takes its place, typically just out of sight of whoever destroyed its predecessor.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10, +2 per clone\n  -  Upkeep: 0\n  -  Speed: 8, +1 per clone\n  -  Seal Speed: 4, +2 per clone\n\nEffects:\nYou may create up to three clones. This function as normal clones, but you are always 'hidden' among your clones (as per the 'Hide Among Clones' action), even after you've been hit by an opponent.\n\nTaking an Observe action allows an opponent to make a genjutsu roll to realize that this is an illusion, but cannot actually single you out from your clones. Any time a clone used in this technique is destroyed, another one appears to take its place and the Upkeep is increased by 1.\n\nNo initial genjutsu roll is made; opponents are, by default, tricked into believing these are normal clones. However, after the first time they realize this technique for what it is (i.e. an illusion) in batle, they'll also recognize all future uses of it in that same battle as such.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique)--\nThe user creates an illusion of spinning leaves around the victim, after the leaves disappear, the illusion begins, showing the victim something they'd rather never see, be it a loved one hurt, a monster of their nightmares, or some other such thing. In most cases, it is easy to identify that the image is fake, due to the unlikliness of it occuring, but some images still leave a foul sensation in ones mind.\n\n  -  Chakra: 16\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Special: Stun 20\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nWhatever image this subjects the victim to, the end result is they lose a point of Willpower. After the first time in a day this is (successfully) used on someone, the 'horror' begins to lose impact, reducing its effects to Stun 10 and no Willpower loss. If this genjutsu is broken (by the target being wounded, or somebody else using Kai on them) the Stun will end prematurely, but the lost Willpower will not be regained.\n\nIf used on a target with 0 Willpower remaining, this technique's Stun is doubled (to 40, or 20, depending on whether or not it's been used on them previously in that battle).\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Magen: Jigoku Kouka no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Descending Hell Technique)--\nThis illusion causes any afflicted by it to see a massive fireball forming above them which slowly descends. Most prudent shinobi will waste time trying to escape its radius, while those who are more reckless will take the 'attack' head-on, bracing themselves against a blow that never actually comes.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Area: 15\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nIf someone was affected by the genjutsu, they have until 25 IC have passed to leave this technique's area. If they don't, they suffer a Stun 15. This genjutsu ended before the time is up will prevent the stun; once they are stunned, the illusion is already over and so cannot be 'broken' to end the stun prematurely.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shinkirou no Jutsu - Mirage Technique )--\nThis creates an illusion that can fool a person's sight, hearing, or smell--or, with more effort, two of those, or all three. These can be dynamic (such as a flickering fire or a fluttering curtain), but they can't actually interact with anything.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Upkeep: 3\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Area: 2 (max)\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nBy default, this creates an illusion that only applies to one sense; examples would be an illusion of a curtain flapping in a breeze, or the sound of footsteps.\n\nBy raising the chakra cost by 5, the illusion can apply to two senses, such as a tiger that crouches and snarls. Raising the chakra cost by 10 (to a total of 20) allows the illusion to be convincing to all three, such as a fire that flickers, crackles, and smells like burning wood.\n\nThis technique's primary limitation is its scale. It can't do anything much larger than a large piece of furniture or more complicated than one person. Anyone who interacts with this is allowed an Awareness roll against your Chakra Control to realize it's a fake, with your roll receiving a +5 bonus.\n\nSome things can make this obviously fake, such as touching it or standing at the 'source' of the noise and realizing there's nothing there. You can control this illusion if you're in range; if not, you can set it to be essentially a looping recording.</text>\n\n## C-rank\n### --( Nemuri - Sleep )--\nA genjutsu whose greatest limitation is that it requires physical contact, the user places their hand on a target and sends them immediately into a deep slumber. Very nice for infiltration without raising a fuss.\n\n  -  Chakra: 18\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Special: No handseals required.\n\nEffects:\nThis can't be used in combat. If you're able to touch the target and succeed with a genjutsu roll, they immediately fall asleep (it's a good idea to ease them to the ground, to avoid them, say, bashing their shoulder on a rock and immediately waking themselves back up).\n\nUnless they're woken up (see the Sleep status for details), they'll be asleep for at least four hours.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kyousanken no Jutsu - Iron Curtain Technique )--\nThe user places themself under a harmless genjutsu, which itself serves no purpose but makes it more difficult for other genjutsu to affect you normally.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nSo long as this technique's upkeep is maintained, you have a +4 bonus to defensive genjutsu rolls. This genjutsu does not end when you're wounded.\n\nYou may declare Iron Curtain as an Interrupt when targeted with genjutsu, following the normal rules for defensive interrupts and giving you its bonus for that defensive genjutsu roll. Iron Curtain does remain active (as if activated normally) after being used this way.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Kori Shinchuu no Jutsu - Sly Mind Affect Technique )--\nThis technique warps an opponent's senses and sets them walking in circles, potentially for hours on end, by making it seem to them as if they're walking straight towards their desired destination. Maps, compasses, and paths will all be ineffective--the best someone suffering from this technique can do is hold the hand of someone who's not, or hope they realize that they've passed the same landmark ten times.\n\n  -  Chakra: 18\n  -  Range: 40\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nEffects:\nThis technique has no effect in combat, and does not end when the victim is wounded. You may target multiple people with this technique, costing 1 Willpower per additional person who is affected (this extra cost isn't paid if they defend against it).\n\nSomeone affected by this technique will find themselves continually walking in circles if they try to travel any appreciable distance (half a mile or more). This lasts for 1 hour per point you beat their genjutsu roll by. Every hour, they're allowed a new genjutsu roll against your original result, to see if they notice the effects (although this will not break the technique on its own).\n\nNot even something like following a road will work--they'll wind up wandering off it, the illusion convincing them they're still on the &quot;road.&quot;\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Magen: Kokoni Arazu no Jutsu - Demon Illusion: False Surroundings Technique )--\nThis jutsu allows the user to change the surroundings around a person subtley, usually used to delay, or force people to walk in circles, unaware that they have stopped going the right way, even messing with ones ability to track the direction they are headed, such as north from south.\n\n  -  Chakra: 17\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Area: 30\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nBest used out of combat (anyone who sees this being used will realize it's an illusion), this casts an illusion over an area. This could be making a door appear to be a solid wall, a sign have the wrong number on it, or an intact bridge appear to be broken.\n\nWhen used, make a genjutsu roll with a +5 bonus. Anyone who encounters your illusion makes a genjutsu roll; failure means they believe it's real, success means they know it's an illusion. Actually getting rid of it requires the use of Genjustu Kai, though the illusion won't affect senses other than sight.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Shunou Kaimetsu - Brain Destruction )--\nThis jutsu convinces the victim that they've been grievously injured. Although it causes no actual physical harm, it convinces their mind and all their senses that they've suffered some manner of severe damage.\n\n  -  Chakra: 26\n  -  Range: 30\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nThis inflicts a temporary wound on the victim. It's by default Minor, raised to Major if you beat their genjutsu roll by 5 or more, and Severe if you beat their roll by 10 or more. They interpret this technique as whatever sort of attack or jutsu would be appropriate to cause the injury they believe they're suffering from.\n\nThey suffer all normal effects of this injury (and good luck trying to convince them it's all in their head), aside from HP loss or unconsciousness. It lasts until the genjutsu is broken. You choose the damage type and wound location.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Sen'un no Jutsu - Fog of War Technique )--\nYou trap a target in some manner of in-depth hallucination. They may believe that you've run away and think they're giving pursuit, or be convinced that they're locked in combat with you. This technique is often a last-ditch resort to escape from a superior adversary, or bypass someone when there's no time to deal with them in direct combat.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25 + X * 3\n  -  Range: 50\n  -  Upkeep: 15\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nUsing this technique costs 2 Willpower if it succeeds. It has a +X bonus to your Genjutsu roll, up to a maximum of +5. If used successfully, whoever its victim was is left trapped in some manner of hallucination. \n\nThe target is essentially removed from combat for this technique's duration. Unfortunately, this technique is particularly fragile. If the target senses danger (such as from an incoming jutsu, or planting explosives around them) it'll break in time for them to try to avoid it. It lasts for a maximum of 5 minutes per 1 point you beat their genjutsu roll by.</text>\n\\page\n## B-rank\n### --( Nemurihane - Sleep Feather )--\nAn advanced version of Nemuri, this causes the subject to briefly see illusory feathers drifting down around them before they succumb to sleep. It's no more useful in combat, but it can actually be used at a range, or from hiding.\n\n  -  Chakra: 24\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nThis functions as the C-rank Nemuri, but may be used at up to the listed range.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Magen: Nijuu Kokoni Arazu no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Double False Surroundings Technique )--\nAn advanced technique, this constructs one illusion on top of another. When the outer layer is destroyed, the second will flawlessly take its place and masquerade as reality. Confident that they've overcome the deception, most shinobi will have an even harder time realizing that they haven't done so at all.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Upkeep: 8 (4 after the first layer is removed)\n  -  Area: 30\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 18\n  -  Requires: False Surroundings Technique\n\nEffects:\nAs the regular False Surroundings technique, but removing the second illusion requires a second application of Genjutsu Kai, and your genjutsu roll with it has a +10 bonus.\n\nThis may also be used with Sly Mind Affect, by increasing this technique's cost by 6 and removing its Upkeep, in which case the second 'layer' of the technique has no bonus, but must still be 'discovered' after hours of wandering, as per the normal Sly Mind Affect genjutsu. Used this way, it becomes a targeted (rather than Area) technique), using Sly Mind Affect's normal range.\n\n______________________\n\n\n### --( Magen: Jubaku Satsu - Demon Illusion: Tree Binding Death )--\nThis genjutsu makes its unfortunate victim believe that a large tree has suddenly grown behind them through the use of some manner of ninjutsu, and pinned them against its trunk by exceptionally-strong, chakra-animated branches.\n\n  -  Chakra: 34\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Special: Immobilize 10\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 22\n\nEffects:\nEvery 20 IC which pass, the victim is allowed another genjutsu defensive against your original roll, at a cumulative +1 penalty, to realize that this is only an illusion. Effects which allow someone to reduce immobilization penalties do not apply against this technique.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Jigyaku no Jutsu - Time Reversal Technique)--\nUsed on willing recipitants, this jutsu puts the target in a trance like state, and keeps them hypnotized, to uncover forgotten memories or past events. Its often used to uncover important details that have been missed or forgotten on missions, or to help shinobi make 100% accurate reports on the most important of missions, rarely on unimportant missions.\n\n  -  Chakra: 28\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nThis can only be used on helpless or willing recipients. It places the subject into a trance-like state, similar to hypnosis. It causes them to recall any suppressed memories, and can help remember details they might otherwise have forgotten.\n\nMechanically, this will unravel the effects of the A-rank Sennou Sousa no Jutsu, and gives a +5 bonus to Research rolls made to remember details about a previous experience (such as glancing around a room and needing to recall its contents). It will also uncover any memories suppressed due to trauma or similar causes.\n\nThis can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on what it's being used for, how deeply buried the hidden memories are, and how much information needs to be remembered. This technique may only be used on a given person once per day.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Gosaru Tatari - Five Monkey Curse )--\nThis technique interferes with the victim's ability to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel pain. Admittedly, the last one's an undesirable addition to the mix (in most circumstances), butthe technique makes up for that with its all-around usefulness.\n\n  -  Chakra: 28\n  -  Range: 30\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nThis negates all ranks the victim has in Enhanced Hearing and Enhanced Sight, and any abilities dependant upon them (such as Blind Fighting or Genjutsu Awareness). They also suffer a -2 visibility penalty (which stacks with any other visibility penalties they may have). On the other hand, their reduced sensory perception allows them to ignore the penalties of any Minor wounds they may be suffering from.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Magen: Tetsuotome no Jutsu - Demonic Illusion: Iron Maiden Technique )--\nChains burst from the ground beneath the victim and wrap around their legs, anchoring them in place, followed by two halves of an iron maiden, either on each side of the victim or in front of and behind them. The iron maiden slams shut with them in it, causing excruciating pain and a slew of debilitating injuries.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Range: 30\n  -  Special: Stun 12\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 18\n\nEffects:\nThis temporarily inflicts a Minor Piercing wound on every location of the opponent's body (torso, abdomen, both arms, both legs, and Slashing on the head). If the genjutsu roll beats their defense by 10 points or more, this is upgraded to a Major Piercing wound on every location. These wounds last for the duration of the illusion, though the full Stun will remain even if it's broken early.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Sakki - Killing Intent )--\nA side-effect of learning how to control chakra is the ability to sense, and exude, what shinobi refer to as killing intent. More powerful shinobi can project it more strongly, and even send lesser ninja running with just a glance.\n\nThis genjutsu simulates an intense blast of paralyzingly strong killing intent in an attempt to overwhelm its target.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Range: 15\n  -  Special: Stun 10 + X\n  -  Speed: 16\n\nEffects:\nYou and your target must have line of sight with one another (and neither can be suffering from a visibility penalty of -6 or greater). X is the amount the victim failed their Genjutsu dodge roll by, and until the stun has ended they suffer from Paralysis X/3. The stun is cut short if the jutsu ends early.\n\nThis technique doesn't require handseals.</text>\n## A-rank\n### --( Nehan Shouja no Jutsu - Temple of Nirvana Technique )--\nThe most powerful version of Nemuri, used for putting a large group of people to sleep. Anybody within fifty meters of the user who fails their Genjutsu dodge is put into a deep sleep. Nothing short of extremely loud noises, being shaken awake, several hours passing, or similar situations will wake them up, allowing victims to be bound, moved, or completely ignored. This move is again, useless in combat.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Range: 150\n  -  Area: 50 \n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nAnyone in the area who fails a genjutsu dodge falls asleep. Anyone with less than half the user's total XP automatically fails their genjutsu dodge unless they spend a point of Willpower to be allowed to actually roll it (that roll does not gain the normal effects of benefitting from Willpower being spent on it, unless they spend another point).\n\nAnd, once again, it's no good on targets who are engaged in combat. Like Nemuri, victims will be asleep for several hours unless awoken.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kokuangyo no Jutsu -  Bringer-of-Darkness Technique )--\nThis technique specifically targets the victim's eyesight, effectively blinding them and allowing its user to attack with impunity.\n\n  -  Chakra: 36\n  -  Range: 50\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 26\n\nEffects:\nThis applies a -10 visibility penalty to the victim. While it's in effect, anyone can attempt to hide from them (even if the victim can somehow reduce that penalty below -6).\n\nThis technique does not automatically end when the victim is wounded. Instead, it requires a successful use of Genjutsu Kai (with a -10 penalty) or a Major or greater wound to be inflicted upon the technique's user.\n\nWhile in effect, this technique essentially negates any doujutsu the victim may possess.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Kiokure Keiren - Nervous Convulsions )--\nThis technique partially hijacks the victim's nervous system, reacting in response to anything they do and sending conflicting signals. It's only truly effective in combat, where physical activity is the most spontaneous, and even slightly reduced reaction time can prove fatal. This tends to be exceptionally painful.\n\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Range: 40\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 27\n\nEffects:\nWhenever you take an action while under this technique's effects, X is that action's Speed. You suffer from a Paralyze (X)/4, which lasts for (X)*2 IC, applied after your action is resolved.\n\nEvery time this effect is activated, you roll another genjutsu defense against the original result. Once you succeed, and are free from the genjutsu, new Paralyze statuses stop triggering, but any existing ones will remain for their full duration.\n\\page\n______________________\n\n### --( Sennou Sousa no Jutsu - Memory-Concealing Manipulative Sand Technique )--\nThis technique allows the user to alter or conceal the subject's memories. While it's not permanent, the change can by either subtle (believing they were incapacitated and left unconscious, rather than incapacitated and then interrogated), or about as much so as a sledgehammer (erasing the past two days of their memory).\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nThis may only be used on a helpless or willing subject.\n\nOn a willing recipient, the technique is incredibly potent. It can suppress virtually any amount of a person's memories, and can even be used to alter existing memories or create wholly fabricated ones. One popular way of using the technique is to implant false memories of a person choosing to defect (and suppressing ones of them coming up with this plan) and then using them as a double-agent, working alongside and gathering intel from the enemy until the technique is undone at the right moment for them to change back to their original allegiance. Indeed, this jutsu is one of the more pragmatic reasons for most villages not trusting missing nin defectors.\n\nOn a helpless and unwilling target, the jutsu's efficacy is greatly reduced. An opposed genjutsu roll is made, and &quot;X&quot; is determined as the amount this technique's user succeeded by. Up to X hours worth of memories, in the past X days, can be erased. The greatest limitation is the user's knowledge. &quot;Your meeting with the daimyo&quot; could be targeted for erasure, but there's no way of knowing if the target also received secret orders after that meeting. &quot;Finding us here&quot;, and &quot;the past few hours&quot; are reasonably common uses.\n\nNo matter how extreme this technique is, it can't alter one's subconscious. You cannot forget abilities, jutsu, or your name. You might forget a person you met, but they'd always be slightly familiar.\n\nAlthough a person could be afflicted with multiple instances of this genjutsu, it can only be applied once per week. Genjutsu kai will not remove this technique, nor will being wounded. When you apply this technique, make a genjutsu roll. Anyone other than you attempting to unravel it (such as with the B-rank Jigyaku no Jutsu) has to roll at least that high when they attempt to do so, or they won't even notice this technique's presence.\n\n______________________\n\n### --( Dokushin no Jutsu - Poison Truth Technique )--\nThis technique traps the victim in a state of dream-like hallucination. In that state, the technique's user can try to pry information from them, in the form of questions, which the subject will then (coherently, and audibly) mumble the answer to.\n\nUnlike torture, this technique leaves no physical marks, and the victims will not remember what information they revealed or managed to kept secret. It often takes longer than torture to extract usable information, but it's much more reliable because the subject can't lie.\n\nMultiple, especially consecutive, uses of this technique can leave a victim traumatized without knowing why--indeed, even the users aren't entirely sure what kind of hallucinations the victim experiences. While it's not quite a forbidden technique, using it is considered extremely morally ambiguous.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 50\n\nEffects:\nThis technique may only be used on a helpless victim, and when used immediately puts them to sleep. The genjutsu user must then focus for the victim's maximum Willpower in hours.\n\nThe interrogator asks a question up to twelve words long, and an opposed genjutsu roll is made.\n\nIf the interrogator succeeds, the subject must answer the question truthfully and without obfuscation. (To the question, 'Where is the scroll?', &quot;In the castle&quot; would not be a legitimate answer, but &quot;In my room in the castle&quot; would). The subject only has to answer the question asked, not the question intended.\n\nIf the interrogator fails, the subject does not have to answer that question. Alternately, they may spend a point of Willpower and automatically succeed against a given question.\n\nEach time a question is asked, the subject gets a +2 bonus on future genjutsu rolls against this technique, unless they spent a point of Willpower to automatically avoid answering. So long as this bonus lasts, the following questions cannot be asked:\n &gt; Any question that they've previously been asked during that session.\n &gt; A rewording of a previous question (&quot;Who was that person?&quot; instead of &quot;Who was that man?&quot;, for example)\n\nIf the victim does not know the answer to a question, that question is simply wasted. The cumulative bonus to defend against this technique lasts for the victim's maximum Willpower in days. A person won't begin to regain Willpower (spent defending against this technique, or for any other reason) until at least 24 hours have passed without Dokushin no Jutsu being used upon them.</text>\n\n\n\\page\n### Konohagakure no Sato\n<img \n  src='https://justdaydreaming.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/naruto-fire-country-hidden-leaf-village-01.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n\n\nLocated in the middle of Fire Country. Konoha experiences the full gamut of desirable weather - that is to say, it's usually sunny, and even the rainy days can be pleasant. The village is roughly one third smaller than it was before the war, but strolling down the streets of Konoha you might never realize unless someone told you. \n<BR>\nKonoha does not appear to have been damaged by the war at all. The unwavering Will of Fire blazed in the hearts of the survivors and they set about rebuilding and landscaping the damaged parts of the village almost immediately. Narrow brick pathways sprawl from the outer edges of the village, shaded by decades old oak trees, leading to small housing communities tucked neatly into the forest. The village is more a part of the forest now than it had ever been in the past. Many buildings in downtown Konoha received new facades or were rebuilt completely. Beyond this, the village isn't looking to waste resources on overextending its boundaries. They make room for new citizens as it's required. In the mean time, all the spaces reserved for future expansion are filled with neatly kept parks and forested areas. \n\n<Br>\n\nThe forces of konoha have the clans of Aburame, Akimichi, Inuzuka, Hyuuga, Nara, Senju, Uchiha, and the Yamanaka to call upon. \n```\n```\nAfter the Fourth Great Shinobi war, Konoha was no longer the most densely populated village. They had the largest population of civilians and shinobi before the war - and in honor of all those lost they built a second monument in the east. As tradition in Konoha goes, they'll never forget those who gave their lives for their village, but they won't let the past keep them from building the brightest future they can. Even a century after the war, the Will of Fire burns more brightly now than it had ever in the past. \n<Br>\n\nUnfortunately all of this good will does not pay the bills. Because Konoha had the most to lose, it lost the most. They're steadily rebuilding, and each generation of shinobi seems more bright and promising than the last\n<Br>\n<Br>\n\n\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Ysh4.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\nThe Forehead Protector of Konoha, wore by its active shinobi with pride!\n\n\\page\n\n## Aburame\nThe Aburame are one of four noble clans of Konoagakure, a quiet clan whose members usually keep to themselves.  They are fairly distinct in the way they dress themselves, usually covering the majority of their body with their clothing, with dark glasses that hide their eyes.  They are soft-spoken, often preferring only to speak when they have something worthwhile to say.\n<Br>\n\n\nTheir solitude may have to do with the way their clan's techniques, as every clan member at a young age becomes host to a hive of insects called Kikaichuu, a special type of beetle-like bug which can actually eat the chakra of their enemies in battle.  Their bodies become the nest of the bugs, and over time they form a symbiotic relationship that allows the Aburame to mentally control and direct them.  While a powerful kekkai genkai, it is not an ability that interests most people.\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n##### --( Kikaichuu no Jutsu - Parasitic Destruction Insect Technique )--\nA technique exclusive to the Aburame, wherein they allow their bodies to be used as a hive for the insect.\n\n   Base Cost: 0\n   Scale: 5\n   Limit: 4+EXP/400\n\nEffects:  You gain a Swarm that starts out at Swarm Size 1 the first time this is taken, and gains 1 Swarm Size every rank thereafter.  Every even rank of this ability (2, 4, etc), you gain one Female Kikai. This swarm is inside your body and must be deployed (See Kikaichuu node) to be used. In clan techniques, the X is the amount of your swarm deployed. (If you have A Size 10 Swarm, you could deploy 4 of it and gain bonuses for only 4, while keeping the remainder safe inside your body.)\n\n______________________\n\n##### --( Hijutsu: Mushiyose - Secret Technique: Insect Bite )--\n\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: X*2\n  -  Damage: Xd20\n  -  Range: X\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Area: X/2\n\nThis technique has an accuracy bonus of X/3, and if you hit, the target takes a penalty to Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to the number of Female Kikai in the Swarm, which is cumulative, but does go away when they advance a Fatigue level, or do anything else that clears CE penalties.\n\n______________________\n\n```\n```\n<img \n  src='http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/5/5e/Shino%27s_Insect_Clone.png/revision/latest?cb=20150301041546' \n  style='width:325px' />\n##### --( Hijutsu: Mushiyose - Secret Technique: Insect Search )--\n\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Range: CHA*5\n\n\n\nYou can actually send them further than the range of the technique, but you can no longer communicate with them and can only send them to places you know, and can only give them a single, basic command (&quot;Go home and find Ino&quot; would be fine, but &quot;Search the town for anything suspicious&quot; would not).  They will complete it to the best of their ability and then return to you, but for every day in which they are beyond the listed range, its Swarm Size is reduced by one.\n\n______________________\n\n##### --( Hijutsu: Mushiyose - Secret Technique: Insect Gathering )--\nBy touching the ground and sending their chakra out in a web-like pattern, they can attract the attention of nearby insects to follow the chakra signal and come to the aburame.  Since they can communicate with them, it can be a handy way to gain some basic information about an area.\n\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra:  X\n  -  Speed: X\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n  -  Area: X*5\n\nEffects:  Any insects within X*5 yards are drawn to you, which you can then gather information from.  Most insects are generally only concerned with very primitive things (eating, survival, and reproduction), and therefore are limited in what they may know, but will communicate what they can.  Keep in mind this is not a capacity to *talk* to insects, merely communicate with them.\n\n\\page\n\n\n______________________\n\n##### --( Fujin Kikaichuu - Female Destruction Bugs )--\nEvery Aburame has female bugs, but not every Aburame can use them in combat. Naturally, female bugs are treated like queens and never leave the Aburame's body. Some Aburame, however, have learned to deploy female Kikaichuu as mobile relays that entice and command their kikaichuu more effectively.\n\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: +5\n  -  Speed: +4\n  -  Range: Variable\n\nEffects:\nThe range of this technique is based upon the size of the swarm you're using and the action it's used alongside.  It can be added to an attack or a defense action.  If the action is successful, you also implant on the target a Female Kikai.\n\nThey get an Awareness Roll versus the normal Stealth roll for Kikai hiding when it's attached, but thereafter the female Kikai is considered to be in Stealth 3, and they typically have no reason to suspect its presence.  It is a Speed 2 action for someone to crush a female kikai that they've found on themselves.\n\nFor as long as the Female Kikai is attached, the Aburame has a +5 Awareness bonus against the person it's attached to, Insect Bite has it's Accuracy bonus increased to X/2,  and they're always considered to be 1 Stealth level lower than they really are.  If this would mean that they are not Stealthed at all, the Aburame can attack them with ranged attacks as normal, but can not attack with melee attacks (or have their clone do so).\n\nYou can only attach a single Female Kikai to one person (attaching more gives no added benefit), but can deploy as many Female Kikai as you have.  Deploying Female Kikai does not reduce the level of your Swarm Size, but it does limit how many Swarm Size you can recover via Insect Cocoon.\n\n______________________\n\n\n##### --( Mushi Bunshin - Bug Clone )--\nUsing thousands of Kikai, the aburame creates a replica of themselves made out of their bugs.  While it isn't capable of taking damage well, the clone can actually use the abuame's chakra and thereby use jutsu, making it a powerful tool.\n\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n  -  Swarm Size: X\n  -  Special: 1 Willpower, 1 Female Kikai\n\nEffects:  \nYou create a clone of yourself, dedicating one or more ranks of your Swarm Size to the clone. It counts as having your HP and defenses (For purposes of wounding) but you only have to deal wounds enough to reduce it's Swarm Size to 0. (Via normal Kikaichuu rules)\n\nOnce the Swarm Size used to make the clone is reduced to 0, the clone is destroyed.   You can voluntarily dismiss the clone (As a Speed X action) to turn the clone back into a regular Swarm, but not the Willpower.  The Swarm Size used to create this clone reduces your current and maximum Swarm Size (you can't 'replace' the swarm size for this jutsu with Insect Cocoon).\n\nThe clone can perform any jutsu you know, but has no chakra of its own, using your chakra/stamina for anything it does.  It acts only when you spend AP for it to do so, and it can't act again until an IC has passed equal to the speed of its action.  You may hide amongst your clones (and others may Observe them) as normal, but if they do or react in a way that makes it obvious they're bugs (such as taking less damage from a Taijutsu attack, or being immune to grapples or various status effects), it is obvious that they're a clone.\n\nWhen Bug Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category.\n\n[1 AP] Dodge or Parry (at their normal speed, which can be lowered by AP as normal).\n\n[Variable AP]  The clone may make any basic unarmed or weapon attack, paying 1 AP per X speed of that action.\n\n[Variable AP]  The clone can perform any jutsu you know, paying 1 AP per X speed of that action.  It uses your DEX to determine Seal Speeds, which have to be paid for by AP as well.\n<img \n  src='https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/narutopediabr/images/d/d9/MushiBunshinnoJutsu.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100610000330&path-prefix=pt' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n______________________\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Mushi Jamingu no Jutsu - Bug Jamming Technique )--\nThe abuame uses a large amount of their insects to cover a wide area of the battlefield, and then transmits their chakra to the insects, which cover the field in it.  Depending on the whims of the Aburame, they can produce a wide variety of effects.\n\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X\n  -  Speed: 15 + X\n  -  Upkeep: X\n  -  Area: X*3\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: X Swarm Size\n\nEffects:  \nYou create a cloud of Kikai that can be used to do one of several things.  You pick one from the list below when the jutsu is used, and can switch between them as a Speed 10 action without repaying the cost, so long as the upkeep is still being maintained.\n\nThe Swarm used for this technique can not be used to do other things (attack, defend, create clones) until the technique is dismissed.  You are immune to the penalties of this technique, but can benefit from its effects (when using Disrupt Chakra Sensors, namely).\n\n  -  Disrupt Chakra Sensors - While maintaining this field, you take no penalty for the upkeep of your Kikaichuu (or this technique) when someone tries to sense you, and instead have a bonus to your Chakra Control roll of X*2 to disguise yourself from Scanning attempts.  Chakra Sensors/Chakra Sensitive people are not able to sense anyone within the field when someone advantages a fatigue level, or when they make a Chakra Exhaustion roll.\n\n  -  Obstruct Vision - By constantly keeping in motion and following a synchronized pattern, the beetles can obstruct anyone's vision who is within the field.  While not an actual hindrance to movement, they impose a -X Visibility Penalty to anyone inside of it, or anyone attacking into the field, for as long as it's maintained.\n\n  -  Chakra Drain - Anyone inside of the field who attempts do anything requiring a Chakra roll while within the field takes a penalty to their roll equal to X/2, which persists until they leave the field.  Unlike normal penalties to Chakra Exhaustion roll, it does not go away when you advance a Fatigue level.</text>\n  \nYou start with 1 Swarm Size when you first buy Parasitic Destruction Insect Technique and get 1 more for each rank in it. These points reflect the maximum size your swarm can be at any given time. You can deploy all of it at once, or keep some of it safe while you use a bit of it. If you lose points in your swarm, they regenerate at a rate of 1 per 3 OOC hours. If you let all your females die, this rate is doubled.\n\nWhen your swarm is deployed it has one Female Kikai with it for every 2 Swarm Size the swarm is strong, and one dies every time it goes down 2 Swarm Size.  For every additional Female Kikai you have in the swarm past the first you gain +1 strike with your Clan Techniques.\n\nBelow are all the ways in which you can use your Swarm.  In all cases, X equal to or less than your Swarm Size.  \n\n  -  Deploy (Speed X) - This creates a cloud of Kikaichuu around you that extends X yard(s) out from you.  You gain an upkeep equal to X. While deployed, any time the Aburame is hit by an area attack, the swarm loses 1 point, plus an additional point per level of wound the Aburame took. (+1 for Minor, +2 for Major, etc.) Every time the Aburame is inflicted damage by 5 IC of Ignite it also causes the swarm to lose 1 point. If the Swarm Size is above 10, the amount of points your swarm loses is doubled.\n\n  -  Return (Speed X/2 or +X/2, Interrupt) - An aburame may recall their Kikaichuu as an Interrupt to have them return to their body as they dodge.  A successful dodge means they return without being hit; a failed dodge means they are hit and damaged, but return thereafter. \n\\page\n\n## Akimichi\nOne of the four noble clans of Leaf, the Akimichi do not come off as particularly detached from, or superior to, others--none of the noble clans do (well, perhaps the Hyuuga), but the Akimichi in particular are, at least as a general rule, gregarious and altruistic.\n<Br>\n\nThe typical Akimichi is of below-average height and stockily built. Some are overweight, others husky or muscular. This is partly genetics, and partly the result of the unique jutsu they possess, which allow them to manipulate their physical structure and rapidly convert calories directly into chakra.\n<Br>\n\nA tradition within the Akimichi clan, though by no means an enforced one, is for the shinobi members to place some manner of design on their cheeks in facepaint, chosen after they become genin. Some change it upon rising in ranks, while others go the opposite direction and opt to get it tattooed on. Common examples are spirals, triangle designs, and concentric circles.\n<Br>\nSince before Konoha was found the Akimichi, Nara, and Yamanaka clans have collaborated closely with one another, and most Akimichi will unreservedly let their loyalty to their compatriots be known.\n\n\n##### Akimichi begin with 1 less Unique Point.\n\n<Br>\n\n#### -=[ Calorie Control ]=-\n\n#### --( Calorie Conversion )--\nAkimichi can convert excess calories to chakra. This can be used for just about anything that requires chakra, though it's most efficient when combined with their clan's techniques. Overuse of this ability results in them literally eating away at their own body; once all the fat stores have been used, muscles and organ tissue is converted next.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 4\n  -  Scale: 0\n  -  Limit: RES / 10\nEffects:\nEach time you take of this ability you gain five Calorie Points (CP). CP can be spent to lower the Chakra cost of any Akimichi clan jutsu at a 1:1 ratio, to a minimum of 0. You can spend them to reduce the cost of any other jutsu at a 3:1 ratio, but not below half that technique's normal cost.\n\nAlternately, you can spend CP to lower your Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina penalty. It takes 2 Calorie Points to lower either penalty by 1. Finally, you can spend 50 CP to not advanced a Fatigue category when failing a Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina roll.\n\nIn dire circumstances, you may spend HP in place of CP. This may only be done once you have 0 CP remaining. Every 2 HP spent takes the place of 1 CP.\n\nYou recover RES/5 calories per day, or half that amount if you can't eat at least two full meals. You can choose to stop at your maximum (5 per rank) or go up to double that value (with 4 ranks, you'd have a normal maximum of 20, and a true maximum of 40). Every ten CP you are over your normal max (round up) incurs a -1 penalty to Accuracy with Taijutsu, dodge rolls, Athletics rolls, and any other rolls which depend upon mobility. Any time you move (as a move action, or part of another action) the total distance you travel is reduced by a number of yards equal to that penalty.\n\nDo note that as you use calories in battle, that penalty will go away.\n\n<img \n  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/0/0e/Akimichi_clan.png/revision/latest?cb=20150822041719' \n  style='width:325px' />\n#### --( Akimichi Energy Bars )--\nTasty, individually-wrapped energy bars which come in dozens of flavors, including peanut butter, chocolate chip, blackberry, celery, and milk. They're packed full of calories and simple-carbohydrates, and Akimichi are able to metabolize them almost instantly.\n  -  Type: Item\n  -  Cost: 20 Ryo each\nEffects:\nEating a bar is a Speed 4 action that restores 5+(RES)/20 Calories. You may only eat up to (RES)/20 energy bars in an eight-hour period; any more, and you're too full to keep eating.\n\nYou may eat more than one energy bar at once, by adding 2 to the Speed of the action per energy bar beyond the first.\n\n\n\\page\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n##### --( Baika no Jutsu - Multi-Size Technique )--\nThe primary jutsu of the Akimichi clan, this increases the user's body size drastically; due to the extreme amounts of chakra necessary to cause such drastic growth, it's usually powered by the clan's calorie control techniques.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 15 + X/2\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 10\nEffects:\nYou subtract X points from your AGI, and add X to your STR and RES. The maximum value for X is 10 + XP/100. You can't reduce your AGI below half its maximum value using this technique.\n\n##### The following effects apply during Baika no Jutsu:\n  -  Your physical damage bonus' divisor is reduced by X/10, to a minimum of STR/12.\n  -   You ignore any immobilization penalties of X/5 or less; higher penalties are not reduced.\n  -  All your unarmed attacks gain Area X/10, or have their existing Area increased by that amount.\n  -  You gain a damage reduction of X.\n  -   You have a -5 penalty to Stealth rolls.\n  -  You reduce the severity of any Stuns inflicted upon you by X/10, and any effects which would move you involuntarily will move you X/5 fewer yards.\n\nOnce this has been used in a battle, you may alter the value of X as a Speed 5 action without paying the cost. You may not take X higher than the original value you paid for. For example, Chouji has 1200 XP and uses Baika no Jutsu; X could be any number from 1 to (10+1200/100) = 22. If he uses Baika no Jutsu as a Chakra 25 (X = 20) action, he could then take a Speed 5 action to set the value of his attribute changes anywhere from +/-1 to +/-20, but to go any higher he'd have to pay for Baika no Jutsu again.\n\n\n##### --( Nikudan Sensha - Human Bullet Tank )--\nAfter enlarging with the multi-size technique, the Akimichi tucks their limbs in and uses chakra to propel themselves in a powerful roll across the ground.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 25 to begin, 15 per attack\n  -  Damage: (STR/10)d8\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu active\nEffects:\nWhile maintaining this technique, you are considered to be rolling. While rolling you automatically block any attacks against you, unless you choose to dodge; you cannot parry or perform handseals, and have a -5 Awareness penalty.\n\nIf you deal damage with this technique its Speed is reduced to 5 (though remains 15 for the purpose of dealing damage). You may attack them again as a Speed 5 action, though may not reduce its Speed with AP (and in this case, it does count as Speed 5 to determine damage).\n\nAfter you've missed someone, you cannot target that same person for 25 IC, as it takes time for you to turn and hit them again. \n\nWhile you maintain Nikudan Sensha's Upkeep, you move 25% faster and halve any Immobilization penalties on you (after determining whether or not they're ignored by Baika/Cho Baika). You cannot be physically parried by anyone who has less than 75% of your modified STR.\n\n\n##### --( Bubun Baika no Jutsu - Partial Multi-Size Technique )--\nA more situational variation upon the multi-size technique, this temporarily enlarges only a single part of the body. Most commonly the arms are chosen, for the sake of a quick offense, but legs are equally viable.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 5 + X/3\n  -  Speed: +2\nEffects:\nThis supplements another action (typically a taijutsu attack). For the duration of that action you gain +X STR, to a maximum of double your normal STR. You also gain up to X/10 of the effects from Baika no Jutsu's list. You cannot use this while Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu are active.\n\n\n##### --( Nikudan Hari Sensha - Spiked Human Bullet Tank )--\nThe Akimichi attaches dozens of kunai to multiple lengths of wire which they then drape loosely around their body. When they increase in size the wires become taut, and the kunai form rings of spikes around their body. While this is certainly effective as a means of attack, the real purpose is much simpler: the kunai function like cleats, aiding in turning.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 30 to begin, 20 per attack\n  -  Damage: (STR/8)d10\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu active\nEffects:\nThis functions the same as Nikudan Sensha, but is blocked as if it were a weapon attack. Anyone who makes physical contact with you or comes within melee range (including most weapon attacks) takes half this technique's damage (based on Speed 15). This does not apply to people who you attack (as they already take damage, from being attacked).\n\nEvery consecutive attack against the same person, without you missing, does 10% more damage. Turning after missing a target takes only 10 IC, rather than 15.\n\nUsing Nikudan Hari Sensha requires at least 30 specially prepared kunai, which may be used repeatedly in this technique. Repurposing them as regular throwing weapons (i.e. removing them from their wire) does mean they can no longer be used for this.\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Cho Harite - Mega Palm Thrust )--\nThe user, already enlarged, pours still more chakra into their palms, causing them to increase drastically in size. Surging with enough chakra for it to be physically visible, the Akimichi's palms are as strong as iron.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 40 + X\n  -  Speed: +6\n  -  Requires: Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu active\nEffects:\nThis increases the Area of a taijutsu attack it's used alongside with (though not ones which specify they are only kicks, and not Akimichi clan jutsu) by X, and your damage bonus by X/5. X has a maximum value of CHA/20 in Baika no Jutsu, and CHA/10 in Chou Baika no Jutsu.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Cho Baika no Jutsu - Super Multi-Size Technique )--\nEssentially a scaled-up version of the Akimichi's regular multi-size technique, this increases the user (and their clothing) to gigantic proportions; even the weakest users will be as tall as a building, and with enough energy invested this can let someone easily tower over most trees.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 15 + X\n  -  Upkeep: 5 + X/4\n  -  Speed: 15\nEffects:\nIf used when already in Baika no Jutsu, this temporarily replaces that technique's effects, and Cho Baika's cost is reduced by half the X value used in Baika no Jutsu. Its Speed is reduced to 10.\n\nYour AGI is reduced by X*1.5, and your STR and RES are increased by X*2. X may not be more than half your maximum AGI, and may not be less than one quarter your maximum AGI.\n\nWhen active, the following effects are applied:\n  -  Your physical damage bonus is calculated as STR/12.\n  -   You ignore immobilization penalties of X/5 or less.\n  -  All your unarmed attacks gain Area X/5, or have their existing Area increased by that amount.\n  -  You gain a damage reduction of X*1.25\n  -  You cannot hide.\n  -  You may choose to automatically block any incoming attacks.\n  -  Your movement speed is calculated without including the penalty from Cho Baika no Jutsu.\n  -  You can grapple someone using only a single hand. This does allow you to, potentially, hold one person in each hand.\n  -  You reduce the severity of any Stuns inflicted upon you by X/8, and any effects which would move you involuntarily will move you X/4 fewer yards.\n```\n```\n\n\n\n##### --( Chodan Bakugeki - Butterfly Bullet Bombing )--\nThis technique is typically only usable after an Akimichi has consumed a red food pill, due to its extreme chakra requirements; in fact, that's where it got its name. The amount of chakra produced from consuming a red pill is so excessive that the Akimichi's body has to vent it off, resulting in visible plumes of chakra bursting from their shoulderblades in a display reminiscent of butterfly wings.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 250\n  -  Damage: (STR/5)d20\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Area: Physical damage bonus *2\n\nEffects:\nThis adds your physical and ninjutsu damage bonuses together to determine its damage bonus. The primary target takes full damage; anyone else caught in the area takes only the damage from your damage bonuses.\n\n\n##### -=[ Sanshoku no Gan'yaku - Three-Colored Pills ]=-\nA secret medicine developed and used exclusively by the Akimichi clan, these three pills converts stored energy into chakra to give the user a tremendous boost in power. Understandably, these are exceptionally potent in the hands of an Akimichi.\n\nEven so, there's a good reason they're not widely used. They're not gentle on the body, and the chemicals released by the pills in the process are actually toxic. Eating a pill is a Speed 4 action.\n\nDespite their names, they don't taste like food. They taste like... well, poison.\n\nAll pills have some effects in common. When you use a pill, you will gain some amount of Calorie Points. This is based on your true maximum (10 per rank of Calorie Conversion), and can take you above it. While under the effects of pills, you suffer no penalties from having too many CP. When a pill's effects end, you lose CP equal to however many it gave you.\n\nAnyone other than an Akimichi who takes these pills suffers half the base Poison for half the base duration, and receives none of the benefits.\n\nWhen a pill's effects expire, you can let it end or take a higher-strength pill as a non-action. So long as you are under the effects of one of the three pills, you ignore all penalties caused by these pills. If you use one while another is in effects (for example, you take the Green pill, and 20 IC later you take the Yellow pill) you overwrite all the effects (including the Poison) of the lower-strength pill, but keep any extra calories you have from it.\n\nAkimichi are issued only one of each pill at a time. Giving these pills away is treason, and it's a credit to the clan that to date no Akimichi has done so.\n\\page\n\n\n\n##### --(Hourengan - Green Spinach Pill )--\nYou gain half your maximum Calorie Points. The ratios for spending CP improve, becoming 1:2 for Akimichi clan jutsu, 2:1 for non-clan jutsu, and 1:1 to reduce your Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina penalty.\n\nFor the duration you are immune to knockback and have all your attributes increased by 10%. When you take the pill, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is reset to 0. When this ends, your Fatigue is increased by 2 categories.\n  Duration: 50 + RES/5\n  Poison: 3 - (RES/50)\n\n<Br>\n##### --( Karengan - Yellow Curry Pill )--\nYou gain your maximum Calorie Points. The ratios for spending CP improve, becoming 1:3 for Akimichi clan jutsu, 1:1 for non-clan jutsu, and 1:2 to reduce your Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina penalty.\n\nFor the duration you are immune to knockback and halve the effects of stuns, and have all your attributes increased by 15%. When you take the pill, your Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina penalties are reset to 0. When this ends, your Fatigue is increased by 4 categories.\n  Duration: 100 + RES/4\n  Poison: 6 - (RES/50)\n\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Tongarashigan - Red Chilli Pill )--\nYou gain double your maximum Calorie Points. The ratios for spending CP improve, becoming 1:5 for Akimichi clan jutsu, 1:2 for non-clan jutsu, and 1:3 to reduce your Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina penalty.\n\nFor the duration you are immune to knockback, and the effects of Stuns and Paralysis effects are divided by four (round down). All your attributes are increased by 25%. When you take the pill, your Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina penalties are reset to 0 and your Fatigue is lowered by 2 categories. When this ends, your Fatigue is increased by 8 categories.\n  Duration: 100 + RES/2\n  Poison: 9 - (RES/40)\n\n\nAs you may notice, it's quite easy to go above &quot;Fatigue 6&quot;, which is to say, unconsciousness, by using these pills. Pushing your body that far is dangerous, and hard to recover from.\n\nFor every Fatigue category you are beyond unconscious (i.e. Fatigue 8 would be 2 over), one Fatigue level takes an entire week to heal. For example, if you were at Fatigue 9, you would be (7, 8, 9) 3 levels above unconscious. This means that once you woke up, it would take a week to recover from Fatigue 5, another week to recover from Fatigue 4, another week to recover from Fatigue 3, and you'd then recover normally.\n\nAfter this effect takes place, you cannot regain any calorie points or receive the benefits of food pills (they're still poison, though) until you've fully healed from all Fatigue.\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.188624045.6315/flat,800x800,075,f.u4.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \n  \\page\n## Inuzuka\nLike the ninken (ninja dogs) they fight alongside, the Inuzuka are both highly spirited and very loyal -- to the good of Konohagakure and to their individual friends. Despite being one of the smaller clans in Konoha, their presence has long been valued by the village as a whole.\n\nFor decades they have contributed to the strength of Konoha's scouting and tracking units, aided greatly by their ninken. Inuzuka medics often double as veterinarians, and many retire to work as vets or breeders once they've finished serving as proper ninja. Most Inuzuka, even if not permanently assigned to tracking squads, will be temporarily 'borrowed' to assist with missions where their skills will come in handy at some point in their career.\n\nPhysically, Inuzuka tend to be easily identifiable by the traditional red markings on their cheeks and slightly more fang-like canines. An Inuzuka is very rarely seen far from his or her ninken, even from childhood years. An Inuzuka's dog is a friend, playmate, and ally in battle. Inuzuka train with their ninken starting even before their academy years, ultimately culminating in some of Konoha's most physically destructive taijutsu.\n\nThe Inuzuka are often characterized as blunt and rough around the edges, taking things from playful to what most others would consider hurtful. Nonetheless, they're very protective of their teammates and typically mean well.\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n##### --( Tsuga - Passing Fang )--\nThe user spins his body at incredible speeds, the surrounding chakra and air creating the appearance of a long vortex rotating along its axis. The user in this state then rushes to make direct contact with the victim. It can be extremely damaging, as it is capable of ripping through great tree trunks or chakra-reinforced earth barriers.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank D\n  -  Stamina: 20 + X\n -  Damage: (STR /10)d10\n  -  Range: AGI\n  -  Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nThe effectiveness of partial defense is doubled against this technique; for every 1 point it hits by, it deals 10% damage. Every time someone is hit by this technique, they remove 1 off the top of their partial defenses. (For example, I needed to hit 10 above to get 100%, now I only need to hit 9 above. 8 being 90%, so on.) This resets to normal if you choose to take a non-Tsuga, non-interrupt action. Every time you use this after the first, consecutively, this technique's Stamina, Speed, and Range are only considered to be half. Blocking is only 25% effective against this technique.\n\nTsuga's range is reduced by anything that would reduce your ability to move (such as immobilization penalties); when you use Tsuga, you cross to melee range with your target. The &quot;X&quot; in Tsuga's Stamina cost is (the number of yards you move this way)/10, rounded down.\n\n```\n```\n\n##### --( Shikyaku no Jutsu - Four Legs Technique )--\nUsing this technique, the user takes on much more animalistic mannerisms, hunching down to all-fours and baring his teeth, for example. Even his physical characteristics become more animal-like: canines and fingernails grow into fangs and claws, pupils become slitted rather than rounded. More importantly, the user's reflexes, senses, speed and strength rise in power dramatically. The Inuzuka often utilize this technique to launch effective hit-and-run offenses against an opponent.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Upkeep: 3\n  -  Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nYour AGI counts 20% higher for purposes of movement and the range of your clan jutsu. You also gain a +3 bonus to Awareness and Survival, though while you are using this, you cannot make handseals except for Inuzuka clan jutsu.\n\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Jujin Bunshin - Beast Human Clone )-- \nDerived from the basic Henge, this technique transforms the ninken into the likeness of its owner, though the ninken will still behave like an animal in this form. However, together with the Shikyaku no Jutsu, the two become virtually indistinguishable. Gatsuga often follows quickly upon use of this technique. This technique also shares the same basic weaknesses of Henge.  \n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 15 \n  -  Upkeep: 3 \n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Seal Speed: 6 \n\nEffects: \nThis technique changes your dog into a lookalike of you. In this form it can now use Tsuga as well . Unlike regular Henge, this technique will be broken only when the dog is knocked out of action (The Inuzuka takes a Major or Higher wound).  \n\\page\n\n\n\n##### --( Gatsuga - Fang Passing Fang )-- \nTsuga twice over.  Both shinobi and transformed ninken coordinate their Tsuga movements to most effectively devastate the opponent or create an opening. Thus Gatsuga is typically much more difficult to avoid than Tsuga.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Stamina: 25 + X/10\n  -  Damage: (STR /6)d10\n  -  Range: AGI\n  -  Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nThis attack uses two accuracy rolls, one for you and the dog. First, determine if the attack which rolled higher hits; if it does, the attack with the lower result has its accuracy increased by 5. For example, if you rolled 1d20+8 -&gt; 12+8 -&gt; 20 for yourself, and 1d20+6 -&gt; 9+6 -&gt; 15 for your dog, you'd see if 20 hit whatever defense your opponent used. If it did, your dog's attack's accuracy would be raised to 15 -&gt; 20. This counts as performing Tsuga twice, though there is no reduction of Stamina or Speed, only Range for consecutive use of this.\n\nYou must spend 10 AP and your ninken must have an activation within the speed of this attack, missing it's next activation. You combine the damage of you and your ninken's attacks for purposes of wounding. If you wound, it is treated as two separate wounds (1 Piercing, 1 Blunt) of a lower severity.\n\nGatsuga follows the same rules as Tsuga for traveling to your enemy, and increasing the Stamina cost accordingly.\n\n\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Jinju Konbi Henge: Sotoro - Human Beast Combination Transformation: Double-Headed Wolf )-- \nThis fearsome transformation technique combines shinobi and ninken into a massive two-headed wolf. While being in this form has its obvious benefits, this technique is most valued as an essential preparation for the Inuzuka's most devastating form of Tsuga.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Upkeep: 7\n  -  Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nYour dog combines with you and may no longer take separate actions. You gain a +4 bonus to Acc and D20 Rolls. Your physical damage bonus is increased by 3. You also gain a +5 bonus to Awareness and Survival, though while you are using this, you cannot make handseals or stealth.\n\nThis technique overrides Four Legs technique, and will automatically stop it if used. (It cannot be used while you maintain this either!) If you take a Major wound, you are separated.\n\n\n```\n```\n\n##### --( Garouga - Wolf Passing Fang )--\nIn Sotoro form, the user creates a vortex similar to Tsuga; however, the speed and power of Garouga far surpasses any of its lower forms. In fact, the user spins so rapidly during the technique that he loses his effective field of vision. The target is tracked, instead, by scent, the Inuzuka using their enhanced canine senses to find their opponents. Inuzuka have split opponents right in two with direct hits from this attack.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank B\n  -  Stamina: 50\n  -  Damage: (STR /4)d12\n  -  Range: AGI\n  -  Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nWhen you use this technique, make an opposed Survival vs. Athletics roll. If opponent succeeds in their Athletics check, they add the amount they won by to their defense against this jutsu.\n\nPartial defenses have no effect against this jutsu, and unless you dodge it by 5, you still take 50% of the damage. This technique bypasses blocking, DR, cannot be parried by weapons or unarmed and if you wound someone it is treated as three separate wounds (1 Piercing, 1 Blunt, 1 Slashing) of a lower severity. This jutsu's damage also counts 50% higher for purposes of wounding.\n\nGarouga follows the same rules as Tsuga for traveling to your enemy, and increasing the Stamina cost accordingly.\n\\page\n\n\n\n##### Ninken\nYour ninken, or ninja dog, is more than just an extra weapon in combat; it's a living creature with its own capabilities. However, its advancement is intextricably tied to your own.\n\nThe values below are based on your XP.\n\n<BBr>\n\n##### -=[ Skills ]=-\n\nYour dog also has the following ranks in these skills:\nAwareness: 5 + XP/300\nStealth: 5 + XP/500\nSurvival: 5 + XP/200\n\nIn other words, your dog starts with 5 ranks in Survival, Awareness, and Stealth. It gains XP/200 ranks in Survival, XP/300 ranks in Awareness, and XP/500 ranks in Stealth.\n\nIf you and your dog are traveling together, you may reroll a skill check, using your dogs skill. This only works with the three skills it has.\n\nThis does not apply in combat, and does not apply when you two are separated; if you have your dog wait in hiding somewhere while you go elsewhere, it uses its own rolls. \n\n<Br>\n\n##### -=[ Actions ]=-\n\nWhen fighting with you, the dog can act every 20 IC. It uses your stats for it's attacks and counts as suffering from any status effects you are. There are three things the dog can do when it acts:\n\n   -  Basic Attack\nSpeed 8, (Dex/6)d6 and uses half your PDB.\n\n\n   -  Grab\nJust as E-rank Grapple. This uses your relevant stats at 60%.\n\n\n   -  Stealth\nYour dog uses stealth! It's basic attack uses your full PDB if it gets to surprise attack.\n\n\nUsing Beast Human Clone, it can perform Tsuga and for the grapple is uses 80% of your relevant stats. This has an AP cost equal to half the action's base Speed; the actual Speed of the technique may then be modified further by spending more AP.\n\nYour dog does not need to dodge, it cannot be targeted or caught in an aoe. When an Inuzuka is dealt a wound of Major or Higher, the dog is knocked out of action for 10 IC per severity (Major is 10 IC, Severe is 20 IC, etc.). The severity of wounds caused by area techniques is one higher for this consideration alone. (A Minor wound from an area technique would knock the dog out for 10 IC, a Major for 20 IC, etc.) A Critical from an area technique will knock the dog out for the rest of the combat. If the dog is already knocked out, the duration it's knocked out cannot be extended, only once it's back up can be beat down again.\n\nWhen fighting alone, your dog can use your dodge with a -6 penalty, but if it's hit once, by anything that deals damage, it's knocked out.\n\n\n```\n```\n<img \n  src='https://orig00.deviantart.net/ba50/f/2008/005/b/e/kuromaru_is_badass_by_totallyspiesfreak.png' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \n##### -=[ Dog Abilities ]=-\n\nThese are obtained automatically, once every 500 XP. Choose one from the list below; you may not take an ability more than once unless it says so.\n\n\n   -  Good Nose:\nYour dog has +3 ranks in Survival, and +1 rank in Awareness. You may take this ability up to 5 times.\n\n   -  Sneaky:\nYour dog has +3 ranks in Stealth, and +1 rank in Survival. You may take this twice.\n\n   -  Swift:\nThe dog gains a +2 Dodge when it's on it's own. This can be taken three times.\n\n   -  Vicious:\nYour dog's basic attack die size goes up to D8s. You can take this a second time to make it D10s.\n\n   -  Well-Trained:\nYour dog has +1 rank in Awareness, Stealth, and Survival. You may take this up to 5 times.\n\n\\page\n## Hyuuga\nThroughout their history, the Hyuuga have adhered closely to a tradition of segregating family members into either the Main House or the Branch House, typically on the basis of gender and sibling birth order. Members of the Main House control and direct the affairs of the Hyuuga clan at large, whereas the Branch House is tasked with faithfully serving and protecting members of the Main House and -- in a wider scope -- the interests of the entire Hyuuga clan.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nThis practice of sealing Branch House family members, however, came to its end through the concerted influence of three famed Hyuuga of the Fourth Shinobi World War.  Thanks to their tireless spirit, cooperation, and heroic reputation garnered from the War, they won the crucial number of Main House members to their side, greatly healing a rift between the houses that had been ever-widening in previous decades.  Soon afterward, the head of the Hyuuga clan decreed that thenceforth none would be branded with the seal. \n\n<Br>\n\nWith the divide between the houses now gone, the Hyuuga have risen to prominence both within and beyond their village as one of the most noble clans of Konoha.  They are widely known for the distinct milky-white eyes, dark hair, and sophistication in the way they dress and talk.  Shinobi of other nations tend to be wary of them, as their gentle fist style of fighting makes it impossible to tell just how competent a Hyuuga may be by their physical stature, with legends of one touch being enough to cripple an opponent.\n\n\n##### Hyuuga begin with 1 less Unique Point.\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Byakugan - White Eye )--\n\n<Br>\nActivating the Byakugan is a Speed 0, Seal Speed 6 action; it can't be used as an interrupt. Once you've reduced its Seal Speed to 0, you no longer have to perform handseals to activate it. Byakugan has an Upkeep of 2.\n\n<Br>\n\nYou can differentiate between people and clones (except for Kage Bunshin), and tell if someone is using Henge (though this does not allow you to see their true form).\n\n<Br>\n\nThe Byakugan allows you to see through physical objects (though you're still aware of their presence). This gives you, in crude terms, &quot;X-ray vision&quot;, except you see chakra instead of bones and dense objects. You can see everything in a CHA yard radius around you this way.  \n<Br>\n\nThis allows you to spot jutsu-based traps and effects, and detect the presence of fuinjutsu placed on a person, item, or area.  When actively searching for an opponent in combat, you have a +10 bonus to that Awareness roll. \n\nIt also means that you're immune to all visibility penalties from external sources, such as blindfolds, ninjutsu-induced mists, and smoke bombs.  You are immune to Genjutsu which target an area instead of people, can automatically see through them as if they weren't there, and can tell when someone else is being affected by a Genjutsu from the disturbance in their chakra flow.\n\n______________________\n\n##### --( Hakkeshou Kaiten - Eight Trigrams Palm Revolving Heaven )--\nThe absolute defense of the Hyuuga clan, to use this technique the ninja simultaneously releases chakra from every tenketsu in their body and begins spinning rapidly.\n\nThe combined effect is to generate a virtually impervious shield of rotating chakra; what makes it truly effective is that the chakra used won't dissipate until the user finally comes to a stop.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Stamina: 5 + X\n  -  Chakra: 5 + X\n  -  Damage: No base damage.\n  -  Speed: 6 + X\n  -  Special: Interrupt, Abort\n  -  Requires: Byakugan active\n\nEffects:\nThis technique's base Speed (6) is what is used for determining whether it can Interrupt a given attack. If used as an Interrupt, you make an accuracy roll with a +X/2 bonus against the opponent's Accuracy; failure means you are hit, but activate Kaiten immediately afterwards.\n\n<Br>\n\nKaiten lasts for its full Speed in IC after being used. For example, if you used it on IC 22 when attacked, paying 8 Chakra and Stamina, it would last until IC (22+6+3) 31. Any time after the first 6 IC have passed, you may abort Kaiten.\n\n<Br>\n\nKaiten flawlessly deflects any ninjutsu or taijutsu. Though it cannot be used to Interrupt genjutsu, you cannot be targeted by them while Kaiten is in progress.\n\n<Br>\n\nKaiten's radius is up to CHA/10 yards. Anyone in range when it's activated who fails to dodge takes damage and is knocked to the edge of the radius. If Kaiten is activated inside of a persistent AoE effect (such as a cloud, or water slick) with a radius equal to or less than its own, it ends that effect.\n\n<Br>\n\nThis technique's only true weakness is that it is ineffective if the user cannot spin. If suffering from a -6 or greater immobilization penalty, you may not utilize Kaiten.\n\n<Br>\n\nYou may not reduce Kaiten's Speed by spending AP.\n\\page\n\n\n______________________\n\n##### --( Hakke Kuushou - Eight Trigrams Empty Palm )--\nOne offensive counterpart to the defensive Hakkeshou Kaiten.  Rather than releasing chakra from all tenketsu to form a protective barrier, chakra is released from certain tenketsu, typically the forearm and palm, to create a forceful thrust, which damages an opponent at a distance.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: +5\n  -  Range: CHA/3\n  -  Speed: +2\n  -  Requires: Byakugan active\n\nEffects:\nThis is added to any Gentle Fist attack (basic attack or combo), increasing its Chakra cost and Speed accordingly. It allows those techniques to be performed at the listed range (and, accordingly, does not break combos). Because this changes those techniques into what is essentially a wave of force, it prevents them from being parried as normal unarmed taijutsu (though most ninjutsu-based defenses will still apply normally).\n\n<Br>\n\nIt cannot, however, be used to extend the range of the various Gentle Fist Finishers.\n\n______________________\n\n##### --( Juukenpo Ichigekishin -  Gentle Fist Art One Blow Body )--\nAnother offensive use of the Hyuuga's ability to release chakra from his tenketsu.  Here a force is created and directed against an opponent, or even against the espied weakness of some technique in order to dispel it, using the Byakugan's ability to see chakra.  In either case, the force created can easily send most opponents flying.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 20 + X\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Requires: Byakugan active\n\nEffects:<Br>\nThis can be used when in a grapple, or when you would, due to a jutsu restraining you (such as Water Prison), be unable to take actions. In a grapple, this immediately ends the grapple and automatically strikes your opponent with a basic attack Jyuuken.\n\n<Br>\n\nOtherwise, this immediately ends any effects restraining you, from being tied up with ropes to being trapped inside a Water Prison. If used against a jutsu, X is that technique's Upkeep (if it has one). Otherwise, X is zero.\n<br>\n\n```\n```\n\n\n\n#### -=[ Jyuuken - Gentle Fist ]=-\n\nJyuuken is a special way of fighting which works by infusing one's blows with chakra and injecting it directly into the opponent's bodies at weak points on their chakra circulatory system.\n\nThere are two ways of performing jyuuken. The first is as a basic unarmed attack, as follows:\n\n##### --( Jyuuken - Gentle Fist )--\nThe offensive combat style of the Hyuuga. Making use of Byakugun's ability to see an opponent's chakra flow, the user engages in what seem to merely be graceful taijutsu strikes.  In reality, with every contact the Jyuuken user is injecting his own chakra into calculated points within the opponent's chakra flow, sealing them off and damaging internal organs directly.  Save for unique physiology or other abilities, Jyuuken is notoriously difficult to defend against once contact is made.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank E\n  -  Stamina: 5\n  -  Damage: 1d4\n  -  Special: Opener\n  -  Speed: 8\nEffects:\nJyuuken uses half your ninjutsu damage bonus, instead of your taijutsu damage bonus. Its damage cannot be blocked, and it cannot be stopped by armor. Jyuuken's damage is dealt directly to an opponent's HP.\n\n\nYou may also 'convert' any Combo Taijutsu to jyuuken. This represents you adapting the basic concepts of it to the unique Hyuuga style; virtually all jyuuken strikes are delivered with relatively light finger-jabs (inflicting their injury through the bursts of chakra).\n<Br>\n\nThis techniques use your ninjutsu, rather than physical, damage bonus, cannot be stopped by armor, and reduce the effectiveness of blocking by 25%. Techniques converted this way gain a Chakra cost equal to their Stamina cost. You cannot switch from a regular combo to a jyuuken combo, though you can go from an ordinary Opener to a jyuuken combo.\n<Br>\n\nIf you have amassed a Combo Counter from performing jyuuken combos, you will be able to use one of several jyuuken-specified finishers, listed below.\n\n______________________\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Hakke Sanjuuni Shou - Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms )--\nA simplified version of the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms. As its complexity and difficulty are reduced, it's easier for novice Hyuuga to learn, and has some advantages in battles when one needs a quick advantage, lacking the time or energy to resort to more advanced versions of the technique.\n\nThe user launches into a series of high-speed jyuuken strikes at an enemy, aiming to temporarily disable them--more advanced versions can effectively remove an opponent from the battle entirely, and while Thirty-Two Palms typically lacks that capability, it's nonetheless a force to be reckoned with.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank D\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Damage: 1d6\n  -  Special: Finisher\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: Byakugan active\n \nCombo Bonus: +1 Stun, +1d6 damage, Special\n\nEffects:\nFor the combo bonus, you may choose between one of the following three effects:\n  -  (Combo Counter)/3 Sealed Tenketsu \n  <Br>\n  -  (Combo Counter)/2 Paralysis, with a Duration of (Combo Counter)*5\n  <Br>\n  -  (Combo Counter) Immobilization, with a Duration of (Combo Counter)*5\n\n______________________\n\n##### --( Hakke Rokujuyon Shou - Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms )--\nA devastating series of Jyuuken strikes carried out in rapid succession, sealing many of the opponent's tenketsu in the process.  The strikes are made in increasing powers of two: two strikes, followed by another two, then four, then eight, then sixteen, then thirty-two, for a total of sixty-four strikes. The damage to internal organs and chakra flow is often so debilitating that the victim can no longer stand.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Stamina: 25\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Damage: 0d6\n  -  Special: Finisher\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Requires: Byakugan active\n\nCombo Bonus: +2 Stun, +1 Immobilization, +2d6 damage, Special\n\nEffects:\nThis finisher's Immobilization lasts until its stun has worn off. For the combo bonus, you may choose between one of these two effects:\n  -  (Combo Counter)/2 Sealed Tenketsu\n  -  (Combo Counter)/2 Paralysis, with a Duration of (Combo Counter)*5\n```\n```\n\n\n______________________\n\n##### --( Hakke Hyaku Nijuuhachi Shou - Eight Trigrams One Hundred Twenty-Eight Palms )--\nThe ultimate and most demanding Jyuuken combination strike, the final development of the Hakke Rokujuyon Shou.  The shinobi's speed and chakra control have reached truly amazing levels, effectively doubling the strikes made from sixty-four to one hundred twenty-eight.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank B\n  -  Stamina: 35\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Damage: 0d6\n  -  Special: Finisher\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Requires: Byakugan active\n\nCombo Bonus: +1 Sealed Tenketsu, +0.5 Paralysis, +1 Immobilize, +3 Stun, +3d6 damage\n\nEffects:\nThe Paralysis and Immobilize last until the Stun has worn off.\n\n______________________\n\n##### --( Sealed Tenketsu )--\nThis is a status effect. Every tenketsu sealed gives you a -1 penalty to Chakra Exhaustion rolls; half this total penalty is applied to your Stamina rolls. Furthermore, if you fail a Chakra Exhaustion roll while your Tenketsu are sealed, whatever technique you were trying to use fails to activate (but you advance a Fatigue level as normal) and you lose Vitality (or HP) equal to the Chakra cost of that jutsu.\n\nSealed Tenketsu stacks partially with itself. If you already have the status applied, and are struck by another attack which it inflicts it, add half (rounded down) the lower severity to the higher; this is the new severity of your Sealed Tenketsu status. For example, if you were at 3, then hit by an attack which inflicted Sealed Tenketsu 5, your status would be (5 + 3/2) = (5 + 1) = 6. Another attack with ST 3 would, then, raise you to 7.\n\n\\page\n## Nara\nA modestly-sized yet highly influential clan in Leaf, the Nara primarily use secret ninjutsu techniques which manipulate shadows, using them to disable opponents and control the battlefield.\n\n<Br>\n\nWhat they're truly known for, however, is their many medical advances. While the clan produces few talented medical nin, a disproportionate number of the advances in theory and actual, physical medicines and treatments seem to come from the Nara. The pills used by the Akimichi clan are just one example of the Nara's medical breakthroughs.\n\n<Br>\n\nThe Akimichi, Nara, and Yamanaka clan have always enjoyed a special relationship with one another, often working in teams and as allies; that bond stands at the heart of Leaf village, and is often looked to by other shinobi as an example of Konoha's unity.\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Kagemane no Jutsu - Shadow Imitation Technique )--\n<Br>\n\nThe most basic of the Nara's techniques, the user extends their shadow and links it to another person's. Once successful, the two are physically linked, giving the Nara exceptional physical control over their victim.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Range: CHA /3\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\n<Br>\nEffects:\nThis requires a ninjutsu strike with a -3 penalty, which is removed if a Flash Bomb has been used in the past 5 IC.\n<Br>\n\nThe victim can, as a Speed 10 action, attempt to break free, which is a 1d20+STR/5 OR RES/5 roll with a -5 penalty, against your 1d20+CHA/5. Every attempt to break free gives a cumulative +2 bonus. The victim may take no other actions which require physical movement.\n<Br>\n\nYou can make the target perform and taijutsu you know, use any weapon they have, and ninjutsu or genjutsu you both know, and perform any mundane tasks, including forcing them to disarm themselves. They pay the Stamina and Chakra costs for any actions you make them perform, though you must perform the same actions.\n<Br>\n\nIf you attack them, they use the same attack against you. You can use a Large weapon to attack them without being hit if they have a non-Large weapon (or no weapon), and any non-Small weapon to attack them without being hit if they have a Small weapon (or no weapon).\n<Br>\n<img \n  src='http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/narutofanon/images/a/a9/Shadow_Imitation_Technique.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20120321134034' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \n  <Br>\n  \nYou may perform any ninjutsu or genjutsu you know against them; if they know the same technique, they perform it as well, directed at you.\n<Br>\n\nYou may make them attack someone with any technique you can force them to perform, with a -3 penalty to their Accuracy. You can also attack the same target as them, at the same time. For all the above methods of controlling their actions, your Speed is advanced by the appropriate amount, and theirs is not.\n<Br>\n\nIf the victim is attacked, you can either choose to defend for them, partially relax the technique long enough for them to defend themselves, or force them to take the hit without defending. If you do this, they immediately get a roll to escape with a +5 bonus, which they may, after seeing the result, add 10 to per point of Willpower they spend.\n<Br>\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Multiple Shadow Bind )--\nYou can target multiple people with your Kagemane no Jutsu. Every person beyond the first adds 5 to Kage Mane's chakra cost, and 2 to its upkeep. You may target up to 1 additional person per rank.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 6\n  -  Scale: 4\n  -  Limit: CHA /30\n\n\n##### --( Kagebuki Shibari no Jutsu - Shadow Neck-Binding Technique )--\nA more advanced version of Shadow Imitation, this extends the user's shadow up a victim, creating elongated hands and arms to wrap around and strangle, or otherwise injure, the victim.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Speed: 16\nEffects:\nThis can be used only on someone who's already trapped by your Shadow Imitation Technique, and as such does not require an Accuracy roll. If used consecutively, its Chakra cost is reduced to 15.\n\nThis can be used to strangle, or attack. Used to strangle, it inflicts Suffocation 1 every time it's used. When you take any other action (including movement and defensive actions) the Suffocation is considered to have ended.\n\nAlternatively, you may use this to directly damage an opponent, dealing only your damage bonus multiplied by its speed. This damage cannot be reduced below half by effects such as damage reduction and jutsu. It's automatically a called shot, and wounds it inflicts cannot be prevented by armor. Defending against Shadow Neck Bind is not possible. This technique inflicts Blunt damage.\n\n\n##### --( Kage Nui no Jutsu - Shadow Sewing Technique )--\nThis materializes shadows, allowing them to physically attack and bind an opponent (and, well, leave the ground). The user reshapes their shadow into several needle-tipped tendrils and attempts to impale an enemy with them.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Damage: 8d12\n  -  Speed: 12\nEffects:\nThis cannot be used while Kagemane no Jutsu is maintained. It inflicts a -4 immobilization penalty on anyone affected; you may target as many people with Shadow Sewing as you can with Shadow Imitation, without increasing its cost. Shadow Sewing has a +3 bonus to its Accuracy.\n\nYou may use Shadow Imitation on anyone affected by Shadow Sewing, ending the latter effect and automatically snatching them in your Shadow Imitation. Someone trapped by Shadow Sewing can still take a Speed 10 action to try to break free, using the same roll as if they were escaping from Shadow Imitation. This technique deals Piercing damage.\n```\n```\n\n\n\n##### --( Kagemane Shuriken no Jutsu - Shadow Imitation Shuriken Technique )--\nBy infusing weapons with chakra, you give them the properties of your shadow techniques. Using these to pierce the enemy's shadows anchors them in place.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B\n  -  Stamina: Special\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Accuracy: +4\n  -  Speed: Special\n  -  Requires: Chakra Flow, Shadow Imitation Technique\nEffects:\nThis is a thrown weapon attack, using that attack's Stamina and Speed. It inflicts a -2 Immobilization penalty on the victim, rather than doing damage. Multiple applications of this technique can be applied to the same person, up to a maximum of -8. These penalties last until the victim has taken a Move action with a Speed of double the total penalty they're under, -1 per 40 points of STR they have.\n\n\n##### --( Kageyose no Jutsu - Shadow Endgame Technique )--\nWorking on the same principle as the Shadow Sewing Technique, this uses materialized shadows. Unlike Shadow Sewing, it allows for precise control of the shadow's movements; the user splits their shadow off into potentially dozens of fully prehensile shadow tendrils, small enough to slip through keyholes and dexterous enough to lift keys off of hooks.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Upkeep: 2\n  -  Speed: Varies\nEffects:\nYou can create shadows of tendril to grab, retrieve, and throw objects. This costs 1 AP per CHA/50 yards away the item is. Throwing them is handled as a regular thrown weapon (or multi-throw) attack, costing 1 AP per 2 Speed of the attack; you may use the Shadow Imitation Shuriken Technique with these weapons. These attacks use your ninjutsu, rather than physical, damage bonus.\n\nYou may continue to use Shadow Endgame so long as you maintain its upkeep.\n\\page\n## Senju\n\nOnce known as the Senju Clan of the Forest, and allegedly descended from the Sage of Six Paths, founder of ninjutsu, himself, the history of the Senju clan is the history of Konoha. They founded the village, the First, Second, and Fifth Hokages were all members of descendants of the clan, and it's said the First Hokage used his Senju bloodline to create the very village itself. Their name, meaning Thousand Hands, came from their peerless talents in all aspects of ninja skills: if there was every a 'greatest clan' of ninja, it was them.\n<Br>\n\nThey're also virtually extinct. The clan itself died out generations ago. Of the perhaps dozen people alive who actually were born with the Senju name, almost none of them actually manifest their clan's abilities.\n<Br>\n\nThe bloodline is as persistent and hardy as the forests it symbolizes, though. In every generation, a handful of ninja will be born who exhibit the traits of the Senju bloodline, and inevitably their lineage will be traced a Senju ancestor, sometimes more than a century distant. Some even unofficially take the Senju name out of respect.\n<Br>\n\nSenju begin with Elemental Aptitude for Water and Earth. They have Elemental Affinity for Mokuton, which includes Sution and Doton.\n\n##### Senju begin with 1 less Unique Point.\n<Br>\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Mokuton - Wood Release )--\nThe Senju bloodline, once famed for their limitless talents, have fallen far, but one trait remains--or, rather, it's the only one that can be recognized as a sign of Senju heritage. That is Mokuton, combining Water and Earth natured chakra to produce wood-related jutsu. It should be noted that this is wood, specifically, and to a lesser extent, trees--they don't have (despite what legends claim) plant empathy, the ability to restore life to wilting flowers, or anything similar.\n\nAny Suiton or Doton technique can be converted to Mokuton, with the following effects:\n  -  +5 Chakra cost\n  -  Gallon requirements for Suiton techniques are removed.\n  -  Suiton techniques which normally apply visibility penalties to any area instead apply Immobilization penalties with a severity equal to half (rounded down) that of the normal visibility penalty.\n  -  Any applied immobilization penalties that normally fade over time take twice as long to fade.\n  -  All Mokuton techniques add CHA/10, rather than DEX/10, to your Accuracy, if this would be preferable.\n  -  The Upkeep of Mokuton techniques is reduced by CHA/30, to a minimum of half its original value.\n  -  The Chakra Exhaustion penalties incurred by using Mokuton techniques are reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.\n  -  Mokuton is weak to Raiton, but strong against Doton and Katon.\n\n<img \n  src='https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/8/8d/Senju_Symbol.svg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20090302032847' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n##### --( Moku Bunshin no Jutsu - Wood Clone Technique )--\nThis technique takes advantage of mokuton's ability to accelerate plant growth by converting some of the user's cells into, essentially, plant matter; the wood clone physically buds off the user before taking on their appearance.\n  -  Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Cost: 1 Willpower per clone\n  -  Speed: 10, +3 per clone\nEffects:\nWood clones follow most normal rules for clones, but have (CHA)*2 HP, and your attributes. They do not suffer wounds and you may only ever have up to three at once in existance. They may perform any action you normally could, by spending 1 AP per 2 Speed of that action; however, after reaching Fatigue 2 they decay into lifeless wood pulp and fall apart. Wood clones may not take actions with a chakra or stamina cost greater than 20+(your RES for taijutsu, or CHA for ninjutsu)/10.\n\nWood clones have your mind, and can act independently. You are aware of their location, and they yours, though your senses are not linked. You may reabsorb a 'living' wood clone by touching it, in which case you 'download' all its memories.\n\nWhen Wood Clones attack, their actions are always considered to be Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5, even if you do not have the Hold Back ability. This means they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category.\n\\page\n\n\n\n##### --( Mokuton: Shichuurou no Jutsu - Wood Release: Four Pillars Prison Technique )--\nAfter completing the handseals, you place your hands on the ground and channel your chakra beneath your target, where it bursts from the ground as timbers which grow rapidly and form a wooden, usually cubic, prism. The timbers used in this technique are heavily infused with chakra, making them very resilient.\n  -  Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Range: 30\n  -  Area: Up to 20 yard x 20 yard x 20 yard cube\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\nEffects:\nThis is the Mokuton 'version' of the Water Prison and/or Water Drowning techniques, which cannot be directly converted into Mokuton themselves.\n\nIt creates a wooden cage around anyone who can't escape its area, which has 200+(damage bonus)*10 HP, and reduces all damage it takes by your CHA. People inside cannot attack people outside, and vice versa.\n\n\n##### --( Mokuton: Jukai Koutan - Wood Release: Nativity of a Sea of Trees )--\nThis technique uses chakra to cause trees and tree roots to grow rapidly, bursting from any surface. It's too unrefined to be used as a direct method of offense, but can be useful for altering the landscape of a battlefield.\n  -  Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 5 + X\n  -  Range: (Damage bonus)*5\n  -  Area: X\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\nEffects:\nThis overwrites any terrain-based effects on the area it's used on. By changing the cost to 5 + X*2, it can be used to create a one-story building. The complexity of this building is determined by your Chakra Control.\n\nAt 10 Chakra Control or less, it's more like a crude bundle of tree trunks and branches that will at least keep most of the rain out. From 11 - 20, it's about as well-built as a log cabin, with up to three rooms. At 21 - 30, it could actually pass for a real building, aside from the lack of anything made of metal. At 31+ Chakra Control, you can add a second story to the building.\n\n```\n```\n\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/1/1e/Great_Forest_Technique.png/revision/latest?cb=20150312113626' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \n  \\page\n#### Uchiha\nThe Uchiha clan once had a proud history, as one of the greatest shinobi clans the world knew before the advent of ninja villages. Unfortunately, by the present the only widely-known aspect of their heritage is that they produced three of the greatest traitors in ninja history: Uchiha Madara, Itachi, and Sasuke.\n<Br>\nPerhaps it's for the best, then, that the clan was effectively eradicated a hundred years ago--most of the stigma was left behind, buried with their corpses.\n\n<Br>\n\nKonoha has spared no effort in trying to revive the Uchiha clan, and has been, surprisingly, successful. Special Jounin were assigned the sole task of tracking down people with Uchiha ancestry--second cousins, someone whose grandfather had married out of the clan, illegitimate children--and encouraging them to reproduce with one another; either through marriage, or emotionless affairs.\n\n<br>\n\nIt worked, though it took a few generations. Any child who manifested the Sharingan was offered the Uchiha name, along with their entire immediate family. These new Uchiha were encouraged to take pride in their bloodline, and in the fact that they were resurrecting it. The village offered a multitude of incentives, did its best to discourage the stigma of shinobi who were essentially volunteering to be breeding stock, and even constructed the budding clan its own compound--not to isolate them, but to help them feel special. Despite some muttered protests throughout the village, they were even reinstated as one of Konoha's four noble clans.\n\n<Br>\n\nSome shinobi are resentful of the perceived special treatment the Uchiha receive; others take it in stride, accepting that it's in the village's best interest to revitalize one of its most powerful bloodlines. Admittedly, the Uchiha clan--now almost large enough to actually be considered one, though most of its members haven't, and never will, manifested its traits--has yet to live up to its legendary prowess; it's claimed that in the past, all an Uchiha had to do was make eye contact to force a foe to commit suicide. Whether or not they ever shall reclaim their feared and honored status remains to be seen.\n\n<Br>\n\nOutside of their normal training, all members of the Uchiha clan are taught how to use Katon ninjutsu while growing up. Accordingly, they start with the Elemental Aptitude ability for Fire.\n\n##### Uchiha begin with 1 less Unique Point.\n\n\n#### --( Abilities )--\n\n##### -=[ Sharingan - Copy Wheel Eye ]=-\nThe sharingan is a doujutsu, or 'eye technique'; when it manifests, the user's irises turn red, and a tomoe (essentially a comma-shaped mark) appears in the iris, like a second pupil. Another tomoe appears in each eye at the second, and then third stages, for a maximum of three.\n\n<Br>\n\n<img \n  src='https://res.cloudinary.com/teepublic/image/private/s--4jzx312c--/t_Preview/b_rgb:191919,c_limit,f_jpg,h_630,q_90,w_630/v1446235336/production/designs/251253_3.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\nThe Sharingan's greatest disadvantage is that it is dependant upon one's unimpeded visibility. None of the abilities provided by it may be used when you're at a visibility penalty of -6 or greater (Mistborn cannot help you in this regard).\n<Br>\n\n\n\nUnfortunately for the Uchiha, they are not inherently able to access this power. In times of need--generally when under severe combat-related stress--the doujutsu will activate itself. This is GM-regulated; you'll be informed if this takes place. When it does, your Sharingan immediately activates at the stage above the highest you've achieved, and from then on you may activate that stage at will.\n<Br>\n\nHowever, once a shinobi is talented enough, they'll be able to activate their Sharingan's higher stages for the first time without need for that external stimulus. At 500, 1000, and 1500 XP you automatically gain access the First, Second, and Third Stage Sharingan, respectively, if you haven't already. Legends speaks of a fourth stage, though no one in recent memory has obtained it.\n\n\n\\page\n\n\n\n##### -=[ Sharingan, Stage 1 ]=-\nMaintaining the Sharingan active is almost trivially easy, a mere Upkeep 2 effect. Activating it is a Speed 0 action, which can be performed alongside another technique or Interrupt.\n<Br>\n\nAt the first stage, you are able to acquire the Dousatsugan and Saimingan techniques. Both are learned as D-rank jutsu, though have no skill or rank requirements. You may choose to purchase these as soon as you unlock Stage 1, even if you don't have enough XP to do so--in which case you are, essentially, in 'XP debt' until you have enough.\n\n\n##### -=[ Sharingan, Stage 2 ]=-\nThe Sharingan's second stage adds a second tomoe to each eye, and is when the bulk of the doujutsu's power begins to manifest. Their ability to copy techniques and actions becomes refined, to the level of being able to extrapolate from fine details and mimic even small mannerisms.\n<Br>\n\nYou may obtain Yogengan and Shouningan. They are learned as if they're C-rank techniques, though again, have no skill or rank requirements to learn. You may choose to purchase them as soon as you unlock Stage 2, going into XP debt if necessary.\n\n\n##### -=[ Sharingan, Stage 3 ]=-\nThe third tomoe appears, with the three marks forming a ring halfway between the pupil and the rim of the iris, equidistant from one another. Upon reaching this stage, you can copy any genjutsu used upon you by another Uchiha with their Eye of Hypnotism power, despite its lack of handseals (again, assuming you meet the proper requirements). You may also learn Magen: Kyouten Chiten and Senchigan. They're treated as B-rank techniques, you know the rest by now.\n<Br>\n\n\n##### -=[ Dousatsugan - Eye of Insight ]=-\n  -  Requires: Stage 1 Sharingan\nYou can see the flow of chakra. This gives you a +4 bonus to defense rolls against genjutsu. More impressively, it allows you to copy any taijutsu technique you witness being performed, along with any ninjutsu or genjutsu which use handseals.\n<Br>\n\nThis technique's greatest limitation is its user. You must meet all skill requirements for the technique, and can't copy elemental ninjutsu you don't have the appropriate Elemental Aptitude for; Sealing and Medical techniques both require access to those types of jutsu in order for you to copy them.\n<Br>\n\nThis does have one advantage over learning techniques the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; way: you can copy techniques one rank above what you could normally learn (which may vary by category).\n<Br>\n\nYou automatically learn any valid techniques you see, and can use them for the remainder of the day. To keep them permanently, you must pay half the normal XP cost to learn the technique in question. You may go into 'XP debt' learning techniques this way.\n<Br>\n\nYou may not copy custom or clan jutsu, as those are tailored too specifically to either the individual or the clan in question.\n\n\n\n\n##### -=[ Saimingan - Eye of Hypnotism ]=-\n<Br>\n\n  -  Requires: Stage 1 Sharingan\nYou may perform genjutsu without handseals; however, this requires direct eye contact, meaning it can't be used from hiding, must be targeting a person (rather than an area), and can be avoided entirely if they simply shut their eyes (which brings its own penalties) or never look directly at your eyes (which can be done by just, say, staring at your, or their, feet, and affects them with a -4 visibility penalty).\n\n\n##### -=[ Yogengan - Eye of Prediction ]=-\n<Br>\n\n  -  Requires: Stage 2 Sharingan\nOnce per Fatigue category, you may declare use of this technique. It allows you to &quot;take 10&quot; on any defensive roll; rather than rolling 1d20, you treat it as if your result had been a 10.\n<Br>\n\nYou may also declare your action as 'Observe', a variable-speed action similar to blocking, in that for its duration, when attacked you may choose to activate Yogengan against any attack directed against you (and not have it count as your one use for that Fatigue category).\n\n\n##### -=[ Shouningan - Eye of Recognition ]=-\n<Br>\n\n  -  Requires: Stage 2 Sharingan\nFor starters, you can read lips. This is not some kind of ultra undetectable super-long-range spying technique; you have to actually have a clear view of the person's lips, and it's sorta conspicuous; though you can make an opposed Espionage roll to avoid them noticing, if you're trying to hide the fact that you're staring at their face.\n<Br>\n\nYou can also copy a person's handwriting just by seeing them write a single sentence. You can speed-read, and have a photographic memory. This has other uses, such as being able to tell how to pick a given lock by watching one person do it, or how to open a combination lock (though not necessarily the combination itself) by watching the movements of someone's arms or hands as they do it.\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### -=[ Magen: Kyouten Chiten - Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change ]=-\nA form of illusion reversal, in which a Sharingan user instantly and simultaneously sees through and decrypts a genjutsu technique, and then instantly reflects it upon its original user. Some Uchiha will go so far as to claim that this technique makes them immune to genjutsu, and they're... not too far from the truth.\n  -  Type: Genjutsu\n  -  Speed: 6, Special\n  -  Requires: Stage 3 Sharingan\nEffects:\nThis may be used immediately after passing a defensive roll against a genjutsu targeting you. You immediately perform that genjutsu on its original user (paying its normal chakra cost) via your Eye of Hypnotism, using your defensive roll's result as its new Accuracy. This adds 6 to the initiative count on which you next act, as if it was an interrupt. This can only be used on genjutsu which you know (though copying them as they're performed, and then reflecting them, is fair game).\n\n\n##### -=[ Senchigan - Eye of Foresight ]=-\n  -  Requires: Stage 3 Sharingan\nIt was once claimed, and rarely still is, that the Sharingan genuinely allows its wielder to see the future. What it actually does is pick up on minute changes in an opponent's posture, minor eye movements, slight shifts of their weight, muscles tensing or relaxing in preparation for movement, even chakra building up in preparation for a jutsu.\n\nWhen you declare the use of this ability, declare a category of technique (such as Weapon Taijutsu, Katon, or Combo Taijutsu) and a Speed. Your opponent then declares and rolls (if applicable) their defense. Any Interrupt may be used that's valid against your declared Speed.\n\nAfter seeing this result, you may choose to use any technique of the declared type, with Speed equal to or lesser than your declared Speed. Its damage is based on its normal Speed, but its ability to be Interrupted, and when you take your next action, are based on the declared Speed. Any technique used this way has its Stamina or Chakra cost(s) increased by 4.\n\nIf you choose to use a technique against which their reaction is invalid (such as performing Doton: Domu after they had rolled a 20 on their Suiton: Sujinheki), they do not have to pay the chakra costs or Speed of their Interrupt. On the other hand, using a technique that somehow bypasses their defense (such as Earthen Skewer against Kazekame Kaigara no Jutsu) is fair game.\n\n```\n```\n<img \n  src='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xBVMLRoyJPNT-ZXg5mnWkCtVxUFCOkpzj9Cvv1xfOl_dbbAgndVAmvTn_77G7fbOOgMcU7Se7o1RQ9coD7egfu_560cFhljcCjM4Fl0Qq4JMFZ9oUS8PH-fc' \n  style='width:325px' />\nPictured: Wireless Emo PnP Eye.\n\n\\page\n## Yamanaka\n<BR>\n\nA fairly small clan within Leaf, the Yamanaka are highly prized by Leaf's reconnaissance and investigative divisions. In part, this is due to the disproportionate number of Yamanaka who wind up being chakra sensor shinobi.\n<BR>\n\nThe Yamanaka have developed a specialize type of ninjutsu allowing them to directly affect the minds of others, including seizing control of another person's body. A disproportionate number of Yamanaka are also chakra sensors, though it's still a minority of them.\n<BR>\n\nMembers of the Yamanaka clan enjoy close relations with their Nara and Akimichi contemporaries. There is even a monument in Konoha dedicated to the alliance between the three clans. To this day, no foe or circumstance has managed to even strain that bond.\n<BR>\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n<BR>\n\n##### --( Sasayaki Kantoku no Jutsu - Whispering Oversight Technique )--\nActually a fairly recent derivative of the Yamanaka techniques, this was developed because their secret techniques, despite their seemingly subtle nature, are quite over and obtrusive to anyone under their effects. This technique allows the user to see through the eyes of their target; as it lacks any visual cues, victims are typically left completely unaware it's been used.\n  -  Type: Genjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Range: 50\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\nEffects:\nYou use all of the target's senses instead of your own. You are, far all intents and purposes, hitching a ride inside their body. This does not break Yamanaka Clan Telepathy, but you cannot use it (or any other technique) while maintaining Whispering Oversight. Your body is helpless, but you're aware if it's disturbed (shaken, stabbed, and so forth).\n<BR>\n```\n```\n\n<img \n  src='https://i.warosu.org/data/tg/img/0422/93/1441404942837.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n\n##### --( Yamanaka Clan Telepathy )--\nOne of the subtlest techniques possessed by the Yamanaka clan is also one of the ones most valued by their village. This allows instantaneous telepathic communication between a group of individuals, a feat which has virtually limitless tactical applications.\n\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 4\n\nEffects:<Br>\nThis requires you to touch a person's head. Once activated, they are part of your telepathic network; all people who you've brought in can talk to you, and one another, mentally. You can have up to CHA/20 people linked this way, not counting yourself.\n<BR>\n\nYou can remove someone from this link, and they can remove themselves, at will. It has a maximum range of CHA*10 yards.\n<BR>\n\nIf two Yamanaka link, their limits of people are combined, though each Yamanaka counts as one person towards the total limit. The distance limits are also pooled; as long as someone is within range of any of the linked Yamanaka, they can remain part of the network.\n\n\\page\n\n\n\n##### --( Shintenshin no Jutsu - Mind Body Switch Technique )--\nThe signature ability of the Yamanaka clan, this jutsu allows a Yamanaka to send her mind into a target's body, seizing control and keeping the victim, essentially, along for the ride. They're aware of what's going on, but unable to take any sort of action.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Range: 30\n  -  Upkeep: 5\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 8\nEffects:\nIf this hits, you gain control of the target's body. Their body uses their attributes and abilities, but you retain your skills. You may use any jutsu you know; however, elemental ninjutsu require the body to also be able to use that element. You use the victim's elemental affinity, rather than your own.\n<BR>\n\nDuring this time, your own body is helpless; it appears to be asleep, and cannot be woken up by any means. You are aware of any injuries your body sustains, but not its surroundings or condition otherwise.\n<BR>\n\nWhen the body you're possessing takes damage, your body takes the same amount of damage.  You receive any Wounds they suffer (but not Wounds for your own Vitality or HP being depleted by this). When you return to your body, your Fatigue increases by as many levels as theirs did.\n<BR>\n\nSomeone possessed by this technique has several options for trying to escape. Whenever they are Wounded or advance a Fatigue level, they are allowed a 1d20+CHA/5 roll, vs. your 1d20+CHA/5+5. They may also spend a point of Willpower to get one such roll at any point. For each roll they've made previously in the battle, they have a +1 bonus.\n<BR>\n\nYou do not need to meet the normal skill or rank requirements for this technique. If you miss, you suffer a Stun 25, but are not helpless; you're still in control of your body, but disoriented.\n\n<BR>\n\n##### --( Shinranshin no Jutsu - Mind Body Disturbance Technique )--\nA more potent variation of the Yamanaka's mind body switch technique, this allows the Yamanaka to seize control of a victim's body without abandoning their own. The control's not complete--a possessed victim can still talk, shout a warning, and so forth, but they can't control their actions beyond that.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Upkeep: 12\n  -  Range: 20\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\nEffects:<BR>\n\nYou gain control of the victim's body. So long as this is in effect, they cannot take any actions other than those you dictate. Unlike Shintenshin, this does not have any feedback effects; the victim could be killed, and you would be unharmed.\n<BR>\n\nWhatever action you force them to take has its normal Speed for them, and costs you 1 AP per 2 Speed of the action. You may allow them to choose their own defenses (in which case you do not pay AP for them) or dictate which defensive actions they take (in which case you do).\n<BR>\n\nLike Shintenshin, the roll to avoid these effects is 1d20+CHA/5, vs. your 1d20+CHA/5+5. However, they get a cumulative +2 bonus for each roll made. The triggers remain the same. However, if you force them to not defend against an attack, or force them to take an invalid defense (one which will not in any way protect them from the attack, such as blocking a move which does not have its damage reduced by blocking) they immediately get a roll to break the effect (before the attack/defense is resolved), with a +10 bonus.\n<BR>\n\n\n##### --( Shinten Bunshin no Jutsu - Mind Clone Switch Technique )--\nThe final derivative of Shintenshin no Jutsu, this allows the user to transfer their consciousness into multiple targets and gain complete control over them. Beyond the obvious tactical advantages, this allows for unprecedented coordination between the two bodies, as they share a single mind.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank A\n  -  Chakra: 45 + 5 * X\n  -  Upkeep: 5 + 2 * X\n  -  Range: 35\n  -  Speed: 25 + 5 * X\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n<BR>\n\nEffects:<BR>\n\nThis functions as Shintenshin no Jutsu, but you may target a total of X people, up to a maximum of (CHA)/40. You receive damage, Fatigue, and Wounds carryover from all victims.\n\n\n\\page\n\n## Sunakagure No Sato\n\n<img \n  src='http://i54.tinypic.com/ckb2h.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\nLocated in the eastern part of Wind Country, Sunagakure no Sato has a stable, hot climate accented by very cold nights. The village is surrounded by a partial caldera of sandstone and rock on three sides, with a massive stone wall blocking the fourth, allowing one narrow opening into the village. This opening is always guarded by highly trained shinobi, making the village nearly inaccessible. The entire village of Sunagakure is modeled around a giant compass, with main roads reaching out from the village center in all eight directions. Suna buildings are round in shape, and made of red adobe. This allows for sand to blow around the buildings during storms, and for easy, cheap repairs afterward. Because there is no room to expand outward in Suna, they build upward, connecting these adobe skyscrapers with enclosed pathways high above the narrow streets. \n<BR>\n\nSunagakure was built on the backs of nomads who banded together to seek refuge from Wind Country's harsh deserts. Of these nomads, the famous clans of Suna were cultivated out of raw and untamed power. The people of Suna, and similarly from all of Wind Country, have learned to cope with these harsh climates - nearly unbearably hot days, freezing nights, and violent wind storms. \n<Br>\n\nMuch like how the village was founded, during the recovery after the Fourth Great War, desert nomads flocked to Sunagakure for protection. With no room inside the village, they built up small camps outside. Initially these camps were temporary, but after several generations were born here the land outside Sunagakure became home. With so little room, Sunagakure has had little choice but to build deep into the walls of the caldera they depend on for protection to make room. Progress has been slow, but steady. In time the nomadic camps and semi-temporary buildings outside of Sunagakure will be only a vague memory.\n\n<Br>\n\nSuna Shinobi begin in the academy later than Kiri or Konoha, and graduate later than Konoha. Because students typically go into the academy more mentally prepared for the challenges that lie ahead, their overall quality of shinobi at graduation tends to be higher. In Sunagakure quality reigns over quantity, so while they have the least amount of shinobi compared to all Five Great Shinobi villages, their modest numbers are able to complete just as much work. If it weren't for such high quality of shinobi in Sunagakure, they'd not be one of the Five Great Villages. \n\n<Br>\n\n<img \n  src='https://www.ebluejay.com/img/account/b/l/BlueKiss/1/2888fc5_g.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n\nIn the past generation there have been rising tensions with Mist and Stone villages as they have engaged in fierce competition over missions. This has been enflamed by a number of 'incidents' and skirmishes in which shinobi have been lost.\n\n<Br>\n\nRegardless Sand will endure, for we are Forged by the Desert.\n\n\\page\n\n<img \n  src='https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8c/99/14/8c991435f9c6585204552147aca3c274--adventure-movies-rock-johnson.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n### Henzaki\nPossessed of a rare, yet subtle, kekkei genkai, Sunagakure's Henzaki clan is virtually unknown outside of their village. Even within Sand, the most an average person knows about them is that they have some manner of secret technique, body modification, or bloodline which makes them hard to kill.\n<Br>\n\nIt is a bloodline, one which gives them an incredible ability to survive against adversity. Injuries which should be fatal prove only a minor inconvenience to the Henzaki.\n<Br>\nThe Henzaki have few defining characteristics as a clan, though many are swarthy and dark-haired. All are in good physical shape, their metabolisms self-regulating to prevent them from ever becoming over- or underweight. Henzaki virtually never get ill, and never seem to age past their forties.\n<Br>\nA well-known fact among Sunagakure's medic nin is that the Henzaki's bloodline makes them all universal donors and universal recipients, both for blood transfusions and organ transplants.\n\n<Br>\n```\n```\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Homeostasis )--\nHenzaki physiology has an incredible ability to adapt, responding to any changes in its environment or condition, every system function of their body reacting instantly with a single goal: maintaining the stability of their vital functions.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Cost: 20\nEffects:\nYou reduce the Poisons status of poisons by RES/40, and take damage every 2 IC, rather than every IC. If the poison's Poison severity is reduced below half by this, all its other effects on you are negated. Similarly, you reduce the severity of any Bleed statuses by RES/40, and take damage every 10 IC, rather than ever 5.\n<Br>\nBleeding from sources other than the Bleed status (for example, the Critical Piercing Wound 'Punctured Liver') is halved, and has its duration halved; if it does not have a set duration, it stops after 100 IC.\n<Br>\nSuffocation effects do not force you to make Stamina rolls, but still apply normally. Even if you're killed, you won't truly 'die' until reduced to -200% HP; you'll seem dead, all vital signs stopped, but will then revive once you return to 1 HP.\n\n\n##### --( Regeneration )--\nAmong those who've worked alongside Henzaki for any prolonged period of time, this is probably their most envied ability. A Henzaki will heal in minutes from injuries that would take others hours to get over, and in hours will have recovered from wounds that might take days for ordinary people to recover from.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 2\n  -  Scale: 2\n  -  Limit: 1 + RES /30\nEffects:\nYou regenerate 1 point of Vitality per rank each Initiative Count, and twice that amount of HP.\n\nIn a given day, you can only heal (rank) times your maximums of each. Thus, at two ranks in regeneration, if you had 1000 Vitality you could only regenerate 2000 Vitality in a given day.\n\nFinally, you divide the total healing time necessary to recovery from any wound that doesn't involve injured bones by 1+(0.5 * rank). Medical attention cannot reduce it further; however, you can recover as if you had medical attention, even if you do not, thanks to your regeneration.\n\n\\page\n\n\n#####  --( Organ Mobility )--\nThe secret to much of the Henzaki's longevity, and their nigh-immortality, is their ability to control their body's internal structure. If an organ has been punctured, they can force the wound shut or use another organ to put pressure on it. If a compartment in their body is hemorrhaging, they can force the lining to open and let it bleed out to relieve pressure.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 15 + 5 * X\n  -  Speed: 8\nEffects:\nYou immediately recover from any wound which doesn't somehow involve your bones. The wound doesn't actually heal, but your body adapts in some fashion to function despite it. This lasts for 24 hours, -6 hours per category the wound is above Minor.\n<Br>\n\nYou may spend 1 Willpower to use this when you're wounded (as a Speed 0 Interrupt in response to being wounded), in which case the wound is negated entirely--you simply don't suffer it, don't have to recover from it, and so forth.\n<Br>\n\nX is 1 for Minor, 2 for Major, 3 for Severe, and 4 for Critical wounds.\n\n\n##### --( Sanguine Vitality )--\nAs a result of their bloodline, Henzaki blood itself has a number of interesting, medically significant properties. Most relevant to shinobi, it can be rapidly metabolized by virtually anyone, and will induce temporary, rapid regeneration. It still tastes like blood, and since it has to be consumed fresh from the veins, it's not a particularly appetizing prospect.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 3\n  -  Scale: 1\n  -  Limit: 1 + RES /30\nEffects:<Br>\n\nThis require someone to be close and still enough to drink your fresh blood. Generally speaking the Henzaki will cut open their palm or arm and suspend their regeneration, but simply biting them will suffice.\n<Br>\n\nYou can give up up to 1 point of HP (not Vitality) per rank for every 5 IC which pass. Each point of HP restores 5 points of Vitality (not HP) to the recipient. A person cannot die while receiving blood from you.\n<Br>\n\nHowever, if either you or the recipient moves, or is forcibly moved, or takes any other actions, this effect is broken. \n\n\\page\n### Hitori\n\nIt's unknown how the Hitori came to be, despite plentiful speculation on the matter. The first possessor of their advanced chakra nature, Scorch release, was a single person who lived nearly a century and a half ago. Some theorize that centuries of living in the desert and being exposed to its 'natural chakra' may have had a lasting effect on some of the native people.\n<Br>\n\nBattles involving Hitori outside of the desert leave their mark for days, the dry air and parched soil lingering as if they'd brought a little piece of Sunagakure with them.\n<Br>\n\nHitori themselves seem the very opposite of what you might expect from a clan that dries up everything around them, the essence of energy and youth throughout most of their lives. They tend to be very outgoing, with fiery red hair and occasional groups of freckles on their face and arms.\n<Br>\n\nThey tend to train on the outskirts of Sunagakure and frequently function alongside the Juugo Suto for this reason, often posted outside the village proper--the fact that their powers are so inimical to life, even that of other shinobi, may have something to do that.  Unwelcome guests within the Wind Country are usually run off by the Hitori, who use their abilities in a subtle fashion to create living conditions that quickly become unbearable.\n<Br>\n\nThough a relatively new clan within the village, their abilities have earned them prestige and a respected place within its hierarchy, and in some ways they're considered to represent the spirit of the country they live in.\n<Br>\n\n\nHitori begin with Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Wind ninjutsu, along with the first rank of Elemental Affinity: Shakuton, which includes Katon and Fuuton.\n\n##### Hitori begin with 1 less Unique Point.\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Shakuton - Scorch Release )--\n<Br>\nCombining fire and wind chakra results in the advanced nature of 'scorch release'; as the name suggests, it involves using extreme heat as a weapon, with powerful users being able to reduce opponents to ash or evaporate the liquid inside their body.\n\nAny Katon or Fuuton technique may be converted to Shakuton, with the following effects:\n  -   +5 Chakra cost\n  -  Shakuton techniques deal only 80% of their normal damage; however, they cannot be blocked, and have +CHA/30 Accuracy.\n  -  Whenever you hit a target with a Scorch release jutsu, their Dehydration status' severity is increased by (1 per rank of the jutsu) + CHA / (90 - 10 * Rank). In other words, for an E-rank this is 1+CHA/80, for a D-rank it is 2+CHA/70, and so on, up to 5+CHA/40 for A-rank techniques.\n  -  Your techniques can raise a victim's Dehydrate status to a maximum of 3+(CHA)/8.\n  -  All Ignite effects you inflict also add Dehydrate of half the Ignite's severity.\n  -  Shakuton techniques cannot be reduced below Speed 4.\n  -  Shakuton is weak to Suiton, and strong against Fuuton and Raiton.\n\n<img \n  src='https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/powerlisting/images/1/19/Scorch_Release_Mummy.png/revision/latest?cb=20121106015715' \n  style='width:325px' />\n##### --( Dehydration )--\nThis is a status effect. Every point of Dehydration is a -1 penalty to the victim's Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls. Dehydrate stacks fully with itself; Dehydration 3 added to Dehydration 2 makes a single Dehydration 5 status.\n<Br>\n\nAnyone suffering from Dehydration also suffers the effects of Paralysis equal to (Dehydrate's severity)/4. This is not an actual Paralyze status, but a side-effect of the Dehydration; normal effects which interact with Paralysis (such as some Raiton) do not affect it.\n<Br>\n\nUnlike the Burns status, which similarly penalizes Stamina rolls, this status is not cleared when someone fails a Fatigue roll. Instead, its severity is decreased by RES/20 points every 10 minutes OOC (hour IC) out of combat, but only so long as the victim is able to drink plenty of water.\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Evaporate )--\nFocusing your chakra over an area, you can cause water to evaporate. This is a Speed 8 action, and removes X*2 gallons of water from the battlefield, with a Chakra cost of 5+X. The maximum for X is CHA/10.\n\nThis cannot target water used as part of a sustained jutsu (i.e. one with an Upkeep).\n\n\n##### --( Kasou no Jutsu - Cremation Technique )--\nYou focus your chakra on a victim, and simply light them ablaze.\n  -  Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Range: CHA/2\n  -  Speed: 15\nEffects:\nIf this hits, it removes the victim's Dehydrate status and replaces it with an Ignite of equal severity. This does enjoy Shakuton's typical +CHA/30 Accuracy, and does apply a new Dehydrate equal to half the Ignite's severity.\n\n\n##### --( Sabaku no Keshin - Incarnation of Desert )--\nYou project your chakra out across the battlefield, with devastating results. The temperature rises, water begins to evaporate, some plants may start to wilt, and hopefully nothing nearby is particularly combustible.\n  -  Type: Shakuton Ninjutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Range: Ninjutsu damage bonus *10\nEffects:\nEveryone within the range except you has their Dehydrate status increased by 1+(your CHA)/40 when you activate this jutsu, and every 10 IC. This remains centered on you. Every time this effect takes place, (CHA)/10 gallons of water are removed from the battlefield.\n\n\\page\n### Juugo Sato\n<img \n  src='http://vintageninja.net/wp-content/uploads/Octagon-Norris.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\nThe Sand Foxes are not a 'real' clan, in any proper sense, and most members do not have any blood relation to one another. The clan often adopts orphans to raise and train.\n<Br>\n\nWhat they lack in secret or bloodline techniques, the sand foxes make up for in training from a very young age to understand and be aware of the environment. It's by no means cruel or harsh, but it's more than what others go through.\n<Br>\n\nSocially, they function much like any other clan, but have an unusually strong close-knit, even familial bond with one another. The sand foxes look out for their own. Within the village they're respected, and usually return the favor. Many are introverted--at least around people who aren't members of their clan--but few are sullen.\n<Br>\n\nThe Juugo Suto have a well-deserved reputation for being excellent trackers and firmly loyal to their village. Almost every team of shinobi sent to patrol the desert around Hidden Sand has at least one sand fox member, and even outside the Wind Country they frequently serve as scouts.\n\n\n##### Experience Bonus: +5%\n```\n```\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Survival Instinct )--\nMost clans pass on secret techniques as a rite of passage. The Juugo Suto have a somewhat different rite: once a member is ready they are left alone, in the middle of the desert, without provisions or equipment, and told not to return for at least a month; most of them aren't even teenagers. It's a testament to the clan that virtually every student is, in fact, ready to undertake this challenge, and returns safely to the village. It's a testament to the ordeal that they inevitably return from their journey changed: quieter, calmer, and infinitely more aware of the world around them.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Cost: 25\n  -  Effects: You are immune to surprise attacks. Attacks which would normally not end an opponent's stealth still do not do so, but they receive none of the benefits of surprise attacks against you.\n<Br>\n\nSneak attacks against you instead follow the normal rules for surprise attacks.\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Tenacity )--\nDesert is some of the most difficult terrain to navigate, but the sand foxes do it. They adapt to the harsh environment. It's not that it gets any easier, or that they've learned any secret. They just face the obstacles, assess them, accept them, and do what they must regardless.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 5\n  -  Scale: 5\n  -  Limit: 4\n  -  Effects: You reduce the severity of any immobilization and visibility penalties on you by 1, per rank. Each rank also reduces the maximum immobilization penalty you can suffer from by 1.\n\n\n##### --( Desert Ghosts )--\nIn the world of shinobi, there is no such thing as hunter and hunted; one is both, at all times. The juugo suto are preeminently aware of this. That awareness, and their mentality of never taking their safety for granted, has led to no end of frustration for foreign shinobi trying to guage the strength and frequency of Suna's patrols.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 4\n  -  Scale: 2\n  -  Limiting Attribute: DEX /20\n  -  Effects: For every rank you have a +1 bonus to Survival rolls, and anyone attempting to track you has a -1 penalty to their roll. If you are leading a group with a size of your Survival skill or less (including you), you may make a single Survival roll for all members, and anyone trying to track the group receives a -1 penalty per rank to their roll. Multiple Sand Foxes may work together, pooling their Survival skills for the maximum size, and using only the highest roll and penalty.\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Intuition )--\nThere are multiple sayings in Sand about a sand fox's intuition. Some are jokes at their expense, often told by genin. And the clan bears them without comment, because among the jounin those sayings are proverbs.\n\nIt's not, despite what some have speculated, anything supernatural. The juugo suto can't actually watch every leaf in a forest at once, or hear a feather falling. All they can do, and all they need to do, is be calm, and watch, and listen, and know what about a setting is just a little bit wrong.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Cost: 50\n  -  Requires: 20 Awareness, 20 Survival\nEffects:\nAll enemies are treated as being 1 Stealth category lower than they actually are, to you; this mainly applies for reducing their Stealth bonus when you're looking for them.\n\nThis does allow you to attack an enemy in Stealth 1, though you may do so only with ranged attacks, and then at a -3 penalty to Accuracy--you're going by intuition, and essentially firing blind. Area-of-effect attacks do not suffer from this Accuracy penalty. Similarly, you are inherently aware of the presence (though not location) of anyone only in Stealth 1--they can't sneak up on you.\n\n\\page\n### Kairaishi\n\nNot actually a clan at all, Kairaishi is a term reserved for those in Suna who embrace a specific method of fighting: manipulation of weaponized puppets.\n\nLearning to do so takes years of training, and with the exception of a handful of geniuses every few generations takes up almost all of one's free time during their academy years. Most puppeteers learn everything they know being mentored by a master of the art, who will typically take only one student at a time.\n\nOne of the greatest assets of puppeteers is their ability to essentially multiply their forces on the battlefield. A skilled puppeteer can control several human-sized puppets at once, potentially tipping the numbers in their side's favor.\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Kugutsu no Jutsu - Puppet Technique )-- ***\nThe Kairaishi's signature technique and a unique ninjutsu, this allows the user to extend strands of chakra from their body and attach them to puppets.  Using the puppets, they can attack and manipulate them from range while remaining relatively safe themselves.  The better the user's control over their chakra, the better they can control puppets by the strands connecting them.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X\n  -  Upkeep: 2 + X\n  -  Speed: 1 + X/2 (round down)\n<Br>\n\nEffects:<Br>\n\nYou gain control of 1 + X puppets which are uncontrolled on the battlefield. At all times, one of these puppets is designated as your primary puppet. You choose this at the start of any combat, and may change your primary puppet by spending 10 AP. Many techniques use this puppet as the main source of your attacks or defenses, your other puppets supporting it, just adding a bonus to your attack. If they were puppets which you haven't worked on (i.e. someone else's) have a -3 penalty to all actions with them. While controlling puppets, your hands are not free for handseals, using weapons, or so forth. By default (i.e. without any ranks in Puppet Mastery, below) you may only control 1 puppet at a time. You do not have to keep track of puppet IC.\n<Br>\n\nWhile maintaining this technique's Upkeep you may take the following actions.\n<Br>\n\nControl Puppets: Attack Formation (Speed Variable, AP X)<Br>\n\n1 + X puppets will attack, using whatever the primary puppet is equipped with to decide what you have available. The speed of this technique is the speed of the primary puppet's choice of attack. If you spend AP to AP this down, the puppet's attack is also reduced.  The attack has a +1 bonus for every two puppets in the formation. This may be used to cause your puppet to perform any Taijutsu (Unarmed, Combo, or Grapple) you know, as well any Weapon Taijutsu you know which they have the proper weapon for. Doing this requires you to pay a Chakra cost equal to that technique's Stamina cost.\n<Br>\n\nControl Puppets: Defensive Formation (Speed Variable, AP X, Interrupt)<Br>\n\n1 + X puppets will move to protect you. You may choose any defense the primary puppet is equipped to do. The speed of this is based on the speed of the defense used.  If you spend AP to AP this down, the puppet's defense is also reduced.The defense has a +1 bonus for every two puppets in the formation.\n<Br>\n\nControl Puppets: Dodge (Speed 2 + X / 2, Interrupt, AP 1 + X / 2)<Br>\n\nUp to 1 + X puppets dodge a technique. This may be used alongside the user defending themselves (You may dodge too!).\n<Br>\n\nControl Puppets: Prepare (Speed 5)<Br>\n\nYou prepare yourself to do something involving your puppets. This generates 5 AP, which does count towards your maximum but may only be used in actions taken with Kugutsu no Jutsu.\n<Br>\n\nControl Puppets: Move (Speed Variable)<Br>\n\nYou may move any number of puppets at once, using no AP. Every 1 AP you do choose to spend increases the Speed of their move action (but not this action, for you) by 2.\n<Br>\n\\page\n\n\n\n##### --( Puppet Mastery )--\nA novice puppet master needs both hands to direct the motions of a single puppet, often using a finger for each joint or something similar. A master learns how to split their chakra threads, and with as little as the twitching of a single digit and modulating of their chakra flows gracefully direct their puppets.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Limit: XP /500, max 9\n<Br>\n\nEffects:<Br>\n\nYou may control 1 additional puppet at a time with Kugutsu no Jutsu for each rank in this ability, up to a maximum of 10 (one per finger) with all 9 ranks.\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Kugutsu Henge no Jutsu - Puppet Transformation Technique )--\nWith this technique you can channel chakra through your puppet to give it your own appearance. This is typically done in conjunction with an actual disguise put on the puppet in case the technique fails, as it suffers from the same limitations at normal Henge.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 5\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 6\n\nEffects:<Br>\n\nYou disguise your puppet to look like you.  This has all the limitations of normal Henge, but without any worry of a false impersonation:  You know how you look and act to mimic yourself perfectly.  Consequently, you have a +5 to your Espionage roll against people figuring out your puppet isn't you.\n<Br>\n\nAnything that detects normal Henge will also detect this technique, and if the puppet takes damage the technique ends immediately.\n<Br>\n\n\n##### ---( Kugutsu Kuchiyose no Jutsu - Puppet Summoning Technique )--\nMost puppeteers don't carry all of their puppets out at once to give themselves a tactical advantage, instead using this technique to keep them stored in scrolls, to be summoned in battle when needed.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 5 + X*2 per puppet\n  -  Speed:  5 + X*2 per puppet\n  -  Seal Speed: 6\n<Br>\n\nEffects:<Br>\n\nYou summon X amount of puppets you've stored in scrolls ahead of time, which you can then use.\n```\n```\n\n\n\n##### --( Souen: Hitomu Gokuu - Puppet Performance: Skillful Achievement with a Human Body )--\nA technique developed amidst the First Shinobi War, this jutsu became highly regarded by puppet master's allies and enemies, as it allows them to continue fighting even after their puppets have been destroyed, gaining a new ally with every enemy defeated.\n<Br>\n\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank A\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n  -  Range: 20\n\nEffects:<Br>\n\nYou gain control of a corpse on the battlefield.  If the body has more than 3 Major Wounds, 2 Severe Wounds, or 1 Critical Wound, it is too badly decimated to be of use and can't be used with this jutsu.\n<Br>\n\nThe body functions exactly like a normal puppet would, using your CHA in place of their STR, and your DEX in place of its DEX and AGI.  Unlike normal puppets, you use the body's normal HP amount to determine Wounds, and once it has received too many wounds, the body is considered destroyed and no longer usable.\n<Br>\n\nAlternatively, you can connect your Chakra Strands to that of a willing target to empower them.  While you are connected, you suffer from an Upkeep 15, and the following effects occur:\n<Br>\n\n  -  The target uses the higher of yours or their bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls (not taking into account the penalty from this move's upkeep).\n  -  The target can choose to use your chakra instead of theirs, in which case you take the any effects (chakra penalties or lowered fatigue) as a result of chakra exhaustion rolls, instead of them.\n  -  The target has access to all jutsu you know, and can use any elemental jutsu that they or you has the appropriate aptitude for.\n  -  The target can use theirs or your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus, whichever is higher.\n<Br>\n\nBoth the target can you can end the upkeep at any point you wish, severing the connection.  Any techniques which were dependent on the connection (like a Doton upkeep move, while the target doesn't have aptitude for Doton) immediately end.\n<Br>\n\nAnything that can target and destroy chakra threads can also do so to disrupt this technique. While maintaining this technique in either form you cannot control puppets.\n<Br>\n\n\\page\n\n\n#### -=[ Puppets ]=-\n<Br>\n\nThe weapon of choice of puppeteers, these range from the size of a small human to that of a large animal. There are no 'standard-issue' puppets, though the village does have a stockpile of old and unused ones which can be borrowed. Puppets are usually custom-built by their user or inherited and modified from that person's mentor.\n<Br>\n\nYou have XP/50 Puppet Points (PP). All parts have a cost in PP (admittedly, some as low as 0); the total of all parts used iin any single puppet can go up to your max PP. This is not actually a resource, per se, but a measurement of skill.\n<Br>\n\nWithin your limits, you purchase parts using Requisition or Savings. Swapping out parts on any number of puppets can be accomplished with a single day of downtime back in the village; once you leave on a mission, you're stuck with what you've got.<Br>\n\n\nIn the village, puppets can be repaired between scenes. When on a mission it takes an IC hour of dedicated work to restore 10% of the HP of a single puppet, due to lacking the proper tools and resources.\n<Br>\n\nPuppets are immune to genjutsu and all status effects other than immobilize and ignite. They take only half damage from ignite. Since you are controlling them, your visibility penalties apply; other status penalties on you do not.\n<Br>\n\nPuppets use your CHA in place of their STR, and your DEX in place of their AGI and DEX. They do not have RES or CHA. They can move (As detailed above) but cannot move more than your CHA in yards from your. Otherwise, puppets receive all your bonuses to accuracy and rolls, such as from abilities and uniques.\n<Br>\n\nFinally, puppets are complicated pieces of equipment. Their biggest weaknesses are their joints and other moving parts. If a puppet is suffering from an immobilization penalty of 6 or higher, it cannot act or be used with any part of Kugutsu no Jutsu.The most basic, and expensive part of the puppet. The frame of a puppet is constructed from chakra-conducive wood, and all the puppets' various parts are anchored to it.\n<Br>\n\nFrames are divided into several general categories, described below. Each frame has a PP capacity for action location, for example &quot;Head: 3 PP&quot;. This means that you can fit up to 3 PP worth of upgrades in that location, if you're using that frame.\n<Br>\n\nBy default, a frame can accommodate one torso, one head, two arms, and one pair of legs. Each arm has its own, separate PP capacity, but legs are outfitted as a pair.\n<Br>\n\nWhile you can pay for these parts using Requisition or Savings, be aware that once you've bought something with Savings you cannot return it for a refund. You can still upgrade it, but not remove existing upgrades.\n<Br>\n\nNote: Additional legs increase movement speed by 25% per pair. Every two additional arms gives a +3 bonus to any roll based on STR, including grapples.  Despite the fact legs and arms come in pairs, cosmetically there could be more or less; a centipede puppet might be described as having dozens of legs, even if it only actually had three pairs.\n<Br>\n\n<img \n  src='https://i.pinimg.com/564x/af/8c/82/af8c82c931226bb4d478bdcfb64045a5.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\\page\n\n#### Frames\n\n   Small<Br>\n\nRanging in size from a medium-sized dog to a human child, these frames have the advantage of not requiring a lot of material and being reasonably forgiving in construction.<Br>\n\n\nUnfortunately, this also means they're easily destroyed.<Br>\n\n HP: 200<Br>\n\n   Head: 3 PP<Br>\n\n   Torso: 3 PP<Br>\n\n   Arms: 2 PP each<Br>\n\n   Legs: 4 PP<Br>\n\n Cost: 100 Ryo<Br>\n\nSpecial: You may exchange two arms for a second pair of legs, but not vice versa. The puppet has a +2 bonus to Stealth rolls, and +3 to dodge.<Br>\n\n\n\n   Medium:<Br>\n\nGenerally the size of an adult human, these are the most widely-used and adaptable puppets. They have a balance of strength and speed, and can endure longer battles than more delicate models, while also retaining plenty of mobility.<Br>\n\n HP: 400<Br>\n\n Damage Reduction: 10<Br>\n\n   Head: 5 PP<Br>\n\n   Torso: 6 PP<Br>\n\n   Arms: 3 PP each<Br>\n\n   Legs: 6 PP<Br>\n\n Cost: 250 Ryo<Br>\n\nSpecial: Increasing the cost by 100 Ryo allows you to fit on another two arms or one pair of legs.<Br>\n\n\n\n   Recon:<Br>\n\nSomewhere between a small and medium frame, with light but sturdy materials, this frame is optimized for stealth and reconnaissance puppets.<Br>\n\n HP: 250<Br>\n\n   Head: 8 PP<Br>\n\n   Torso: 3 PP<Br>\n\n   Arms: 2 PP each<Br>\n\n   Legs: 4 PP<Br>\n\n Cost: 200 Ryo<Br>\n\nSpecial: +5 Stealth<Br>\n\n\n\n   Reinforced:<Br>\n\nUsing the medium frame as a base, these use stronger and heavier materials, reinforced joints, and armor plates. While these are exceptionally sturdy as a result, it's too compact to allow for the extensive customization most puppeteers enjoy.<Br>\n\n HP: 500<Br>\n\n Damage Reduction: 25<Br>\n\n   Head: 2 PP<Br>\n\n   Torso: 2 PP<Br>\n\n   Arms: 1 PP each<Br>\n\n   Legs: 2 PP<Br>\n\n Cost: 200 Ryo<Br>\n\n\n   Large:<Br>\n\nThe biggest and most expensive puppets, these tend to be build with a specific purpose in mind. They have above-average durability and great storage space, but can be impractical in certain situations. The smallest of these are easier larger than a large person.<Br>\n\n HP: 350<Br>\n\n   Head: 5 PP<Br>\n\n   Torso: 10 PP<Br>\n\n   Arms: 4 PP each<Br>\n\n   Legs: 6 PP<Br>\n\n Cost: 300 Ryo<Br>\n\nSpecial: -5 dodge, -5 stealth, and -2 accuracy. Adding 100 Ryo to the cost allows you to add an extra two arms, or pair of legs. You may spend up to 300 extra Ryo this way.<Br>\n\n\n\n#### -=[ Upgrades ]=-\n<Br>\n\nBelow are upgrades you can apply to your puppet's torso to make it more effective at whatever it is you want its purpose to be. Unless specified otherwise, you can apply these upgrades as many times as you have the PP and money for. Upgrades here do not count towards the PP capacity of any of the puppet's locations.\n\n<Br>\n\n   Armored<Br>\n\nYour puppet is covered with armor plates, or sturdy pieces of wood. This reduces any damage it takes by 5 points, stacking with its existing damage reduction.\n  PP: 1<Br>\n\n  Cost: 50 Ryo<Br>\n\n<Br>\n\n\n   Increased Capacity<Br>\n\nYou can fit more things in your puppet! This increases the PP capacity of a single location by 1.<Br>\n\n  PP: 2<Br>\n\n  Cost: 50 Ryo<Br>\n\n\n<Br>\n\n   Quiet Joints<Br>\n\nYour puppet can move without its components clicking together and causing all sorts of noise. This costs gives a +3 bonus to Stealth. You may take this twice.<Br>\n\n  PP: 2<Br>\n\n  Cost: 50 Ryo<Br>\n\n<Br>\n\n\n   Sturdy<Br>\n\nYour puppet is especially durable. You can spend 1 PP and 25 Ryo to increase its HP by some amount, depending upon its frame size.<Br>\n\nSmall: +50<Br>\n\nMedium: +75<Br>\n\nRecon: +25<Br>\n\nReinforced: +100<Br>\n\nLarge: +75<Br>\n\n\n\\page\n\n\n#### Head\nCamera<Br>\n\nYou install a camera inside your puppet's head! It follows the normal rules for cameras (see Gear, in the Equipment chapter), though its presence is typically not obvious, since it's... you know, inside the puppet's head. You need film for it; see below.<Br>\n\nPP: 3<Br>\n\nCost: 500 Ryo<Br>\n\n\n<Br>\n\n   Film Reel<Br>\n\nYou install a roll of film in your puppet's head. Goes well with the camera! Each 'unit' of film (i.e. one picture) costs 25 Ryo. A single reel can hold up to ten of these. You can install multiple film reels, if you want to be able to take more than ten pictures.<Br>\n\nPP: 1<Br>\n\nCost: 0 - 250 Ryo<Br>\n\n<Br>\n\n\n   Hidden Weapon (Melee):<Br>\n\nYou have a concealed weapon, typically a blade of some sort. This cannot be disarmed, and can be used to attack in grapple. The first time in a battle it's used, it's an automatic surprise attack.<Br>\n\n\nThis weapon is modified to be usable by the puppet; you can't remove it and fight with it yourself. It can be any Small-sized Slashing or Piercing weapon from the Equipment chapter of the PHB; the cost of that weapon is added to the cost of his upgrade.<Br>\n\n  PP: 3<Br>\n\n  Cost: 100 Ryo + Special<Br>\n<Br>\n\n\n\n   Hidden Weapon (Ranged):<Br>\n\nYour puppet has a weapon launcher inside of its head. It can hold up to twenty kunai, shuriken, or senbon, which must be paid for normally. You can purchase this multiple times, each time adding to the capacity getting a separate launcher for a different type of weapon.<Br>\n\n  PP: 1<Br>\n\n  Cost: 25 Ryo + Special<Br>\n\n\n\n   Perception<Br>\n\nBy placing small, chakra-conductive components in the head of the puppet the user can see and hear what the puppet sees and hears. This upgrade can be toggled on and off as a Speed 0 action. While using it, you suffer visibility penalties, and make Awareness checks, based on your puppet's location and 'senses' rather than your own. You can only use this for one puppet at a time.<Br>\n\n  PP: 2<Br>\n\n  Cost: 50 Ryo<Br>\n<Br>\n\n\n\n   Voice Box<Br>\n\nUsing a chakra-based speaker in its head, your puppet can talk! Specifically, it can transmit your voice, or a distorted and unrecognizable version of it.<Br>\n\n  PP: 1<Br>\n\n  Cost: 20 Ryo<Br>\n```\n```\n\n\n  \n  \n#### Torso\nExploding Torso<Br>\n\nBy placing exploding tags in the body of a puppet, the thing is turned into what is essentially a walking bomb. This allows you to store up to (Chakra Control skill ranks)/5 Exploding Tags inside the puppet. You may detonate them as a Speed 10 action while controlling the puppet. The puppet takes double the full damage, anyone inside or grappling it may choose to block (though not dodge). The range is 20 yards, +1 per tag after the first, and the damage is the total damage of all the tags used in this. The accuracy penalty for not being able to escape an AoE, however, is halved. You must pay for the exploding tags separately.<Br>\n\n\nIf a puppet loses all its HP after doing this, it cannot be repaired without returning to a village and rebuilding it entirely.<Br>\n\n  PP: 3 ; it costs an additional 1 PP per tag, which may be taken from any location<Br>\n\n  Cost: 100 + cost of exploding tags<Br>\n\n<Br>\n\n\n   Hollow Body:<Br>\n\nAll puppets are hollow, but this modification creates a spacious, shell-like area inside the torso of the puppet. This is large enough to fit a person and, depending on the design, may have eye holes too look out from. If so, Awareness checks can be made, but at a -4 penalty.<Br>\n\n\nGetting into or out of the puppet is a Speed 8 action; it can be locked from the inside. However, while inside you may not use perform handseals (too cramped), attack or be attacked, or control your other puppets.<Br>\n\n\nA person inside cannot be attacked until the puppet has been destroyed.<Br>\n\n  PP: 8<Br>\n\n  Cost: 150<Br>\n\n\n<Br>\n\n   Reinforced:<Br>\n\nYour puppet is reinforced. No, really. Each application of this increases the puppet's HP by 25.<Br>\n\n  PP: 1<Br>\n\n  Cost: 10<Br>\n<Br>\n\n\n\n   Trap Body<Br>\n\nAn elaborate arrangement of wires and launches inside a hollowed out torso which, when triggered, fire and wrap around a target, then quickly retract to pull them into the puppet to capture them.<Br>\n\nWhen the puppet is attacked in melee, this can be declared in place of a defensive action; it's a Speed 10 Interrupt, which costs 5 AP to use (via Chakra Threads). The puppet takes half damage from the attack, and the attacker must then defend against this attack.<Br>\n\n\nIf they fail, they are trapped and locked inside the puppet's Hollow Body; Trap Bodies lock (automatically) from the outside, and cannot be opened from the inside without destroying the puppet. The person inside is limited to basic unarmed attacks against the puppet while inside. This can only be deployed once per battle, after which it needs to be reset.<Br>\n\n  PP: 4<Br>\n\n  Cost: 200 Ryo<Br>\n\\page\n\n\n  \n#### Arms\nChakra Shield:<Br>\n\nInstalled in an arm, these deploy by unfolding umbrella-like wooden spokes and briefly projecting a temporarily solidified shield of chakra. This is a Speed 5 Interrupt, and costs 3 AP to use, if used to defend the puppet, it's used alongside a Control Puppets: Dodge, and instead of adding Speed it just costs 5 AP.<Br>\n\n\nThe shield will block up to CHA*5 damage. If this stops an attack entirely, subtract half that attack's damage from CHA*5; that's how much 'HP' the shield has remaining for future uses. If an attack does more damage than the shield's HP the puppet takes any carryover, and the shield is unusable for the rest of the battle.<Br>\n\n\nEven if this blocks all damage from a technique, it will not stop any other effects (such as immobilization or ignite).<Br>\n\n  PP: 3<Br>\n\n  Cost: 50 Ryo<Br>\n<Br>\n\n\n\n   Equipped Weapon<Br>\n\nYour puppet has a weapon it can use in its arm. This can be any weapon with a Stamina cost of 10 or less; you may increase the maximum Stamina cost by 5, by increasing the PP cost by 1. The puppet increases an Accuracy bonuses on the weapon, and and penalties by 2. It may dual-wield only (Dual) weapons, and those only at your level of the Dual Wielding ability. You must pay for the weapon used.<Br>\n\n\nTo use a two-handed weapon, this must be purchased for both arms which will be using that weapon. The cost of the weapon itself only has to be paid for once.<Br>\n\n   PP: 1 - 4<Br>\n\n   Cost: 50 RYo + Weapon's cost<Br>\n<Br>\n\n\n\n   Flamethrower:<Br>\n\nA contraption which sprays a mist or stream of some combustible substance and ignites it with chakra on contact with oxygen. This enables the puppet to, as the name suggests, project powerful gouts of flame.<Br>\n\n\nThis is a Speed 14 action for the puppet. In addition to doing (CHA/8)d10 damage, this inflicts Burns 6 and Ignite 5 if the target fails a status roll, using your Chakra Control.<Br>\n\n  PP: 1 for the mechanism, 1 per 2 uses<Br>\n\n  Cost: 50 for the mechanism, 25 per 2 uses<Br>\n<Br>\n\n\n\n   Glider:<Br>\n\nSpecial, folding wings installed inside the arms of your puppet, this can extend and retract as necessary. To be useful you must install this upgrade in both arms of a pair. This upgrade halve the puppet's physical damage with those arms.<Br>\n\n\nThe puppet can fly. An airborne puppet may not carry people (via Hollow Body). A flying puppet is immune to any effects reliant upon contact with the ground (such as some immobilization penalties) and cannot be targeted by melee-range techniques unless it made a melee-range attack in the past 25 IC.<Br>\n\n  PP: 2<Br>\n\n  Cost: 150 Ryo<Br>\n<Br>\n\n```\n```\n\n\n\n   Grapple Arm<Br>\n\nYour puppet can fire off its hand, with a rope attaching it back to the arm. This allows your puppet to initiate a Grapple at a distance as a Speed 10 action. From there it can, as a separate Speed 6 action, draw itself to the person in question. From there it may perform any Grapple jutsu you know when you make it attack.<Br>\n\n  PP: 2<Br>\n\n  Cost: 75 Ryo<Br>\n\n<Br>\n\n\n   Hidden Weapon:<Br>\n\nThis is an upgrade to a weapon the puppet is already equipped with. That weapon is concealed inside the puppet's arm and spring-loaded. The first time it's used in a battle it is automatically a Surprise Attack. This cannot be done with a Large weapon. After this upgrade, the weapon cannot be disarmed.<Br>\n\n  PP: 2<Br>\n\n  Cost: 25 Ryo<Br>\n\n  \n#### Legs\nHidden Weapon:<Br>\n\nBy hiding a weapon inside the puppet's leg, it allows the puppet to, well, attack with that weapon. Weapons of less than Large size may be installed. Weapons used may have a Stamina cost of up to 10, +5 per extra PP spent on this upgrade.<Br>\n\n\nThe first time the weapon is used in a battle, it is an automatic Surprise Attack. This uses the weapon's damage, speed, and so forth. You must pay for the weapon separately from this upgrade.<Br>\n\n  Cost: 2 - 4 PP<Br>\n\n  Cost: 50 Ryo + Weapon's cost<Br>\n\n\n<Br>\n\n   Mobile Legs:<Br>\n\nSpecial legs designed to go over any terrain, be it rocks, water, ice, or even up cliffs. These legs reduce immobilization penalties based on the condition of the ground by 1; you can stack this benefit by giving this upgrade to multiple pairs of legs. These legs can also use Water Walking and Wall Walking, if you have those abilities.<Br>\n\n  PP: 3<Br>\n\n  Cost: 50 Ryo<Br>\n\n<Br>\n\n\n   Tail:<Br>\n\nYour puppet replaces its legs with a tail! This reduces its movement speed by 25% (or, if the puppet still has another pair of legs, the pair converted into a tail just doesn't provide a 25% increase in movement speed) but reduces immobilization penalties based on the condition of the ground by 2, and all other immobilization penalties by 1. Outfitting multiple pairs of legs with this upgrade stacks its effects by improving the size and quality of the tail.<Br>\n\n\nThis upgrade gives your puppet a +4 bonus to grapple rolls; that benefit does not stack if multiple pairs of legs have this. The tail is prehensile, and may grip and grab things, and counts as a single limb in a grapple.\n  PP: 3<Br>\n\n  Cost: 100 Ryo<Br>\n\n\\page\n## Monkasei\n<img \n  src='https://i.pinimg.com/736x/74/b8/f3/74b8f327eb2bf10eb75e415abaca40cf--puppet-naruto-shippuden.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n<Br>\n\nThe Monkasei lineage--they haven't organized themselves into a proper clan, despite gentle prodding from the village to do so--is viewed in generally good light by the people of Sand. Much of that comes from the fact that every member who displays their kekkei genkai is directly descended from the Third or Fourth Kazekage; the two weren't directly related, but most likely had a common ancestor, since they possessed an identical, or nearly identical, bloodline. It also helps that the Monkasei, as a general rule, are fairly modest about their bloodline and heritage.<Br>\n\n<Br>\n\nThat advanced bloodline is the ability to create magnetic chakra, and seems to have actually gotten stronger in recent generations; the Third Kazekage was hailed as the strongest Kazekage his village had ever seen, rivalled only by the Fifth, but his control of magnetic chakra was limited only to iron dust; he did not possess an actual magnetic jutsu.\n\n<Br>\n\nOn the other hand, that may simply be a result of the passage of time. He may well have been the first of his kind, and he had nobody's mistakes and successes to learn from. Even if the bloodline hasn't grown more powerful, it has become more refined, and while the number of inheritors is fairly small, they're flourishing and growing in number.\n\n<Br>\n\n```\n```\n\n\nMonkasei begin with Elemental Aptitude for Earth and Wind. They have Elemental Affinity: Jiton, which includes Doton and Fuuton.\n\n<Br>\n\n##### Monkasei start with 1 less Unique Point.\n\n<Br>\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n##### --( Jiton - Magnetism Release )--\n<Br>\n\nWhat sets the Monkasei bloodline apart from its peers is their advanced chakra nature. Though commonly referred to as 'magnetic' chakra,  there's more to it than that: even non-magnetic metals can be affected by their abilities. Most Monkasei realize their powers well before they can use ninjutsu, or sometimes even mold chakra at all, when they start intuitively dragging metal objects to them.\n\n<Br>\n\nAny Raiton or Doton technique can be converted into a Jiton technique, which the following effects:\n  -  +5 Chakra cost\n  -  All Jiton techniques have Magnetize 1 if they hit.\n  -  For every 25% higher the techniques damage is considered for wounding, the technique applies 1 to the Magnetize. If it cannot be blocked, it adds 3 to the Magnetize. For every 5 chakra over 30 a technique costs (Base), the technique applies 1 to the Magnetize.\n  -  All Jiton techniques have their base Speed increased by one per rank (1 for E, 3 for C, etc.). Thus, a Jiton Retsudotensho would be treated as a Speed 25 action for all purposes (including its minimum Speed after reductions), rather than 22.\n  -  All Jiton techniques have their total Speed (which as a reminder cannot be reduced below half their base Speed) reduced by the severity of their target's Magnetize. For example, if you were using the area-of-effect move Doryuu Taiga against four people, who had Magnetize 4, 8, 2, and 0, your technique's total Speed would be reduced by 8.\n  -  All Jiton techniques have their Chakra cost reduced by their target's Magnetize severity.\n  -  Jiton is strong against Raiton and Suiton, but weak against Katon. All Jiton techniques are considered as projectiles when determining how effective Fuuton-based defenses are against them (not because they necessarily are projectiles, but due to the elemental weakness).\n\n<Br>\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Magnetize )--\n<Br>\n\nThis is a status effect, which represents the target having become magnetized. Magnetize stacks fully with itself; someone with Magnetize 8 who's hit by a Magnetize 1 technique is elevated to Magnetize 9. However, a Jiton technique cannot raise a person's Magnetize over 2*(rank). Thus, a person with Magnetize 2 who was hit by an E-rank Jiton technique would not have their Magnetize status increased.\n\n<Br>\n\nJiton techniques used against someone with a Magnetize status get an Accuracy bonus equal to the status' severity. Metallic thrown weapons have an Accuracy bonus equal to half the status' severity. Magnetize fades entirely half an hour after the last time it was applied.\n\n\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Denji Yuusei - Electromagnetic Dominance )--\n<Br>\n\nYour manipulation of magnetic chakra has lots of potential uses! All of the following have a Chakra 10 cost, and are considered to be Jiton Ninjutsu effects.\n<Br>\n\n\nWhen throwing metallic weapons (arrows are no good for this) you may use CHA/10 in place of DEX/10 for your accuracy bonus.\n<Br>\n\n\nYou may also deflect attacks with any metal weapons, ranged or melee, by making an accuracy roll. This uses your CHA/10 in place of DEX/10, and receives any bonuses from having magnetized your opponent. This is a Speed 1 Interrupt\n\n<Br>\n\nFinally, you may disarm an opponent's held weapon as a Speed 6 action, rolling 1d20+CHA/8 against their 1d20+STR/10, once again receiving magnetize bonuses. If succsessful, you may throw the weapon up to CHA/4 yards in any direction, or bring it to yourself (and, if you wish, wield it).\n\n<Br>\n\nYou can retrieve, as a Speed 4 action, any discarded metal weapons or used projectiles within CHA/2 yards, bringing them to yourself.\n\n<Br>\n```\n```\n\n\n\n##### --( Mujona Kaiho - Merciless World Order )--\n<Br>\n\nBy no means the most powerful of a Monkasei's abilities, this is one of the most visually impressive. You project your magnetic chakra out across the battlefield, and use it to seize control of any discarded metal weapons--kunai, shurikens, even swords. Using that control, you're able to attack with impunity without having to make a single motion.\n  -  Type: Jiton Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Upkeep: 2\n  -  Speed: 4\nEffects:\n<Br>\n\nWhile this is maintained you may spend AP to make ranged attacks with any metallic weapons present and not being held on the battlefield. They have a range of CHA/2 yards, and use your ninjutsu, rather than physical, damage bonus.\n<Br>\n\n\nThis costs 1 AP per 2 Speed it would normally cost to attack with the weapon; the weapon uses its base Speed for damage purposes. This uses your CHA instead of DEX for Accuracy. These weapons don't benefit from weapon-specific abilities. They receive the full Accuracy from Magnetize as if this was a Jiton ninjutsu, but none of the other Jiton effects (such as applying more Magnetize) apply.\n\n\n\\page\n### Sabechi\n<Br>\nWhen Sunagakure initially organized itself into a formal village of Ninja, the Sabechi were the tribe most resistant to allying themselves with those who had been their rivals for generations.  They fought against change and the alliances that were being made, relying upon nature for their survival against what quickly became a much larger force.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nIn doing so, they resorted to extreme measures.  While no Sabechi ever confirmed as much, it is suspected that they tried all manners of profane rituals and struck bargains with the most dangerous and amoral of the species to be found within Sunagakure, which is how they began to produce a poison from their own blood.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nEventually they did assimilate into the village, sufficiently impressed by the collective force of the tribes.  For a long time they voluntarily segregated themselves, but over time they formed bonds with the Henzaki and the Hitori in particular, impressed by the former's talents and admiring the Hitori's spirit. The three clans, often teamed together, form an odd balance of sorts; a Sabechi's dark humor, a Henzaki's withdrawn neutrality, and a Hitori's overzealous enthusiasm.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nMembers of the clan are not a very vocal sort, with a sense of humor that is often classified as 'twisted'.  While well-mannered, most Sabechi have a sense of wit which invariably carries undertones not fully understood by those they converse with until well after they've spoken, making those that meet them frequently question just what they meant.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Rustblood )--\n<Br>\n\nThe very blood of a Sabechi is poisonous.  Along with minor inconveniences, like it being harder to give them transfusions and them being ineligible to ever donate their blood, it can also be used in combat as a very potent venom.\n\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 2\n  -  Scale: 0\n  -  Limit: 1 + XP/100\n\nYou can poison a weapon on your blood as a Speed 5 action by inflicting 1 point of damage on yourself. This applies 1+(Toxicology)/5 doses worth of poison to a melee weapon, or poisons up to that many thrown weapons. Your Rustblood poison has a +4 bonus to all its Toxicology rolls.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nThis poison's severity begins at 1, and increases by 1 every 4 ranks. It has a base Duration of 10. For every rank of Rustblood, you gain one Poison Point.\n\n<Br>\n  \nBecause this toxin is dependent upon the precise physiology of the Sabechi who produces it, it will break down rapidly outside their body. This prevents it from being stored for any significant amount of time, and means it can't be used to lace food or drinks.\n\n\n<Br>\n\n\nPoison Points are spent to add the following effects to poison, declared when you envenomate a weapon. These effects all have costs that function the same as ability costs, which you spend PP (rather than XP) on. For example, Paralytic is Base 3 / Scale 2. This means the first rank costs 3 PP, the second costs 5 (for a total of 8), and so forth.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nYou may not unspend and respend Poison Points at well; once spent, they are allocated. However, you may choose to use less than your full value; for example, your poison might have Paralytic 3, but you could choose to make a single use of it only Paralytic 1. \n\n<Br>\n\n\nThis is significant because each PP spent on applied effects increases the Vitality (or HP) cost by 1. So, using your poison at Paralytic 3 would add +15 Vitality to its cost, while Paralytic 1 would only add +3 Vitality.\n\n<Br>\n\n\\page\n\n\n   Paralytic<Br>\nYour poison debilitates the victim's muscles, slowing their ability to react. This inflicts Paralysis 1 per rank.\n  Base: 3\n  Scale: 2\n\n<Br>\n\n\n   Necrotic:<Br>\nYour poison causes rapid cell death around the area struck. Aside from taking longer than usual to fully heal, this inflicts Immobilization 1 per rank.\n  Base: 2\n  Scale: 1\n\n<Br>\n\n\n   Irritant:<Br>\nThere are many ways of accomplishing this. The most common is including some chemical in the poison that will cause an allergic reaction in most humans. Whatever the method, your poison causes irritation and possibly inflammation, and inflicts Burns of its rank in severity.\n  Base: 1\n  Scale: 1\n\n<Br>\n\n\n\n   Hallucinogen<Br>\nAffects the senses and mental functions of its victims, causing temporary disorientation and delirium.  It inflicts a -1 Visibility Penalty per rank.\n  Base: 2\n  Scale: 1\n\n<Br>\n\n\n\n   Neurotoxin<Br>\nCauses a temporary overload of the nerves, which stops proper brain function for a few moments.  Can be deadly in the midst of combat.  It inflicts 2 Stun per rank.\n   Base: 2\n   Scale: 1\n\n\n<Br>\n\n\n   Virulent<Br>\nYour poison is especially deadly, taking a longer than normal time to metabolize. This increases the Duration of the poison by 5. The first three ranks of this effect cost 1 PP; the next three cost 2 PP; the next three cost 3 PP, and so forth. So, for +50 Duration (10 ranks) you'd need to spend (1*3 + 2*3 + 3*3 + 4) = 22 PP.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n\n##### --( Mithridatism )--\nConstant exposure to the Sabechi's own venom eventually has their bodies produce antibodies to a variety of poisons, building up an immunity to even the nastiest kinds of venom.\n\n   Base: 5\n   Scale: 0\n   Limit: RES /30\n\nEffects:\nFor every rank, you reduce the rank of any Poison you suffer from by 1.  If you reduce the Poison's severity to 0 by this, you add a bonus to the Resistance roll against all secondary effects of the Poison equal to the Poison's severity.\n\n\n\n##### -=[ Predatory Protrusions ]=-\nEvery Sabechi has a way to deliver their poison naturally, without the aid of weapons--such is the nature of their bloodline.   As their skill expands and chakra develops, it's not unheard of for a Sabechi to begin manifesting other mutations.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nYou choose one of the four mutations below at creation.  For every 2000 EXP you have, you can voluntarily choose to lower your maximum Willpower by 1 to acquire an additional protrusion.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nYou may taken the Weapon Focus ability for &quot;Natural Weapons.&quot; This applies to any attacks made with your Sabechi clan mutations.\n\n\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Stinger )--\nThe most obvious of all the mutations and the signature feature of the clan, a Sabechi's stinger is far more potent than a scorpion's, even though they look about the same.  It's much longer than it looks, able to extend over the Sabechi's shoulder or around their side to strike those in front of them.\n\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Damage: (STR/10)d8\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Special: -5 Accuracy\n\nEffects:\nYou have a flexible tail with a curved tip.  Most Sabechi tend to wrap it around their waists as a type of belt, but some let it hang behind them.  You can attack with the Stringer even in a grapple, and if you do so you don't suffer the normal Accuracy penalty.  If you strike with this weapon, you can inflict a dose of your poison. When attacking with your tail, your Rustblood has no Vitality cost. Your tail inflicts Piercing wounds, and in a grapple you may make your attacks automatic called shots at no penalty.\n\n\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Quills )--\nWhile not true &quot;needles&quot;, some Sabechi actually have the ability to straighten the hairs on their head, which tend to be much thicker than normal hair, enough so to inject trivial amounts of their poison.  When used in groups, however, it can be quite deadly.\n\n  -  Stamina: Variable\n  -  Damage: Variable\n  -  Speed: Variable\n\nEffects:\nThis is treated as a Senbon multithrow, though it does not require the normal ability to do so.  If you use at least three Quills, you can deliver a dose of your poison with them. Unlike actual senbon, you won't run out of quills.\n\nThese are not actual senbon, and do not benefit from any senbon-specific abilities. Poisoning your quills requires the normal Vitality cost for your Rustblood, but does not have the maximum of 1+(Toxicology)/5.\n\n<Br>\n\n\\page\n\n\n\n##### --( Saliva )--\nSabechi who happen to deliver their poison this way tend not to get many dates, leading it to be the least common of all the mutations found within Sabechi, but those who have it swear by its usefulness.\n\n  -  Chakra: 12\n  -  Damage: (CHA/10)d6\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Speed:  8\n\nEffects:\nYou can apply a dose of your poison with this attack. As in, by spitting on someone. This is a taijutsu attack, though it uses your ninjutsu damage bonus and can only be parried as if it was a ninjutsu technique. It inflicts Energy wounds (due to the caustic nature of the saliva). As usual, this costs 1 Vitality for every Poison Point utilized during the attack.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n\n##### --( Oily Skin )--\nFrequently mistaken for sweat by their enemies, Sabechi with this mutation tend to enjoy trading blows with their opponents, crippling them the longer the fight goes on.\n\n  -  Stamina: 5\n  -  Upkeep: 2\n  -  Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nRather than being an attack, this is activated as a pre-emptive action. At that point you specify the composition of your poison.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nAnyone who strikes you with an unarmed attack must pass a Resistance roll  or be poisoned.  As a Speed 6 action, you can change the type of poison applied upon contact.  \n\n<Br>\n\n\nA new dose of poison is automatically applied to your skin (And therefore, deducted from your Vit/HP) every time you poison someone.  This can knock you unconscious, but will not reduce your HP below 0 (and will shut off, if the cost can't be paid).\n\n\\page\n### Kirigakure No Sato\nLocated in the south western part of Water Country, Kirigakure no Sato has a cool to moderate climate. Being near to the shore and often fluctuating in temperature, the village is swallowed by fog year round, leaving it perpetually moist and dreary. Entering Kirigakure, it's hard to make a quick judgment of its size. Stone buildings loom like ghosts dressed with sturdy flora disappearing from sight into the hazy countryside. \n\n<Br>\n\nAfter the war, Kiri was one of the first villages to recover. Being an island, its physical infrastructure remained mostly in tact. The first order of business was rebuilding the village's military strength. Previously Kiri had eradicated several clans who tried to overthrow the Mizukage and council elders. Perhaps it was luck, but some of them escaped the purge. Many previously exiled or near extinct clans, seeing Kirigakure weakened, came out of the woodwork and claimed their footholds, building new and better clan compounds and taking seats on the Kiri council. Kiri, realizing they couldn't afford to refuse them, allowed them back - but they live under perpetual observation. Shortly after, many of the people came to Kiri from the surrounding villages, having not fared as well through the war. While Water Country is still hurting for total population, Kiri appears to be bigger and stronger politically than in the past. Rumors abound of them more or less bullying local nobles and perhaps even the daimyo, though nobody--on either side--will confirm that.\n<Br>\n\nDuring the recovery after the Fourth Great Shinobi War, Kirigakure underwent reform. They did away with their chaotic, bloody past and introduced a new age of military power and structure, adamantly refusing to risk losing their seat as one of the Five Great Shinobi Superpowers. Because of this, students who begin to fall behind in the academy are pushed ever harder; those who can't keep up are cut out, without second chances. They start training their shinobi at younger ages than any other village, and their genin graduation happens a year or two later than most other villages. Should an individual remain out of work for an extended period of time or fail to meet village expectations, they're subject to review and the mercy of the Kirigakure council. \n\n<Br>\n\nMartial Law reigns supreme. In the past Kirigakure's greatest threats came from within - those days are no  more. The village wastes no time in snuffing out even the hint of rebellion or political discord. \n\n```\n```\n\n<img \n  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/71/Kirivillage.png/revision/latest?cb=20150501103335' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\nThe forces of Kiri can proudly call upon the Hozuki, Kaguya, Niou, Terumi and Touu clans in their hour of need. There was a time in which the seven swordsmen were but a faded memory, although that has changed. The swordsman corps of mist has once again risen to prominence to become a feared force. Because drunk, crazy,  violent island dudes with swords are dangerous.\n\n```\n```\n\n \n\\page\n## Sword Corps\n<img \n  src='https://i.imgur.com/jmHk3JY.png' \n  style='width:325px' />\nOne of Mist's several special operations units, the Swordsman Corps are trained to be Kirigakure's elite infantry. Militaristic and merciless, only the students who display an abnormal talent or fascination with swordsmanship are selected to be trained by the Corps.\n\n<Br>\n\nMist's swordsmen may not believe their kenjutsu is superior to ninjutsu or typical taijutsu; some do, while most admit it's simply a very specific focus. Most, however, will very adamantly reject the concept that natural talents or abilities, such as bloodlines, can match their rigorous training.\n\n<Br>\n\nA disproportionate number of the Mizukage's honor guard tend to be members of the Swordsman Corps.\n\n\n##### Members of the Swordsman Corps begin with 1 less Unique Point. Because they have no clue.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Blademaster )--\n<Br>\n\nMembers of the swordsman corps do not put as much effort into training with their swords as other ninja do into learning the basics of ninjutsu--they put in more. This rigorous training tends to leave members of the swordsman corp disproportionately grim, and exceptionally dangerous.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Cost: 10\n  -  Requires: Precision\nEffects:\nWhen using a sword, you use DEX/8 rather than DEX/10 to determine your bonus to Accuracy. Additionally, when making a sword attack you may choose to replace your regular accuracy with an accuracy roll (using 1d20 instead of 10 for the base value).\n\nIf you choose to use your physical damage bonus with a sword attack, instead of your Sword Damage Bonus from the Precision ability (found directly below this one), you do not receive the benefits of Blademaster on that attack.\n\n\n##### --( Precision )--\n\n<Br>\n\nAny ninja who uses a weapon seriously knows something about it beyond ;put the pointy end into the other person;. Mist's swordsmen generally understand their weapons, knowing the importance of a sword being well-balanced, and just how to cut someone to make the most of their weapon's momentum.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 5\n  -  Scale: 5\n  -  Limiting Attribute: DEX /20, Max 4\n  <Br>\n  \nEffects:<Br>\nYou have a special &quot;sword damage bonus&quot; of DEX/15 (to, as usual, a single decimal point).

Each rank beyond the first reduces the divisor by 1, to a minimum of DEX/12.\n\nIncreases to your Physical Damage Bonus do not affect your Sword Damage Bonus. However, anything which reduces your PDB (such as many wounds) will also reduce your SDB.\n\n\n##### --( Silver Flash )--\n\n<Br>\n\nOnce a sword kata has been perfected, you don't stop practicing it. If it is a ten-minute kata, and you know every step perfectly, you will do it in nine minutes, and then in eight. You learn how to not think about what you're doing, and instead simply do it. You learn to stop being a person wielding a sword, and become a sword guided by your subconscious.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 10\n  -  Scale: 5\n  -  Limiting Attribute: DEX /40\n    <Br>\n  \nEffects: <BR>\nEvery rank reduces the Base Speed of your sword attacks by 1, but increases their damage for the purpose of causing wounds by 5%.\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Daisho )--\n<Br>\n\nMost memebrs of Mist's Swordsman Corps have one sword which is distinct to them, and they learn to use it like an extension of their own body, often to the exclusion of other weapons. A select few, however, find themselves with the need or desire to own more than one. If these individuals are considered worthwhile, the Corps will allow them to have another one of Mist's famous swords forged for them.\n\n<Br>\n\nTechnically, &quot;daisho&quot; refers to a paired set of weapons used by samurai. It's a very precise word, with deep significance and a great deal of ceremonial importance. Well, at some point in the past some member of the Swordsman Corps decided to present themselves as a samurai, and adopted the term to refer to their own paired weapons. It caught on, because while ninja don't actually know anything about samurai behavior, it sounds impressive to claim you follow their ways, and now a &quot;Daisho&quot; among the swordsman corps refers to any set of weapons an individual personally values.\n  -  Type: Talent\nEffects:\nThis may only be taken after you already have a clan sword (meaning, you are of chuunin or higher rank). You acquire a second sword, which follows all the normal rules for a clan sword, designed separately from your first one. You may take this talent multiple times, acquiring a new sword each time.\n\n<Br>\n\n#### -=[ Clan Swords ]=-\n\n<Br>\n\nUpon becoming a chuunin, a Mist swordsman will receive their own, personalized blade. Most of them will have kept, used, and taken care of a single sword, usually a katana, from their days in the academy--in these cases, they usually opt to have that weapon reforged.\n\n<Br>\n\nThough they don't partake in the forging process, the ninja will be there the entire time, and it's followed by a ritual consecration, and a four-day period of solitary meditation in which the shinobi is alone with only their blade, fasting and subsisting off only just enough water to stave off dehydration.\n\n<Br>\n\nThe relationship between sword and swordsman is... interesting. Most swordsmen take care of their blade better than their teammates, and it's not even considered unusual for them to name and talk to it (if the sword starts talking back, though, that just means they're crazy).\n\n<Br>\n\nThere's more to this than lasting effects of the hallucinations from four days of fasting and partial dehydration. Members of the swordsman corps always know where their sword is, in terms of distance and direction. It could be on the other side of the world, and given enough time, they'd be able to track it down.\n\n<Br>\n\nMany claim their swords are 'loyal' to them (others just say their weapons are unique and they're the only ones who know how to use them properly); and, indeed, a borrowed or stolen sword functions as an ordinary katana, nothing more, in the hands of anyone but its rightful owner.\n\n<Br>\n\nIn the event one of these swords is hopelessly lost (say, tossed to the bottom of the ocean, or thrown into a volcano) a new one can be forged for the swordsman, though this is not done lightly; if given the chance, most would literally fight through hell to get their sword back. It takes four weeks to obtain a replacement sword, after which the original will no longer recognize its former owner. A member of the swordsman corps who accepts a replacement blade when it's in any way possible to reclaim their old one is viewed with severe disdain by their fellow swordsmen. (Using a regular katana in the meanwhile, however, is perfectly acceptable).\n\n<Br>\n\nUpon reaching Chuunin rank all members of the Swordsman Corps receive their own weapon automatically. Once you've reached that rank, use the rules here to customize your personal weapon.\n\n<Br>\n\nYour sword begins with 20 points which you can spend on it at your discretion. The first thing for you to do is choose its Structure features; this is its basic shape and so on. There are 5 primary characteristics to select here, and each one has a point cost listed next to it; for example, &quot;(2) Slashing&quot; means it costs 2 of your 20 points to make your weapon inflict Slashing damage.\n\n<Br>\n\nAfter selecting all your Structure options, you move on to Features. Although prices are in the same format, the layout is different.\n\n<Br>\nFeatures relate to three key components of your weapon: its balance (how easy it is to handle), its blade (how sharp, and other special characteristics), and its body (its weight and sturdiness). They are also divided into three tiers: Bottom, Middle, and Top. To take features in the Middle tier, you must have spent at least 5 of your sword customization points in that group; to take features from the Top tier, you must have spent at least 10 points in that tree.\n\n<Br>\nFor example, if you spent  7 points on Low-tier and 3 points on Middle-tier features in Balance, you could take the top-tier Balance features. You would still be restricted to Low-tier Blade and Body features, unless you also spent enough points in those trees.\n\n<Br>\n\nYou must spend at least 1 point in one of the three primary trees of Features. There are also Special Features, which have two differences from regular features. The first, they only have Bottom and Middle tiers. The second, they will not determine your sword's number of damage dice.\n\n\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n1. Structure\n------------------------------\n\n<Br>\n\n1. Damage Type\nEvery weapon must have at least one damage type. If it's both, you can decide whether to deal slashing or piercing damage each time you attack, and the weapon can be used with Slashing- or Piercing-only moves (though in that case it deals only the type of damage allowed by the technique).\n  -\t(2) Slashing\n  -\t(2) Piercing\n\n2. Size\nA weapon may have only one size. Size determines both which jutsu and abilities it functions with, as well as the number of damage dice it rolls.\n  -\t(0) Normal: 6d_ damage\n  -\t3) Small: 4d_ damage\n  -\t(3) Large: 8d_ damage\n\n3. Two-Handed?\nOnly Large weapons may be two-handed. If a weapon is two-handed, it can't be used one-handed unless you have the Monkey Grip ability. You may only choose one of these options.\n  -\t(0) One-Handed\n  -\t(4) Two-Handed\n\n4. Number\nSome swordsmen have more than one weapon. The Dual tag does not actually grant you an additional sword, just means your weapon is optimized for dual-wielding (as per the ability). If you take Paired, you get a second weapon which has 13 points to spend normally, and may not take Paired itself.\n  -\t(3) Dual\n  -\t(5) Paired\n\n5. Damage\nNot something you spend points on, this time! Of the three primary feature sets below (Quick, Steady, and Strong), determine which one you have the most points in. If there's a tie, choose one. That determines your sword's Speed, Stamina cost, and die size.\n  -\tBalance: Speed 10, Stamina 8, _d6 damage\n  -\tBlade: Speed 12, Stamina 10, _d10 damage\n  -\tBody: Speed 15, Stamina 14, _d12 damage\n\t\n```\n```\n\n\n====================\n2. Features\n------------------------------\n\n\n##### -=[ Balance ]=-\n\n###### Bottom:\n  -\t(1) +2 Bleed, -1 die of damage. Your sword must deal at least 1d_ damage. This status effect is automatically   -\tapplied if the sword does damage.\n  -\t(1) If you spend AP on a sword attack, and miss, half the AP spent (rounded down) is refunded.\n  -\t(1) Your sword deals +1d_ damage, to a maximum of +4d_.\n  <Br>\n  \n###### Middle:\n  -\t(2) -1 base Speed, maximum of -2.\n  -\t(1) +1 Parry, to a maximum of +2\n  -\tTop:\n  -\t(1) Your Parry has its base Speed reduced by 1. This can only be taken once.\n  -\t(1) The weapon may be held with one less hand than normal. This allows a two-handed weapon to be one-handed without difficulty (though does mean it loses is two-handed damage bonus). A weapon that requires &quot;no hands&quot; can be strapped to your body somehow.\n\n\n##### -=[ Blade ]=-\n\n###### \tBottom:\n  -\t(2) Your sword's damage is increased by 10% for the purposes of determining wounds; this can be taken up to 5 times.\n  -\t(1) Your sword attacks have their damage bonus increased by 1, but their Accuracy decreased by 1 as well.\n  -\t(2) Your sword's die size is increased by 2, to a maximum of _d20.\n    <Br>\n  \n###### Middle:\n  -\t(1) Attempting to parry your sword has a -1 penalty, to a maximum of -3.\n  -\t(1) Your sword deals three more dice of damage but has its Stamina cost increased by 4.\n\tTop:\n  -\t(2) Your sword deals another STR/20 dice of damage, but has its Stamina cost increased by the number of dice added this way.\n  -\t(2) Your weapon's dice become .extra(die size-2). This can be purchased repeatedly, each time lowering the .extra value by 1 (from .extra(10) to .extra(9), then .extra(8), and so on).\n\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### -=[ Body ]=-\n###### Bottom:\n  -\t(1) You have a +1 bonus to rolls made to disarm an opponent's weapon, and a +1 bonus to any of your defenses against being disarmed. Your sword's base Speed is increased by 1.\n  -\t(1) If you block while holding your sword, you gain a DR equal to your Sword Damage Bonus; this is multiplied by the number of times you've taken this feature, and doubled if used with the mid-tier Weapon Block ability.\n  -\t(2) Your sword gains a Stun 1, to a maximum of Stun 4.\n<Br>\n\n###### Middle:\n  -\t(2) Weapon Block: While wielding your sword, you can block weapon attacks as a Speed 4 Interrupt.\n  -\t(2) You may declare when you make your attack that you are reducing its damage by 50%. If it hits, it gains a Stun of (damage dealt)/50. If you purchase this feature a second time, you reduce your damage by only 25%. It cannot be taken more than twice. This adds to the low-tier Stun effect if you have it.\n  -\t(1) Anyone attempting to parry your sword does so at a -1 penalty. This can be taken up to 4 times.\n\tTop:\n  -\t(3) While blocking, you can declare Block as your defense against a disarm attempt. This allows you to use your normal Accuracy value, or make an accuracy roll, against the disarm attempt, with a +5 bonus (in addition to all other Steady bonuses).\n\n\n====================\n3. Special Features\n------------------------------\n\n##### -=[ Small ]=-\n###### Bottom:\n  -\t(3) Your sword has +1 Accuracy, but -0.5 to your damage bonus. This has a maximum of +2 / -1.0\n  -\t(1) Someone trying to parry your sword with a weapon does so as if your attack's Speed was 1 lower. This can be taken twice.\n\tMiddle:\n  -\t(2) Your sword's base Speed is reduced by 1. This can be taken twice.\n  -\t(1) The sword has a compartment in the handle for poison. It can hold up to three doses, which must be of the same type of poison. This allows you to, as a Speed 0 action, coat your blade with poison for a single attack.\n  -\t(2) Your sword gains a Stun 1, to a maximum of Stun 4.\n<Br>\n\n##### -=[ Large ]=-\n<Br>\n\n###### Bottom:\n  -\t(2) Your sword's base Speed is increased by 2, it gains Delay 2, and your sword damage bonus is also increased by 2 when using it. This may be taken twice.\n  -\t(2) Anyone trying to parry or disarm your sword does so at a -1 penalty. However, your parries with your weapon similarly have a -1 penalty.\n  <Br>\n\n###### Middle:\n  -\t(1) Your sword inflicts a Stun 2 to anyone who successfully parries or blocks it. This stacks with any other stuns applied by your weapon.\n\n<img \n  src='http://www.heavenlyswords.com/images/T/Blue_Dragon_Katana_SW458BLD.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n##### -=[ Spiritual ]=-\n<Br>\n\n###### Bottom:\n  -\t(2) You use CHA/15 to determine your damage bonus while using your sword. If you take this feature a second time, the divisor is lowered by the Precision ability (to a minimum of CHA/12).\n  -\t(2) When rolling accuracy with your sword, you use CHA/10 rather than DEX/10.\n  <Br>\n\n###### Middle:\n  -\t(4) Twice a day you may call your sword to you so long as it's in a one mile radius. If it's nearby it will fly to your grasp; if not, it will appear in your grasp as if summoned. This can count as drawing it for iaijutsu. Additionally, you have a permanent +3 bonus to any attempts to resist your sword being disarmed.\n  \\page\n### Terumi\n<img \n  src='https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/narutofanon/images/f/f8/Lava_Explosion.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20130410181603' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \nOne of the few clans in Kirigakure that was never victim of the extensive bloodline purges in that village's pasts, the Terumi clan came about only after they had concluded. Most of the clan is descended directly from the Fifth Mizukage, from whom they take their name.\n\n<Br>\n\nTypically red-haired and slender, the Terumi have a slightly exaggerated, but ultimately accurate, reputation for being hot-headed and tending to react strongly (and often violently) to comments about issues they find sensitive. Whether what offended them was something a person actually said, or a simple mishearing on their part, doesn't seem to matter very much.\n\n<Br>\n\nSurprisingly for such a relatively new clan, the Terumi have wound up in a position of lore-keepers for the village. Mist's largest library, and the vast majority of its historical records, are managed by the clan.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nTerumi begin with Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Water. They have Elemental Affinity for Futton, which includes Katon and Suiton.\n\n##### Terumi start with 1 less Unique Point. Because property  destruction.\n\n<Br>\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Futton - Boil Release )--\nCombining fire- and water-natured chakra produces the somewhat inaccurately-named Boil Release; not all Futton techniques necessarily use boiling water. Some converted Katon instead manifest as a heated, often high-speed blast of corrosive mist.\n\nAny Suiton or Katon technique may be converted into Futton, with the following effects:\n  -\t+5 Chakra cost.\n  -\tFutton always deals Energy damage.\n  -\tOptionally, Katon techniques may use up to half their Chakra cost in gallons of water.\n  -\tKaton techniques which don't utilize water instead manifest as corrosive steam. When this condenses (after the technique is resolved), it adds 1/5 of the move's Chakra cost in gallons of water to the battlefield.\n  -\tYou may choose to boil off (remove from battle) up to half the gallons of water used in a technique. Each gallon 'destroyed' this way increases the technique's damage by 5%.\n  -\tBlocking Futton reduces its damage normally. However, its damage for the purpose of inflicting wounds is based off its unreduced damage. The same applies to partial defense.\n  -\tFutton cannot inflict Ignite. Instead, Futton techniques deal 5% more damage per point of Ignite they would inflict.\n  -\tSuiton techniques converted to Futton gain Burns equal to their Chakra cost divided by 5.\n  -\t Futton is strong against Katon and Fuuton, but weak to Doton.\n\n\n##### --( Boil )--\n<Br>\n\nChanneling your chakra into an impending water-based attack, you boil it harmlessly away before it reaches you.\n  -  Chakra: 5 + X/2\n  -  Speed: X\n<Br>Effects:<Br>\nThis can be used as a defensive Interrupt against any Suiton ninjutsu which requires gallons to be used. Make an Accuracy roll, with (CHA)/10 as a bonus. X is the amount of gallons used in the jutsu you're interrupting. If successful, the technique fails, and the gallons of water used in it are destroyed.\n\n<Br>\n\n##### --( Sekai ni Tokeru - Dissolving World )--\n<Br>\n\nThe Terumi ability to boil water and alter the pH of steam taken to a logical extreme, this boils all water within a broad radius within seconds, flooding the area with a rising high-temperature vapor.\n  -  Type: Futton Ninjutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 35 + X/5\n  -  Area: Special\n  -  Speed: 24\n  -  Seal Speed: 22\n<Br>\nEffects:<Br>\nThis destroys up to your CHA in gallons of water. Water present on the battlefield will be boiled off first, and then water used in jutsu with upkeeps. It's centered on you, and has an Area of 50 or up to X, with X being the number of gallons boiled, whichever is higher.\n<Br>It does X*(ninjutsu damage bonus) damage to anyone caught inside the area. As is normal for a Futton technique, blocking and partial defense will not decrease the damage from its wounds.\n  \\page\n### Touu\n<img \n  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/narutoff/images/a/a9/Cold_Shower.png/revision/latest?cb=20141226073010' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n\nThe Hidden Mist, and Water Country in general, has a dark past it would very much like to forget. And, while the Touu would just as much like for it to never have happened, they in many ways are symbolic of that dark, bloody past.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nWhen the people of Water Country embarked on their genocide against bloodlines, they were remarkably successful. Shinobi within Kirigakure who possessed distinctive kekkei genkai were suddenly demonized by their peers, and would end up being 'killed in action' on routine missions or simply vanish. Several bloodlines vanished forever.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nThe Touu did not, despite being the proverbial poster children for 'powerful, dangerous bloodlines'. Their powers manifested at a very young age, and could be used even without ninja training. They weren't arrogant, but they were special, and that was enough for them to be feared, hated, and ultimately all but wiped out in an orgy of irrational hate and violence.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nDecades later, Kirigakure found itself in an awkward position: it wanted to get as many of those bloodlines back as they could, but most shinobi with kekkei genkai were fearful and resentful of the village, at best, and guilt and old hatreds were slow to die down.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nThe Touu bloodline was forever diminished. The once-proud clan that had faithfully and efficiently served its village was no more; the village was left gathering up tattered shreds and trying to patch them back together, which all the success of a child trying to repair a torn-up work of art before their parents got home. Literally dozens of secret techniques were lost forever.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nThe Touu of the current generation are few in number, and tend to be cold, aloof, and perhaps a touch more prideful than is warranted. The wholesale genocide of your ancestors by the ancestors of your peers, at the behest of the organization you work for and the country you serve, is a little hard to get over. If people criticize them for being arrogant and thinking themselves better or different than everyone else... well, those criticisms always have an undertone of guilt to them. It's just as hard for everyone else to wash away that inherited shame as it is for the Touu to forget the taste of betrayal at the hands of those they served.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n\nTouu begin with Elemental Aptitudes for Water and Wind. They have an Elemental Affinity for Hyouton, which includes Suiton and Fuuton.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n##### Touu begin with 1 less Unique Point. Because they are flakes.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Hyouton - Ice Release )--\nTouu have the ability to use one of the coveted advanced chakra natures: ice release, combined the elements of water and wind. Ice release combined the flexibility of water with the penetrating power of wind.\n\nYou may convert any Suiton or Fuuton technique into a Hyouton technique, with the following effects:\n  -  +5 Chakra cost.\n  -  Blocking reduces the damage from Hyouton techniques by only 25%.\n  -  Unless an individual jutsu specifies otherwise, Hyouton inflicts Piercing wounds. Hyouton's damage for the purpose of wounding is considered 25% higher, which stacks additively with any existing increases on converted jutsu (50%+25% = 75%).\n  -  Fuuton converted into Hyouton may not be used with a fan, and gains a gallons of water requirement equal to half its chakra cost.\n  -  Any time someone is hit by a Hyouton technique, they suffer an immobilization penalty due to ice crystalizing on them and their muscles being numbed. This penalty is -1 for E-rank techniques, -2 for D-ranks, -3 for C-ranks, -4 for B-ranks, and -5 for A-ranks. This penalty fades at a rate of 1 per 10 IC.\n  -  Hyouton is weak against Katon, and strong against Doton and Suiton.\n\\page\n\n\n\n##### --( Suitenhoufukyuu - Water Sky Convergence )--\nOften considered the mark of the Touu bloodline, even moreso than their ability to use ice release ninjutsu. All members of the bloodline, even ones without ninja training, exhibit from a young age the ability to mentally control water. They can lift it off the ground, cause it to float between their hands, and even freeze it with a thought (or, conversely, liquify ice).\n\n<Br>\n\n\nFor a child, this is limited to what's nearby, and what they can see; for a skilled ninja, they can actually sense the presence of significant bodies of water (this does not include human beings or large animals).\n\n<Br>\n\n\nYou may use any water scattered about the battlefield to fuel your Suiton or Hyouton techniques, as if you'd performed the Water Gathering Technique. This does not allow you to seize control of someone else's water or techniques; if it's in a container, or is infused with someone's chakra, it's off limits.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nYou may take a Speed X action, with a Chakra cost of 5+2*X, to freeze or liquify (CHA/30, minimum 1)*X gallons of water on the battlefield. Ice may not be used in Suiton techniques; it can, however, be used to perform Hyouton (including Suiton jutsu which you have converted into Hyouton).\n\n<Br>\n\n\nYou can perform Suiton (but not Hyouton) jutsu without handseals, by adding (the base Seal Speed - CHA/10)/2, rounded up, to the action's base Speed. Normal alterations to Seal Speed (such as from Ninjutsu Specialist) do not apply to this ability.\n\n\n<Br>\n\n```\n```\nThere are even legends of Touu once being able to drop rivers on people.\n<img \n  src='http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/WildRivers/images/BullFalls3_700x288.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n##### --( Hijutsu: Sensatsu Suishou - Secret Technique: Thousand Flying Water Needles )--\n<Br>\n\n\nWater is gathered from the air, and then formed into dozens or hundreds (but 'thousand' sounds far more impressive) of long, levitating needles. Those needles are then directed a single target at high speeds; the needles nearly surround the foe, making evasion especially difficult.\n\nNote that this is a Suiton technique, and as such can be converted to Hyouton.\n  -  Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Damage: Up to (CHA/8)d10\n  -  Range: CHA/3\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n  -  Requires: 2 gallons of water per 1d10\n\nEffects:\nThis technique's damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds, and it always inflicts Piercing wounds. If it wounds an enemy, it also applies one wound of the next-lower rank\n\n\n\\page\n### HOzuki\n<img \n  src='https://i.pinimg.com/736x/2c/ce/1a/2cce1aa05c5489c039c3cc54460c0750--sexy-art-photography-amazing-photography.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \nLocated on the outskirts of Mist village, the Hozuki have been gradually growing in power as a clan. Serving as the guardians and peacekeepers (or 'peacekeepers') of the village, the Hozuki have adapted well to Mist's militarization.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nTheir clan's unique talents also make them excellently suited for ambushes and 'enforcement' operations; should things turn against their favor, the ability to liquify oneself entirely allows them many options to retreat, regroup, and return with overwhelming enforcements.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nWithin Kirigakure, everyone knows that the Hozuki can turn into water, but few outside the clan truly understand that ability's limits. Murmuring of dissent become a terrifying prospect when one imagines that every puddle or drain pipe could contain a Hozuki listening in.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n\nHozuki begin with one rank in Elemental Affinity: Water.\n\n<Br>\n\n```\n```\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Suika no Jutsu - Hydration Technique )--\nThe Hozuki clan's pride is the ability to liquify their entire entire body, from bones to organs to hair, turning into living water. Although they normally maintain a humanoid form, there is nothing preventing them from turning into a puddle and slipping under a door or escaping down a drain--though they lose their ability to perceive their surroundings if they don't keep at least their head intact.\n\n  -  Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Speed: Special\n\nEffects:<Br>\nLiquifying is a Speed 5 Interrupt (which does not require a roll to succeed), while solidifying is a Speed 0 action. While in water form, the following effects are applied:\n  -  You take only 25% damage from Suiton, and 50% from Katon.\n  -  You cannot block Doton or Raiton.\n  -  You take double damage from Raiton, and when hit, you are automatically affected by a Stun 5.\n  -  You are immune to physical attacks and medical ninjutsu.\n  -  You are immune to, and do not suffer the penalties of existing, Wounds.\n  -  You can breath underwater.\n  -  Your Strength damage bonus is set to 0.\n  -  You cannot be grappled (or grapple other people), and ignore immobilization penalties and effects which work by restraining or caging you.\n  -  You always have an additional 20 gallons of water to use with Suiton jutsu, which nobody else may access. If you figure out why, you get a cookie. This water is never used up, or considered to be added to the battlefield.\n  -  You cannot be burnt, poisoned, or ignited, and ignore the effects of those statuses while in liquid form; their durations still decrease normally (and Ignite automatically ends).\n\n<Br>\n\n\nYou may not liquify (though you can still solidify) if you are suffering from a Paralysis effect which was caused by a Raiton jutsu. If incapacitated while liquified you revert to a semi-solid, translucent gel-like form. In this state you do not heal at all unless immersed in water, at which point you begin recovering normally.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Masakana Namiochiru - Demon Fish Wave Crash )--\nPulling in water from all around you and extending your chakra from your watery form into it all, you turn a mass of animate water with a vague outline of yourself at the center. Despite the jutsu's name, the water constantly tends to change shape and features, but most who see it can swear they see something demonic formed. This not only offers protection to the user, but also allows them to come crashing down upon their enemies as well.\n  -  Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Requires: Suika no Jutsu active\nEffects: \n<Br>\n\n\nYou absorb up to CHA/2 gallons of water into yourself. In this form you do not take extra damage from Raiton, and are not stunned by it. You may use the water you've absorbed into yourself in Suiton ninjutsu without first performing water-gathering. You may not use any regular taijutsu while in this form, though you get +Gallons/10 to your physical damage bonus (rather than reducing it to 0, as would be normal for Suika), and a 'shield' of Gallons*15 HP that takes damage before your own vitality or HP (You lose the gallons when you lose this HP). The only Taijutsu you may actually use in this form is as follows:\n\n##### Crashing Tsunami\n  -  Type: Suiton Taijutsu\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Stamina: 20\n  -  Damage: 5d10+50\n  -  Speed: 20\nEffects:\n<Br>\n\n\nYou may move up to CHA/2 yards when you use this attack, and you may collect up to CHA/10 additional gallons into yourself during this movement, assuming they are present on the battlefield, but not above your maximum amount.\n\n\n<Br>\n\n\n##### --( Suiton: Gosuiwan no Jutsu - Water Release: Great Water Arm Technique )--\nPutting their hydration technique to practical, but less-extreme use, a Hozuki can force moisture into a single limb (typically an arm) and give themselves what amounts to hydraulic muscles. The difficulty of this technique comes from how essential it is to properly control the distribution of water throughout the body. Used properly, this gives superhuman strength.\n  -  Type: Suiton Ninjutsu, Rank B\n  -  Chakra: 20 + 2 * X\n  -  Upkeep: X /2\nEffects:\n<Br>\n\n\nThis increases your physical damage bonus by X, but gives you a -2 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls due to being put off-balance by your enlarged limb(s). X has a maximum of CHA/20. This extreme strength is particularly useful for punching down doors or walls which are insufficiently reinforced. Notably, this cannot be used when Suika no Jutsu is active.\n\n<img \n  src='https://cdn-themeaningfullif.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tsunami2.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\\page\n### Niou\n<img \n  src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rvyrVe28xCw/maxresdefault.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\nThe Niou clan possesses one of the most coveted techniques in the shinobi world: invisibility. Despite that, they've avoided becoming famous. There are very few Niou; rather than trying to generate a reputation that would have shinobi around the world terrified of their prowess, they downplay and obfuscate their abilities.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nTheir 'invisibility' is most frequently dismissed as more Mist ninja trickery, hiding behind veils of chakra-enhanced fog and ninjutsu. The Niou are happy to keep things that way, and their village quietly encourages this subterfuge. Even within Kirigakure, the Niou are few enough in number to be passed off as just a large extended family, not an actual ninja clan.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nNiou tend to prefer to adopt in to their clan, and many of these orphans keep their original name, rather than take the clan's. They may pride themselves on membership, but possessing a different last name makes it that much harder for another shinobi to connect the dots.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nDespite their outward appearance of being largely disconnected, Niou tend to have a close-knit companionship with each other, a mutual respect that transcends personal grudges. They are raised to be quietly but firmly loyal to their clan and village, and to prefer reserved confidence over boastful ambition.\n\n<Br>\n\n\nNiou frequently gather together to brag of their exploits to one another, simply to avoid doing so to other members of the village, who may not fully understand their invisibility technique--everybody likes to brag, after all.\n\n<Br>\n\n```\n```\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]--\n\n##### --( Genshin no Jutsu - Invisibility Technique )--\n\nThe pride of the Niou clan, and their most closely guarded secret: this wraps the user in a layer of chakra, and projects their surroundings across their skin. A slight distortion is the only indication that anything is out of the ordinary, the technique even providing the illusion of distance.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E\n  -  Chakra: 10\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Speed: 8\n<Br>\nEffects:\nYou become invisible. While invisible, you may Hide at will, with a +5 bonus; while hidden, you are always considered to be one Stealth category higher than you actually are. When making a Stealth roll, or an Espionage roll to be unnoticed (such as pilfering something, or picking a pocket) you roll 2d20.takeHighest(1) instead of 1d20. Those Espionage rolls also receive a +5 bonus.\n\nYour dodge rolls while invisible receive a similar benefit: you roll 2d20.takeHighest(1) rather than 1d20. This doesn't apply to other defenses, or against area-of-effect techniques.\n\n\n##### --( Maboroshi no Jutsu - Phantom Technique )--\n<Br>\n\nYou project your chakra over another person, granting them invisibility as well. This requires you to make physical contact with them when it's first applied, and they must remain within (your CHA)/2 yards for its effects to persist.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Base Cost: 10\n  -  Scale: 5<Br>\n\nEffects:\nYou can conceal one additional person, or person-sized object, with Genshin no Jutsu per rank. This does require Genshin be active on yourself, and each additional person concealed this way increases its upkeep by 3. People and items concealed this way use your stealth in place of their own; if you're hiding a group, you make only a single Stealth roll for the entire group.\n\n\n##### --( Meimei Arashi - Invisible Tempest )--\n<Br>\n\nWrapping a weapon or held object in your chakra-induced veil of invisibility is easy; unfortunately, that does not extend to thrown weapons, as their invisibility comes to an end as soon as they leave your grasp. This technique exists specifically to patch that hole in the Niou's invisibility: it allows you to veil one or more thrown weapons in your chakra, keeping them unseen until they've struck their target.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: Special\n  -  Requires: Genshin no Jutsu active<Br>\n\nEffects:\nThis supplements a throwing or multi-throwing attack by making it an automatic surprise attack. Its Chakra cost is equal to the Stamina cost of the attack being used. If used from hiding, this reduces your Stealth TN by only 2 each time it's used.\n\\page\n### Kaguya\n<img \n  src='https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/narutooriginals/images/3/3a/Kaguya.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140714040812' \n  style='width:325px' />\nOriginally, the Kaguya clan was not much more than a bunch of blood-thirsty, barbaric warriors brought into Kirigakure for their ferocity in battle. Following a failed coup d'etat against the village, the clan was virtually wiped out--for nearly a generation, in fact, it was believed that they had become extinct.\n\n<BR>\n\nThe re-emergence of the Kaguya clan was discovered by one of Mist's hunter-nin, capturing a renegade ninja who had an unidentifiable body composition.  Mist 'negotiated' their return to the village, and within a few generations the Kaguya clan had begun its rise to prominence.  They were given their own compound and priority in missions, and became, once again, the most feared clan within Kirigakure.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nAlong with a kekkai genkai that is touted as the ultimate taijutsu ability, Kaguya are feared for their bloodlust and their refusal to surrender.  They will often refuse to stop fighting against overwhelming odds, preferring a bloody death to a peaceful surrender and a long life.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nMindful of the Kaguya's past betrayal, all of the perks given to the clan came with restrictions.  All Kaguya are branded at a young age with two dots just above their eyebrows, in the center of their forehead.  While not especially well known by those outside of Kirigakure, within the village it is a marking that commands respect by most, fear by many, and suspicion by a few. Many Kaguya shave their eyebrows as well; it's something of a clan tradition, but by no means enforced.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nWhile there are no official restrictions, in practice the ranks and positions of members of the Kaguya clan are closely monitored. It speaks volumes that there has yet to be a Kaguya hunter-nin. They're respected, but not trusted.\n\n<BR>\n\n\n\n##### Kaguya begin with 1 less Unique Point. Because they have a bone to pick.\n\n<BR>\n\n\n\n#### -=[ Abilities ]=-\n\n<BR>\n\n\n##### --( Shikotsumyaku - Dead Bone Pulse )--\n<BR>\n\n\nThe proper name of the Kaguya clan's advanced bloodline, this gives them the ability to manipulate their skeletal structure by infusing it with chakra. The primary capability is allowing the user to induce rapid, focused bone growth at will. Truly powerful Kaguya were dreaded as having indestructible bodies.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Speed: 7\nEffects:\nYou acquire any one Skeletal Modification.\n\n\n##### --( Shitaikotsu Rensa - Corpse Bone Chain )--\n<BR>\n\n\nMuch like Kaguya themselves in a battle, their bloodline seems to grow stronger over time, with no apparent upward limit. That a Kaguya's power grows exponentially when compared to that of their peers is one of the factors that makes them so valuable to Mist--and so carefully watched.\n  -  Type: Ability\n  -  Cost: 10\n  -  Scale: 0\n  -  Limit: Max Willpower\n<Br>Effects:\nWhenever you acquire a Skeletal Modification, from any source, you may increase your Stamina penalty by 2 and gain any other Skeletal Modification (which does not have to be one that technique could normally provide). This may be used a number of times per battle equal to your ranks in this ability.\n\n\\page\n\n\n##### --( Teshi Sendan - Ten-Finger Drilling Bullets )--\n<BR>\n\nYou can fire the bones of your fingertips at opponents. They fly faster than most weapons, and rotate quickly enough to literally drill through most defenses before losing their momentum.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 5 + 2 * X\n  -  Damage: Xd10\n  -  Range: 10+RES/10\n  -  Speed: 10\n<BR>\n\n\nEffects:\nYou fire X projectiles, up to a maximum of 10; your damage bonus for this attack is increased by 0.25 per projectile. This attack deals Piercing damage and ignores armor. For the purposes of defending against Teshi Sendan it is considered a multi-throw, though it is not subject to other multi-throw rules.\n<BR>\n\n\n\nTeshi Sendan's damage is increased by X*10% for the purposes of dealing wounds. Regardless of its actual Speed, it uses X as its Speed for the purposes of determining damage. Any defenses with a set amount of HP (such as Earth Shore Return) take double damage from Teshi Sendan.\n<BR>\n\n\n\nYou may take Weapon Focus: Teshi Sendan, which increases its Chakra cost appropriately (since Teshi Sendan does not have a Stamina cost).\n<BR>\n\n\n\nSkeletal Modifications:\nOsteogensis\n\n\n##### --( Tsubaki no Mai - Dance of the Camellia )--\n<BR>\n\n\nBy manipulating their skeleton, Kaguya are able to extrude weapons made of bone through their flesh, pulling them out the rest of the way and using them in combat. Despite being bones, these are stronger than iron.\n  -  Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Speed: 10\n<BR>\n\n\nEffects:\nYou can create any non-Large weapon from the Equipment section of the PHB, other than bows (arrows are fine). If you wish, you may 'draw' these weapons as part of this action, simply discard them, or keep them partially extended from your skeleton, ready to be 'drawn' whenever you wish. If you are creating a weapon with the 'Dual' property, you can create two of them with only one use of this technique, though doing so increases its Chakra cost by 5.\n<BR>\n\n\n\nIn the hands of anyone but a Kaguya these have a -3 Accuracy penalty. Your own bone weapons have a +2 bonus to their Accuracy when you are using them. Other Kaguya using your weapons receive no penalty or bonus.\n<BR>\n\n\n\nSkeletal Modifications:\nBlades, Spurs, Osteogenesis, Skeletal Realignment\n\n\n##### --( Karamatsu no Mai - Dance of the Larch )--\n<BR>\n\n\nThis technique creates razor-sharp bone spikes all over the user's body, branching off from the existing skeletal structure. These bones can stop attacks on their own, or if necessary the user can spin in place, turning themselves and the area around them into a veritable death trap.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank D\n  -  Chakra: 22\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 8\n<BR>\n\n\nEffects:\nThis is a melee-range parry with a +1 bonus per rank of Bone Spurs you have active. If successful, they also take damage from your Spurs as if they had struck you, plus your damage bonus multiplied by this technique's speed. This can not deal damage against a Large weapon attack.\n<BR>\n\n\n\nSkeletal Modifications:\nBlades, Spurs\n\n\n##### --( Yanagi no Mai - Dance of the Willow )--\n<BR>\n\n\nA multitude of bones protrude from the body, most commonly along the joints of the shoulders, elbows and knees, creating sharp spikes that extend outward in several directions, turning their entire body into a weapon.  Thereafter, the user can focus on evasion and counterattacking, with minimal movement required to strike at anyone who comes near.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 6\n<BR>\n\n\nEffects:\nWhile maintaining Dance of the Willow's Upkeep, you may spend 4 AP to attack anyone in melee range using your bones. By raising the cost to 6 AP you improve this attack to target everyone in melee range with you. You may attack with Dance of the Willow at most once every 10 IC, and it is always considered to be a surprise attack.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nThis is treated as a Speed 8 action, though it does not allow you to move as part of the attack; you do not delay your next action because of this, but that Speed is used to determine viable defenses and damage bonus. You can spend additional AP to lower the effective Speed further. Parrying Dance of the Willow reduces its damage by half and prevents it from inflicting wounds, rather than defending against it fully.\n<BR>\n\n\n\nYou acquire a Skeletal Modification every time you spend AP to activate Dance of the Willow, but not when you first use the jutsu and pay its chakra cost.\n<BR>\n\n\n\nSkeletal Modifications:\n<BR>\n\n\nArmor, Blades, Spurs, Skeletal Realignment\n\\page\n\n\n\n##### --( Tessenka no Mai - Dance of the Clematis )--\n<BR>\n\n\nThrough the use of Shikotsumyaku, the Kaguya creates a bone weapon from one of the central bones of the body (typically the femur or the spine), which is then augmented further. The resulting weapon is both stronger and lighter than any metal, making it positively devastating in the hands of a skilled Kaguya.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Speed: 20\n<BR>\n\n\nEffects:\nThis creates a Large Piercing weapon, which can use both Sword and Polearm abilities and techniques. Attacking is a Stamina 25, Speed 16 action. It deals 1d12 damage per Skeletal Modification you have, and you may take the Weapon Focus ability for this weapon. For each rank in certain skeletal modifications, its effects are modified as follows.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nArmor: -1 base Speed\n<BR>\n\n\nBlades: Damage is considered 5% higher for determining wounds\n<BR>\n\n\nSpurs: +1 Accuracy\n<BR>\n\n\nOsteogenesis: -2 Stamina cost\n<BR>\n\n\n\nSkeletal Modifications:\nAny\n\n\n##### --( Sawarabi no Mai - Dance of the Seedling Fern )--\n<BR>\n\n\nThe pinnacle of the Kaguya clan's techniques, this creates a countless number of bone spires around the user, creating an entire field made from their bones which they can shape as they desire.  The field entraps and potentially skewers everyone caught in it, and the Kaguya can instantly travel from one bone to another by melding in and out of them.\n  -  Type: Taijutsu, Rank C\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Damage: 1d12 per Skeletal Modification\n  -  Area: Physical damage bonus *5 yards\n  -  Speed: 25\n<BR>\n\n\nEffects:\nYou may instantly move anywhere in the radius as a Speed 0 action. Using this, you can increase the Speed of any action by 2 to make it a Surprise Attack. By melding into and out of the bones you can remove any Immobilization penalty (excluding those due to poison, genjutsu, etc.) as a Speed 4 action. While inside your bone field, you can attempt to Hide. When you hide, you begin at Stealth 2.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nIf someone attempts to escape the bone field, you may automatically Interrupt their action with any melee-range attack of Speed 10 or less by moving to them and attacking; if they are in Stealth when they attempt to do so, you automatically locate them in time to intercept. If you hit, this knocks them half of the way back towards the center of the field.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nWhen used, this effectively destroys any other terrain-based effects (such as mud on the ground). Inside the field, the Kaguya has a +5 bonus to Awareness. If this technique is used again when already inside its radius, the two fields overlap and combine; nobody already in the field will be damaged again; and the cost is halved, after applying Osteogenesis' reductions.\n<BR>\n\n\n\nSawarabi no Mai deals Piercing damage. Even if someone dodges Sawarabi no Mai, they do not escape its area; they simply avoid being skewered by spikes of bone erupting from the ground.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nAfter a few hours the bones will grow brittle as the chakra dissipates and begin crumbling. Within a day there will be nothing left but dust and bone chips.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nSkeletal Modifications:\nAny two.\n<BR>\n\n\n\n<img \n  src='http://rs139.pbsrc.com/albums/q316/Foxx_tha_only/Kimimaro_The_Last_Kaguya_Heaven_-27.jpg?w=280&h=210&fit=crop' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\\page\n\n\n#### -=[ Skeletal Modifications ]=-\n\nAs the Kaguya fight, their skeletal structure becomes increasingly better-adapted for combat. Every time you use one of your clan jutsu, you gain one of the following modifications. You can apply them repeatedly, their effects stacking additively.\n<BR>\n\n\n\nAdditionally, every time you suffer a Wound you gain a skeletal modification of your choice.\n\n<BR>\n\n\nIf you wish, you may suppress activation of these modifications. Suppressing any or all of your skeletal modifications is a Speed 0 action. Regardless, once combat has ended these effects all fade within an hour; bones retract into your body, and so forth.\n\n<BR>\n\n\n\n#### [ Armor ]\nYou extend your bones to cover your vital regions, forming broad, flexible plates. This gives you a damage reduction of (RES)/5, and can be applied up to 5 times.\n\n\n<BR>\n\n\n#### [ Blades]\nNumerous spikes and blades of hardened bone protrude from your body in combat-useful ways, such as from your knees, extending past your hands, and so forth. This increases your damage bonus by 0.25 for unarmed taijutsu and weapons created by Dance of the Camellia, or 0.5 for clan jutsu (including Dance of the Clematis' weapon), each time it's applied. There is no limit to how many ranks of bone blades you may apply.\n\n<BR>\n\n\n\n#### [ Spurs ]\nSmall shards and lengthier spikes of bones gradually cover your body, protruding from beneath your skin and injurying anyone foolish enough to strike you. Anyone who attacks you in melee range, including with any weapons of less than Large size, takes (your RES)/5 damage if they hit. This damage is also dealt any time they use a Grapple Jutsu against you. You can apply this up to 5 times.\n\n<BR>\n\n\n\n#### [ Osteogenesis ]\nThe more a Kaguya fights, the easier it becomes for them to do so. Every application of this modification reduces the Chakra costs of your clan jutsu by 2. You can apply this up to 5 times.\n\n<BR>\n\n\n\n#### [ Skeletal Realignment ]\nYou recover from any one wound of your choice which involves your bones, such as broken ribs.\n\n\n\n\\page\n# Equipment\n1. Obtaining Equipment\n2. Weapon-Specific Actions\n   a. Draw Weapon\n   b. Sheathe Weapon\n   c. Discard Weapon\n   d. Retrieve Weapon\n   e. Disarm\n\n\n====================\n1. Obtaining Equipment\n------------------------------\n\nNinja in the Naruto universe have an advantage which real ninja lacked: namely, magical chakra-based powers that let them perform superhuman physical feats, stand on water, and breathe fire.\n\nEven so, a wise ninja, magical or not, will equip themselves with a wide variety of tools. True, you could create a thick bank of fog instead of throwing down a smoke bomb--but that smoke bomb's faster, and less taxing.\n\nEvery piece of equipment has a cost in Ryo, the world's most commonly-used currency. You can get Ryo in two primary ways, the Money: Requisition and Money: Savings abilities.\n\nItems bought with Requisition can be traded in and replaced whenever you visit your village. Items bought with Savings are yours forever, for better or worse; if you lose them, they won't be replaced.\n\n\nItems can be divided into two broad categories: Consumable and non-consumable.\n\nConsumable items are gone once you use them once. These are things like smoke bombs, poisons, and explosives. Used-up consumables can be restocked when you get back to your village, if they were bought with Requisition. It is generally unwise to purchase consumables with Savings; if you do, once you use them they are gone forever.\n\nNon-consumable items can be broken, destroyed, or lost, but usually aren't. These are things like ropes, weapons, and lockpicks.\n\n\n====================\n2. Weapon-Specific Actions\n------------------------------\n\n   a.  Draw Weapon (Speed 5)\nWeapons are typically carried attached to one's person somehow; swords have sheathes, a pair of tonfa might be tucked through belt holsters, a fan could be strapped across your back, and so forth.\n\nDrawing a weapon is retrieving it from wherever you have it stored and placing it in your hands. At this point you can use it to attack, parry, or whatever else you please, the downside being that your hands aren't free for, say, handseals. You may also draw a weapon at the start of combat (when you roll initiative), without taking an action to do so. If you wish, you can draw two weapons as a single Speed 5 action.\n\nNote that you only needed to Draw weapons you intend to hold and use in melee. This Speed to attack with thrown or multi-thrown weapons includes the time needed to retrieve them from holsters.\n\nBe aware: While holding one or more weapons, you can still make basic unarmed attacks. You cannot, however, use Unarmed or Combo jutsu. Grappling is still possible as long as you have at least one hand free.\n\n\n   b.  Sheathe Weapon (Speed 5)\nYou put a weapon you're holding away, in some secure fashion. If you're holding two weapons, you can put them both away at the same time.\n\n\n   c.  Discard Weapon (Speed 1, or Speed +2)\nYou drop or toss aside a weapon. Done normally, this is a Speed 1 action. However, it may also be used alongside an Interrupt (such as a defensive ninjutsu technique) by increasing that action's Speed (after AP reductions) by 2.\n\n\n   d.  Retrieve Weapon (Speed 5)\nYou pick up a weapon on the ground. This can be your weapon, or someone else's, as long as nobody's currently holding it. You can only pick up one melee weapon at a time with this action, and must be able to physically reach it (which may require you to move first).\n\nYou can also pick up DEX/10 used throwing weapons and holster them appropriately.\n\n\n   e.  Disarm (Weapon's Speed +4)\nYou use a weapon you're holding to knock an enemy's out of their grasp, usually by hitting it at such an angle, and with enough force, that it becomes physically impossible for them to hold onto it.\n\nThis is a basic weapon attack that does no damage, but if it hits you knock their weapon STR/10 yards in any direction (if straight up, the weapon lands at their feet but cannot be retrieved for STR/10 IC). Trying to Parry a Disarm attempt has a -3 penalty.\n\nSmall weapons cannot disarm Large weapons, and Large weapons lack the finesse to be used to disarm at all.</text>\n\n>1. Swords\n   a.

When being used two-handed, the weapon increases its user's Damage Bonus by 50%.\n\nThe multiplication from two-handed weapons does not apply to the damage bonus increase from the Weapon Focus ability, or any ninjutsu which temporarily increase your damage bonus.\n\\page\n\n====================\n# 1. Swords\n\n#### a.  Katana (Slashing)\nThe traditional samurai sword, with a slightly curved blade and wavy design along the edge due to its forging.\n  -  Cost: 150\n  -  Stamina: 12\n  -  Damage: 8d8\n  -  Speed: 13\n  -  Special: +2 to parry swords\n\n\n#### b.  Ninja-to (Piercing)\nA small, light-weight straight-bladed sword with a traditionally square-shaped handguard, the ninja-to is, as its name may suggest, favored by shinobi.\n  -  Cost: 100\n  -  Stamina: 9\n  -  Damage: 4d8\n  -  Speed: 7\n  -  Special: Drawing and sheathing a ninja-to is a Speed 2 action.\n\n\n#### c.  Nodachi (Large, Slashing, One- or Two-Handed)\nThe largest practical weapon, a nodachi is is designed for use as a two-handed weapon. Ninja, however, have the brute strength necessary to use them one-handed, admittedly with some loss of efficacy. Nodachi range as great as four feet in length.\n  -  Cost: 200\n  -  Stamina: 14\n  -  Damage: 5d12\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Special: Anyone attempting to parry a Nodachi has a -2 penalty; however, when attempting to parry using a Nodachi, your accuracy roll suffers a -3 penalty, and the Parry action's base Speed is raised to 4.\n\n\n#### d.  Tanto (Small, Piercing)\nA straight-bladed dagger, usually double-edged, between six and twelve inches long. Good for stabbing people! Popular among reasonably wealthy civilians for purposes of self-defense.\n  -  Cost: 50\n  -  Stamina: 8\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Damage: 3d8\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Special: Ignores armor.\n```\n```\n\n\n\n#### e.  Wakizashi (Small, Slashing)\nAmong samurai, this is the traditional partner of the katana. The wakizashi has a blade about a foot and a half long. It's a relatively small sword, which makes it easier for ninja to conceal.\n  -  Cost: 75\n  -  Stamina: 8\n  -  Damage: 4d8\n  -  Accuracy: +1\n  -  Speed: 11\n  \n<img \n  src='https://www.karatemart.com/images/products/large/ninja-ops-full-tang-sword-set.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n\n#### f.  Zanbato (Large, Slashing, Two-Handed)\nAn enormous sword with a hilt over a foot long, and a blade more than four times longer than that, in traditional militaries the zanbato is an anti-cavalry weapon. Ninja, however, are hardly deterred by such impracticality.\n  -  Cost: 250\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Damage: 8d12\n  -  Accuracy: -3\n  -  Speed: 18\n  -  Special: Delay 2. If you have 80 or higher STR you may increase the damage by 6d12, by raising its Stamina cost to 20. If using a Zanbato to parry, the Parry action's base Speed is 4.\n\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n# 2. Polearms\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Bo Staff  (Blunt, Two-Handed)\nA weapon which sees more use in martial arts than among ninja, the bo staff is traditionally six feet long, though ninja scale their staves to their users. The bo is, essentially, a hard wooden pole, sometimes tapered at the ends.\n  -  Cost: 100\n  -  Stamina: 14\n  -  Damage: 4d10\n  -  Accuracy: +1\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Special: You may attack with a bo staff without triggering effects dependant upon being in melee with an enemy (such as most damage-on-hit effects). You can parry weapons with a +2 bonus, and unarmed attacks with a -2 penalty. When attacking, you may &quot;dual-wield&quot; this staff with itself by attacking with both ends, but when doing so lose its accuracy bonus; at this point, it is considered to have the Dual tag for the duration of that attack. If used as a Dual Wield attack, you do not receive the Two-Handed damage bonus multiplier.\n\n\n#### b.  Naginata  (Slashing, Piercing, Two-Handed)\nA weapon almost as traditional as the katana, and even more rarely appropriated for use by ninja, the naginata is essentially a wooden pole with a sword-like curved blade on the end.\n  -  Cost: 125\n  -  Stamina: 16\n  -  Damage: 5d12\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Special: By sacrificing this weapon's Accuracy bonus you can avoid any effects that depend upon you making melee contact with your opponent (such as some jutsu). Blocking is an additional 10% less effective against a naginata.\n\n\n#### c.  Tetsubo  (Large, Blunt, Two-Handed)\nRarely used among ninja, except ones who want to demonstrate how overpoweringly strong they are, the tetsubo is a large wooden pole, often with iron studs on the business end.\n  -  Cost: 300\n  -  Stamina: 20\n  -  Damage: 6d12\n  -  Accuracy: -4\n  -  Speed: 22, Delay 6\n  -  Special: Stun 6\nWhile being wielded two-handed, the user's damage bonus is doubled (instead of being increased by 50%).\n\n```\n```\n<img \n  src='http://www.nihonzashi.com/bokken_shinai_pictures/purpleheartwoodtetsubo_L.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n#### d.  Yari  (Piercing, Two-Handed)\nAn infantry weapon among mundane armies, the yari is about as simple as a polearm can get: wooden pole, straight wooden blade with a sharp point that you stick into other people.\n  -  Cost: 150\n  -  Stamina: 14\n  -  Damage: 3d12\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Special: This weapon's damage is considered 20% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds. By taking a -2 Accuracy penalty you can avoid triggering effects which rely upon you making melee contact with your enemy (such as some forms of damage reflection).\n\n\\page\n\n\n====================\n# 3. Miscellaneous\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Gunbai (Large, Blunt, Fan, Two-Handed)\nLarge fans with reinforced wooden slats, these were originally used by generals to signal soldiers on battlefields. Then some ninja was looking for a way to be unique, got ahold of the idea, and, well... the usual. Though they're several feet long, these fans do (impressively) fold.\n  -  Cost: 100\n  -  Stamina: 14\n  -  Damage: 8d10\n  -  Accuracy: -2\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Special: Delay 2. You may use a gunbai to block weapons, reducing their damage by 50% rather than 25%. This may be done 10 times before the fan breaks and is rendered useless.\n\n\n#### b.  Kama (Dual, Piercing)\nFarming tools used by the ninja of old, back before they had awesome chakra-powered pyrotechnics. A kama is pretty much a short wooden handle with a slightly-curved blade at a right angle to it on one end.\n  -  Cost: 25\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Damage: 5d10\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Speed: 11\n\n\n#### c.  Kusari-gama (Blunt, Piercing, Chain)\nA weapon that consists of an adapted kama on a narrow metal chain with a heav, typically iron, weight on one end. Some shinobi have been known to replace the kama with a heavy metal spike.\n  -  Cost: 175\n  -  Stamina: 12\n  -  Damage: Special\n  -  Accuracy: +1\n  -  Speed: 13\n  -  Special: You can strike with either end. The weighted end (Blunt) deals 4d8 damage, while the bladed end (Piercing) deals 8d8. The weighted end can be used to attack targets up to 5 yards away, and gives a +4 bonus to disarm attempts.\n\n\n#### d.  Nunchaku (Dual, Blunt)\nA pair of wooden handles attached by a length of rope or chain, a single nunchaku is generally wielded by grabbing one handle and using it to spin the other and bludgeon someone. Paired they do the same thing, except twice as much.\n  -  Cost: 50\n  -  Stamina: 9\n  -  Damage: 5d8\n  -  Accuracy: +1\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Special: If your last non-Interrupt action was an attack with nunchaku, attacking with your nunchaku has its total speed lowered by 1, to a minimum of 6.\n\n<img \n  src='http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111119154337/naruto/fr/images/1/11/Gunbai_Madara.png' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\\page\n\n\n\n#### e.  Sai (Dual, Blunt)\nA martial arts weapon, the sai consists of a single main, dagger-like spike, with two prongs extending from the handle. The points of this weapon are typically blunted slightly, and the prongs reinforced; it's a primarily defensive weapon.\n  -  Cost: 30\n  -  Stamina: 8\n  -  Damage: 2d8\n  -  Accuracy: +1\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Special: +2 parry. If you successfully parry any non-Large weapon with your sai, you may immediately, as a Speed 0 action, attempt to Disarm it. For the purposes of determining what defenses can be used against this Disarm attempt, it is considered to have a base Speed of 12 (the normal for a Sai's Disarm).\n\n\n#### f.  Tessen (Dual, Blunt, Slashing, Small, Fan)\nA small war fan, used, much like their larger counterparts, to signal troops in combat. Or, if you're a ninja, to kill people with. The tessen, as used by ninja, is a handheld folding or non-folding fan with, at the very least, a sharpened metal edge.\n  -  Cost: 50\n  -  Stamina: 9\n  -  Damage: 4d10\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Special: These may be used to parry unarmed attacks.\n\n\n#### g.  Tonfa (Dual, Blunt)\nOriginating from a small island off the shore of fire country, the tonfa began as a martial arts implement, which ninja have seen fit to 'borrow' and upgrade. A single tonfa is essentially a circular wooden bar the length of the wielder's forearm with a handle 1/4 of the way from one end. Typically wielded in pairs, they're an unorthodox but sometimes-effective weapon.\n  -  Cost: 30\n  -  Stamina: 9\n  -  Damage: 3d6\n  -  Accuracy: +1\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Special: +2 to parry, and you may parry unarmed attacks. You may block weapon attacks and reduce their damage by 50% as normal. This may be done five times with a single tonfa before it breaks.\n\n\n#### h.  Trench Knives (Dual, Slashing, Small)\nEssentially knuckle dusters, with the blunt or knobbed front replaced by a serrated blade which extends several inches past the end of the fingers.\n  -  Cost: 40\n  -  Stamina: 10\n  -  Damage: 4d8\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Special: +1 accuracy when using two to attack as one action. You may perform handseals while holding trench knives, increasing the Seal Speed by 3 (whether you're using 1 or 2).\n\n\n#### i.  Umbrella (Blunt, Piercing)\nYes, umbrellas. Ones used in combat are reinforced with metal or hard wood, making them semi-decent bludgeoning weapons, and most have a sharp, pointed tip added at the end.\n  -  Cost: 120\n  -  Stamina: 11\n  -  Damage: 6d8\n  -  Accuracy: -3\n  -  Speed: 13\n  -  Special: You may Block as a Speed 6 Interrupt while holding an umbrella. The umbrella may do this up to 5 times per battle before breaking and being useless.\n  \n>## Ranged Weapons\n1. Small\n   a. Kunai\n   b. Shuriken\n   c. Senbon\n2. Large\n   a.

Small\n------------------------------\n\n#### a. Kunai (Piercing, Thrown)\nOne of the two mainstays of ninja armed combat, the kunai is a small metal knife, shaped like an elongated diamond. On the short end it has a handle just long enough to wrap one's hand around, typically wrapped in cloth to improve the grip, and a metal ring on the end of that.\n  -  Cost: 10\n  -  Stamina: 5\n  -  Damage: 2d6\n  -  Range: 5 + STR/4\n  -  Speed: 6\n  -  Special: Kunai may be used as a melee weapon, in which case they are (Small) and (Dual).\n\n\n#### b. Shuriken (Slashing, Thrown)\nThe other classic ninja weapon, even more famous than the kunai, shuriken are small, flat four-pointed metal stars thrown at opponents to distract and mildly injure them. Like kunai, shuriken are black, making them less reflective and generally harder to spot in low-light conditions.\n  -  Cost: 5\n  -  Stamina: 5\n  -  Damage: 1d6\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Range: 5 + STR/4\n  -  Speed: 5\n\n#### c. Senbon (Piercing, Thrown)\nLarge metal needles, traditionally used in acupuncture. Rarely, particularly skilled shinobi will use these with devastating efficiency. Frequently, particularly overconfident shinobi will use this with depressing ineptitude.\n  -  Cost: 20\n  -  Stamina: 5\n  -  Damage: 1d4\n  -  Accuracy: -2\n  -  Range: 5 + STR/5\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Special: Senbon ignore the effects of enemy armor.\n```\n```\n\n\n====================\n2. Large\n------------------------------\n\n#### a. Fuuma Shuriken (Slashing, Thrown)\nA fairly complex device, a fuuma shuriken is four curved blades that can fold together and be used as an improvised blade in melee combat, or unfolded and locked open, taking on a pinwheel shape, to be thrown.\n  -  Cost: 100\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Damage: (4+STR/12)d12\n  -  Range: STR/3\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Special: For every point you hit by, you add 10% to the attack's total damage, to a maximum of +200% (so, if they dodged and you hit by 3 points you'd do 1.3 times damage, and that number would be reduced by the effects of partial defense); this does not apply if it is blocked. This weapon's damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds. You may also use the Fuuma Shuriken as a melee weapon, in which case it loses all of its other special effects and deals only 4d12 damage.\n\n#### b. Large Star Shuriken (Piercing, Thrown)\nThe name is about as literal as it could be: it's essentially a shuriken many, many times larger than a normal shuriken, up to four feet from the tip of one point to the opposite. It generally sees limited use in combat due to its cumbersome size.\n  -  Cost: 100\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Damage: (4+STR/12)d12\n  -  Range: STR/3\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Special: For every point you hit by, beyond full damage, you add 10% to the attack's total damage; this does not apply if it is blocked. This weapon's damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds. Because these are large and encumbering, they are typically worn somehow strapped to the back; for each large star shuriken beyond the first you are carrying you have a -1 penalty to dodge rolls.\n  \n\\page\n\n\n\n\n====================\n3. Exotic\n------------------------------\n\n#### a. Bow, Daikyu\nA large bow, generally bigger than its wielder at six feet or so high. The upper 'half' is actually 2/3 or so of the total length. As most ninja find these near-useless in combat, they tend to see more use in assassination missions.\n  -  Cost: 250\n  -  Stamina: 20\n  -  Damage: (STR/8) dice; die size determined by arrow\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Range: STR\n  -  Accuracy: -10\n  -  Special: The bow uses double your damage bonus.\nUsing a bow always takes two hands. You may take a Speed 10 Aim action which gives the attack +4 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a single attack. If you have to take any action which requires movement (including dodging), you lose the benefits of your aim.\n\n\n#### b. Bow, Yumi\nTechnically, it's called a hankyu, and kyudo practitioners would be horridly offended to hear shinobi calling all bows of this sort 'yumis'. However, ninja hardly care! The yumi is a much smaller bow, typically not more than four feet long.\n  -  Cost: 150\n  -  Stamina: 15\n  -  Damage: (STR/10) dice; die size determined by arrow\n  -  Range: STR /2\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Accuracy: -8\n  -  Special: The bow uses 1.5 times your damage bonus.\nUsing a bow always takes two hands. You may use a Speed 8 Aim action which gives the attack +3 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a single attack. You may dodge while Aiming, though this increases the Speed of your Dodge action by 3.\n\n\n#### c.  Arrow (Piercing)\nThese are necessary to use a bow in combat! Specifically, arrows are the ammunition for bows, and each attack you make with a bow requires you to use an arrow. Arrows can usually be retrieved after battle.\n\nArrows are expensive not because of their construction, but because ones of the quality that chakra-using ninja need are hard to come by; shuriken and kunai are competitively mass-produced, arrows are not.\n  -  Cost: 50\n  -  Damage: d12\n\n\n#### d.  Arrow, Piercing (Piercing)\nArrows with narrow steel tips that excel in penetrating armor and the like. These ignore the effects of enemy armor when dealing damage, but lose something in terms of killing power due to creating smaller wounds.\n  -  Cost: 50\n  -  Damage: d8\n   ># Gear\n   1.

Telescope\n\n====================\n1. Ninja Tools\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Blank Scroll\nA large scroll. Most of the time these are carried rolled up to save space. They're useless, aside from the fact that a few sealing jutsu make use of them.\n  -  Cost: 25 Ryo\n\n\n#### b.  Blood Increasing Pill\nThese pills contain a peculiar mix of chemicals that, when consumed by someone capable of using chakra (such as a ninja) will allow their body to rapidly replenish lost blood. When you take one of these pills you regain RES/10 HP (but not Vitality) each IC, for 50 IC. During this duration you take only one third damage from poison, and no damage from effects caused by bleeding (such as certain wounds). Using a Blood Pill is a Speed 10 action.\n  -  Cost: 250 Ryo\n\n\n#### c.  Caltrops\nSmall bits of metal that are basically just four short spikes attached at a center; no matter how they land, there'll always be a metal spike pointing upwards. The typical use is to scatter them across the ground to impede movement through an area. As a Speed 10 action you can cover an area with a 5 yard radius in caltrops. Anyone moving through the area going at more than half their maximum movement speed takes 1d4 damage for every IC they spend moving through the area; this cannot inflict wounds.\n  -  Cost: 20 Ryo for enough caltrops to cover one 5 yard area\n\n\n#### d.  Cloth \nBroad, sturdy cloth that looks like bandages, or perhaps mummification wraps. This comes in large rolls of up to 200 yards; carrying more than one roll inflicts a -1 immobilization penalty for each beyond the first (not due to weight, but because they're bulky). Confine Scroll Seals can carry one roll each.\n  -  Cost: 3 Ryo per yard.\n\n\\page\n\n\n#### e. Container, Small\nA container, usually a gourd, clay jug, or waterskin, commonly worn at the hip. One container can hold 2 gallons of water or another substance. For every container beyond the second, you suffer a -1 penalty to dodge due to encumberance.\n  -  Cost: 50 Ryo\n\n\n#### f.  Container, Large\nA large gourd or other sort of container, several feet long and usually worn on the back. It's heavy and bulky, but not quite enough to restrict the mobility of a well-trained shinobi. It can hold up to 8 gallons of water, but you can only carry one with you (due to its size!).\n  -  Cost: 150 Ryo\n\n\n#### g.  Flash Bomb\nFlash bombs are devices which, when ignited, produce brilliant flashes of light. Anyone who doesn't know to close their eyes when you throw one suffers a -4 visibility penalty for the next 10 IC. You can throw these up to STR/5 yards. Throwing one is a Speed 4 action.\n\nYou may also drop a flash bomb when dodging, in which case your dodge's Speed is increased by 4.\n  -  Cost: 30 Ryo\n\n\n#### h.  Ninja Wire\nHigh tension 16-gauge wire. It is generally only available in ninja villages, and comes in spools with various lengths of wire.\n  -  Cost: 50 Ryo per 100 feet\n\n\n#### i.  Rope\nI refuse to explain what this is. Individual lengths of rope can be purchased up to 300 feet (100 yards), but there's nothing stopping you from tying a few together. Tying somebody up requires 10 yards of rope, and the person in question to not be resisting.\n\nYou can tie someone up with ropes. If so, roll Espionage +10 to see how good your knots were. The result, or 20, is the difficulty of escaping. The user can try to slip the knots (Espionage skill roll, +DEX/10) which takes 5 minutes to attempt (they can hide that they are doing so via an opposed Espionage roll). This can be attempted repeatedly. \n\nYou can also attempt to snap the ropes using brute force. This calls for a roll of 1d20 + (Athletics /5) + (STR /10) against a target of 30, requires a Stamina 25 roll, and is done instantly, but repeated attempts cannot be made (either you're strong enough to break the ropes, or you're not).\n  -  Cost: 10 Ryo per 5 yards.\n\n```\n```\n\n\n#### j.  Smoke Bomb\nPaper balls small enough to be easily held in one hand, when thrown at the ground they burst and release wide clouds of smoke. Smoke bombs have a range of STR/5 yards, and can be thrown as a Speed 4 action. When thrown, it releases a cloud of thick smoke that causes a -6 visibility penalty to all people within its 5 yard radius, for 10 IC. Anyone other than the user in the area may, as a Speed 1 interrupt, make an opposed Athletics (Defender) vs. Espionage to avoid the smoke bomb, bringing them to the edge of their choice.\n  -  Cost: 50 Ryo\n\n\n#### k.  Poison Smoke Bomb\nSturdier than regular smoke bombs, and much more dangerous, these are filled with some manner of poisonous vapor. They're used like regular smoke bombs, but have a 10 yard radius, a -4 visibility penalty, and persist for 25 IC. When you buy a poison smoke bomb, select a poison (from the Poisons section) which has Inhalation as one of its possible vectors of delivery. When you throw the smoke bomb, make a Toxicology roll. Anyone who passes through the area must make a Resistance roll against that Toxicology result, or be poisoned. The cost of the poison smoke bomb is 100 Ryo, plus the base cost (unreduced by buying multiples) for one dose of the chosen poison. Anyone other than the user in the area may, as a Speed 1 interrupt, make an opposed Athletics (Defender) vs. Espionage to avoid the smoke bomb, bringing them to the edge of their choice.\n -  Cost: 100 Ryo + cost of poison\n\n\n#### l.  Soldier Pill\nThe proper name is 'military ration pills', but the term soldier pill is more commonly used among shinobi. They're less rations than fast-acting performance-enhancing drugs. Though every village has a slightly different recipe, the pills are all marble-sized and black or dark brown. When eaten, they have the approximate flavor and texture of sawdust. These pills are essentially just condensed stimulants and nutrients; taking one immediately lowers you a Fatigue category, and gives you +5 to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls for the next hour. Doing so is a Speed 10 action in battle. You may only take one per battle, and no more than RES/50 per day.\n  -  Cost: 250 Ryo\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n2. Survival\n------------------------------\n\n\n#### a.  Antidote\nAntidotes to several of the more popular and lethal poisons which shinobi use are widely available, for somewhat obvious reasons. A single dose of an antidote costs half the amount for a single dose of a poison; multiple doses cost half as much as the first. So, buying 2 doses of antidote for Black Adder venom would be (40+20) 60 ryo, and buying 4 doses of antidote for Yew toxin would be (60 + 3 * 30) 150 ryo.\n\nTaking a dose of an antidote is a Speed 6 action, and immediately cures you of the poison in question and all its lingering effects. Antidotes that act quickly enough to be useful in emergencies, such as combat, aren't gentle on the body, with each applying a -2 penalty to your Accuracy and all d20 rolls for 100 IC. However, for that duration you are immune to the poison in question.\n  -  Cost: Varies\n\n\n#### b.  Compass\nA small, typically handheld device that has a needle inside a metal case (with a glass cover, so it can be seen) that points, approximately, to magnetic north when held level. These aren't exactly precise, but they're good enough most of the time. Notably, they can have trouble working underground or if they get zapped by a lightning jutsu. When trying to navigate the wilderness, having a compass gives a +2 bonus to any Survival rolls. If you also have a map of the country you're in, this is raised to +4.\n  -  Cost: 50 Ryo\n\n\n#### c.  First Aid Kit\nA collection of bandages, ointments, and antiseptics. First aid kits can be used to stop bleeding from Wounds, as a Speed 10 action per category of wound. They can also cure Burns, with a Speed of 2 per level of severity of the burns. A single first aid kit can do each of those once before being expended.\n\nAlternately, it can treat a wound (in the sense of, &quot;this wound has penalty X until treated, and then only penalty Y&quot;). This is a Speed 15 action per wound category, and completely consumes the first aid kit.\n  -  Cost: 25 Ryo\n\n```\n```\n<img \n  src='http://www.keishamarine.com/marine-safety-product/upload/image_original/1%20Parachute%20Rocket%20(new).jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n#### d.  Flare\nA handy little pyrotechnic device, a cylinder usually a bit too large to fit comfortably in the palm. When lit (most have built-in starters or strikers, to avoid the need for matches) they shine brilliantly, enough that it can be painful to look directly at them without squinting, and become blisteringly hot. They burn out quickly, within half a minute.\n\nThe vast majority of flares are projectiles, with built-in propellant. Aimed upwards, they'll launch into the air. During the day, this is typically unnoticed if you're doing anything other than staring at the spot it's launched up waiting to see it, and know exactly where it will be. In twilight and darker conditions, however, a flare can be seen for a considerable distance; they're often used for signalling, though suffer from not being too discrete.\n  -  Cost: 40 Ryo\n\n\n#### e.  Flashlight\nFlashlights are popular because ninja like to be able to see in low-light environments! They're also useful because they can be turned off, or on, as needed. Quite handy for staying hidden when you hear unwanted company approaching. Flashlights have a battery life of about half an hour. A spare set of batteries (for another half hour of use) costs 20 Ryo.\n  -  Cost: 40\n\n\n#### f.  Glow Stick\nA transparent small (around six inches long, usually) cylinder filled with chemicals that, when mixed, glow brightly. A swift blow to the stick (usually striking it against one's knee; simply bending it with enough force will also work) will shatter the internal glass dividers, mixing the chemicals and producing a pleasing illumination.\n\nA glow stick will glow for about an hour; it cannot be turned off once activated, short of breaking it completely and letting the luminescent fluid inside it drain out (in which case you just have a glowing puddle). They're available in a variety of colors, with the most popular ones being green and blue.\n  -  Cost: 20\n\n\\page\n\n\n#### g.  Map\nA map of a given country. It's usually a really, really good for at least one person on every ninja team to have a map of any country they expect to be going through. These have only basic information about terrain, landmarks, and settlements. Maps come with scroll cases for ease and safety of transportation. A map gives a +4 bonus to any Survival rolls made in the appropriate country, within reason (they would help tracking someone, or finding shelter, but not exploring the inside of a cave).\n  -  Cost: 50 Ryo\n\n\n#### h.  Oxygen Mask\nThis is a small 'mask' that covers the wearer's mouth and nose, and is held in place by elastic bands which form an airtight seal. Rather than filtering air out, it has two possible fixtures (usually one on each side of the mouth) for an oxygen tank to be attached. When wearing the mask, the user has a -3 penalty to all Stamina rolls, as it takes a slight effort to breathe through it. Putting this on in combat is a Speed 5 action.\n\nWearing an oxygen mask with at least tank attached makes the wearer immune to external suffocation penalties (being inside an unbreathable cloud would not affect them; being physically choked would) and provides a +8 bonus to Resistance rolls against statuses that would be inflicted by breathing something in (such as poison mist); the mask is not perfectly air-tight.\n  -  Cost: 200 Ryo\n\n\n#### i.  Oxygen Tank\nTanks of compressed, breathable air, usually strapped to one's back. They're basically useless by themselves, but each comes with a hose that can be attached to an oyxgen mask. Each tank provides 30 minutes of breathable air.\n  -  Cost: 100 Ryo per tank\n\n\n====================\n# 3. Infiltration\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Camouflage Kit\nEverything you need to blend in with the environment, like a truly sneaky ninja. These come in four flavors: forest/plains, desert, mountainous/rocky, and 'other' (covering anything not one of those). A kit may only be used in its corresponding environment.\n\nUsing a kit takes 15 minutes, and is enough to conceal a person at level 3 Stealth; the stealth roll is made after they're fully hidden. The exact contents are fairly nonspecific, but regardless, each kit is good for only one use.\n  -  Cost: 150 Ryo\n\n\n#### b.  Camera\nCameras are rare devices, and ones suited for use by ninja even more so. Styles vary, but they are all small, and usually handheld. However, they are large enough that they cannot be effectively concealed while in use. The exact designs may vary greatly, though Sunagakure is fond of a model worn like a circlet on the head, with the lens covering one eye.\n\nMost models include a flash that allows blurry pictures to be taken in the dark. Each image uses a single piece of film, acquired separately. Facilities to develop the film are rare, but exist in all major shinobi villages, along with trained staff who will do so overnight for urgent matters, or within a week for personal needs.\n  -  Cost: 750 Ryo\n  \n  <img \n  src='http://cdn0.sbnation.com/assets/3511279/Df_SL_50_1.8_SE_frt34r-560.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n\\page\n\n\n\n#### c.  Camera Film\nThese are specially treated, light-sensitive pieces of paper. Due to the lack of standardization among models, pieces of film generally cannot be exchanged from one camera to another. These are usually stored inside the camera itself; if exposed to light before capturing an image they become useless, though afterwards there will be no effects from direct light on the paper.\n  -  Cost: 50 Ryo\n\n\n#### d.  Grappling Hook\nA three- or four-pronged sturdy metal hook. The typical use is to attach it to the end of a rope then throw it over a wall, up a tree, or across a small chasm, and hope it catches on something (such as a piece of architecture, a branch, or a appropriately-shaped rock). The user then climbs the rope to get to their destination!\n\nThese see limited use among experienced ninja, who typically have ways of easily doing the same thing, but beginners often find them useful, and they can be situationally helpful even for more advanced shinobi.\n  -  Cost: 100 Ryo\n\n\n#### e.  Lockpicks\nA set of small tools, easily carried in a pocket, used for opening locks in absence of the key. These allow an Espionage roll to be made to open a lock, and also provide a bonus to said roll. That bonus has a maximum of +5, or the user's Espionage skill ranks, whichever is lower; you have to actually know how to use them to get any benefit. These are reusable, though a roll of 5 or lower on the Espionage check means they break in the attempt (which may still be successful).\n  -  Cost: 100 Ryo per +1\n\n\n#### f.  Ninja Comm Device\nThe pinnacle of technological advancement in the ninja world, these are small wireless radios. They're typically worn as headsets with an ear insert and a microphone held suspended near the wearer's mouth. Normal comm devices can be tuned to transmit and receive on any of a dozen frequencies by the user, allowing any set of devices to be synchronized with one another. Though each village also has a few sets of specially made comm devices built to operate on &quot;secure&quot; frequencies, these are not typically given to shinobi on missions.\n\nCommonly used in missions that require precise coordination or infiltration, these always receive, and are touch-activated to broadcast. They have a range of half a mile. Be aware that while these are generally a secure means of communication, it's (theoretically) possible for enemies to find your frequency if you're making continual use of the comms, they know you're using them, and they're actively trying to do so.\n\nIf you suffer a Major or greater Head wound while wearing a comm device, it breaks as a result of the damage. A comm device broken this way is too badly damaged to be repaired, and will need to be replaced.\n  -  Cost: 500 Ryo ; 1000 Ryo for 2-mile radius\n\n\n#### g.  Telescope\nA small pocket telescope, which telescopes out from two inches to close to six. It allows you to effectively see what's going on up to five hundred yards away, and read reasonably-sized text (assuming you have clear line of sight) up to a hundred yards away. Mechanically, this means that any Awareness rolls at a distance up to its maximum (to, say, see when a guard leaves his post) have no penalty.\n  -  Cost: 200 Ryo\n  ># Poisons \n   1. Rules\n   a.

Wandering Spider\n   o. Box Jellyfish\n   p. Water Hemlock\n   q. Stonefish\n   r. Blue-Ringed Octopus\n   s. Golden Dart Frog\n\nPoisons are nasty business, and one of the murkier aspects of ninja tactics. Certainly, before the days when shinobi had discovered the secrets of chakra manipulation, poisons were a vital part of their arsenal. The proper use of poisons, however, is hard to learn, and in most circumstances just isn't as useful as being able to shoot fireballs and run up walls.\n\nSome ninja, however, still find uses for them. This section is for them!\n\n====================\n1. Rules\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Doses\nPoisons are measured in doses. Each poison has a listed price. The first dose costs that much; subsequent doses cost half that much, each. This is, essentially, a limit on how many times you can use that poison before running out.\n\nEach poison has a listed Toxicology rating. Your Toxicology skill ranks must be a minimum of that much to use that poison.\n\n\n#### b.  Melee Weapons\nOne dose of poison is enough to coat the business end of a weapon. You can apply up to 1+(Toxicology)/10 doses worth of poison to a weapon as a single Speed 10 action. Each time the weapon hits something, it loses one dose. If you apply a new poison to the weapon (even another dose of the same type), any remaining poison of the previous dose is wiped away.\n\\page\n\n\n\n#### c.  Thrown Weapons\nA single dose of poison can coat two thrown weapons. Like melee weapons, a thrown weapon does not lose its poison coating unless it actually hits something or someone. A thrown weapon may hold only a single dose of a poison; applying a new poison wipes away the old.\n\n\n#### d.  Types of Poison\nPoisons have four possible vectors: Contact, Injury, Inhalation, and Ingestion. Contact poisons can be applied to any blunt or slashing weapon, while Injury poisons can be applied to slashing or piercing weapons.\n\nWhenever you're hit by a weapon with Contact poison, or damaged by one with Injury poison, you roll Resistance against the poison user's Toxicology. If you fail this roll (which does receive the benefits or partial defense), you have been poisoned. You're afflicted by the poisons status effects (Poison of some value, and sometimes other effects, described in the individual poison) for its Duration. If partial defense applies, it reduces the Duration, not the severity.\n\nIngestion poisons are effectively useless in combat, but can be used to lace someone's food. Inhalation poisons can only be used effectively by deploying Poison Smoke Bombs.\n\nNo matter how many poisons you're afflicted by, their effects do not stack. Thus, if you had Poison 4 for Duration 25, and Poison 2 for Duration 50, you would take 4 damage per initiative count for 25 IC, and then for the next 25 you'd take 2 damage per IC. Any additional effects apply regardless, as long as they don't overlap (Paralysis 1 and Paralysis 3 is just Paralysis 3, as normal).\n\n\n#### e.  Identifying Poisons\nWhen you or someone else has been poisoned, it's possible to identify the venom just based on the symptoms. You may do so after 1/10 of the poison's total duration has passed. At that point, you can roll a Research, Toxicology, or Medicine skill check (your preference) against 20 + the poison's Toxicology rating. Success means you've identified the poison.\n\nIf you fail, you may take a Speed 6 action afterwards to try to identify the symptoms, which you may repeat as many times as you like.\n\n====================\n2. Poisons\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Centipede (Injury, Contact)\nGiant centipedes aren't actually all that venomous, though their venom causes significant discomfort, and a pervasive sensation of weakness. Centipede venom cannot harm HP, only Vitality. A person afflicted has their physical damage bonus reduced by (0.5, +0.1 for every two points they failed their Resistance roll by) for the rest of the day, even if the poison is cured. However, centipede venom has a -2 penalty to the Toxicology roll used to inflict it. Multiple damage bonus penalties from centipede venom don't stack; the highest one replaces any lower ones.\n   Poison: 1\n   Duration: 75\n   Toxicology: 3\n   Cost: 50\n```\n```\n\n\n\n#### b.  Black Adder (Injury)\nSnake poison, and not a particularly troublesome variety of it. There's intense pain and significant swelling at the point of contact, but that's the worst of it. Hours afterwards, there will be a lingering, full-body pain, but nothing life-threatening. However, your Toxicology roll to poison a person with this has a +3 bonus.\n   Poison: 1\n   Duration: 100\n   Toxicology: 6\n   Cost: 80\n\n<img \n  src='http://www.herpetofauna.co.uk/forum/uploads/herpetologic2/2006-02-20_063830_black_adder_1.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \n#### c.  Yew (Injury, Ingested)\nOnly relatively dangerous in its normal form, the yew's toxin has proven its value to ninja by being versatile, easily refined, and easy to get ahold of. Unlike poisonous animals, trees don't tend to be small or wander around. While poisoned, any time your Stamina penalty increases, it increases by an additional 2 points.\n   Poison: 1\n   Duration: 100\n   Toxicology: 6\n   Cost: 120\n\n\n#### d.  Bark Scorpion (Injury)\nStings from the bark scorpion aren't typically fatal; ninja weaponizing the venom distill it to improve the lethality. Despite being exceptionally painful at the point of entry, it's not likely to kill someone, though the lingering numbness and spasms are certainly unpleasant to deal with.\n   Poison: 1\n   Immobilization: 2\n   Duration: 100\n   Toxicology: 9\n   Cost: 180\n\n\n#### e.  Cone Snail (Injury, Contact)\nA family of brightly-colored, excitingly-patterned snails, the worst of these produce a venom which is a compound of hundreds of different toxins. Aside from pain and swelling at the point of impact, the venom can easily cause respiratory failure.\n\nThere is no antidote to cone snail venom. If you've been poisoned, when your Fatigue levels increases your Stamina penalty is halved, rather than being reset to 0. You may not Rest or lower your Stamina penalty in other ways.\n   Poison: 1\n   Duration: 150\n   Toxicology: 9\n   Cost: 200\n\n\n#### f.  Deathstalker Scorpion (Injury)\nDespite the name, one of the world's most venomous scorpions isn't all that lethal to humans. As with most scorpions, being envenomated is excruciatingly painful, far out of proportion to the actual threat posed.\n   Poison: 2\n   Paralysis: 1\n   Duration: 75\n   Toxicology: 12\n   Cost: 200\n\n\\page\n\n\n#### g.  Death Cap (Ingested)\nThe death cap is one of, if not the, most poisonous mushrooms in the world. Mercifully, there's no way to process it into a weaponized form. In addition to its Poison rating, every 10 IC which pass a victim loses 1 point of RES. These recover at the rate of 1 per week which passes (double with medical treatment). Someone who reaches 0 RES simply dies.\n   Poison: 1\n   Duration: 500\n   Toxicology: 12\n   Cost: 300\n\n\n#### h.  Brown Recluse (Injury)\nA shy, tiny spider, the brown recluse none the less has an especially dangerous venom, especially to civilians; to shinobi, it's only severely threatening. The poison is slow-acting, but still dangerous.\n   Poison: 1\n   Duration: 700\n   Toxicology: 15\n   Cost: 300\n\n\n#### i.  Black Widow (Injury)\nThis infamous little spider's venom has quite the unpleasant, and largely well-deserved, reputation. For the poison's duration, your Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls all suffer from a -4 penalty.\n   Poison: 2\n   Immobilize: 3\n   Duration: 150\n   Toxicology: 15\n   Cost: 300\n\n\n#### j.  Wolfsbane (Injury, Ingestion)\nA poisonous plant known also as monkshood, the least of one's worries are a severe burning sensation at the point of injury, the abdomen, and the face. The more severe ones are staving off paralysis of one's heart and lungs.\n\nWolfsbane has a -2 penalty to its Toxicology rolls if delivered through injury, or +4 if by ingestion. When poisoned by Wolfsbane, your Stamina rolls use the higher of your Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion penalty, and your Chakra Exhaustion rolls use the higher of your Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion penalty.\n   Poison: 4\n   Duration: 125\n   Toxicology: 18\n   Cost: 350\n\n\n#### k.  Manchineel Tree (Contact, Injury, Ingestion, Inhalation)\nNothing about this tree isn't inimical to human life. The sap and bark are poisonous, the fruit is absurdly toxic, the leaves are sufficient to poison water supplies. Tying people to the tree overnight is a brutal, highly effective method of execution. In practice, ninja use the sap as a toxin, as it keeps best.\n\nEnvenomation results in severe full-body irritation and shortness of breath. It's painfully distracting enough to inflict a -2 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls, and inflicts its Suffocation effect every 10 IC.\n   Poison: 3\n   Suffocation: 1\n   Duration: 150\n   Toxicology: 18\n   Cost: 350\n\n\n#### l.  King Cobra (Injury)\nOne of the world's deadliest snakes, the king cobra's venom is a neurotoxin that quickly leads to blurred vision, disorientation, and muscular paralysis. While poisoned, you have a -4 penalty to all skill rolls other than Resistance, and a -5 penalty to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls. King cobra venom has a +3 bonus to its Toxicology rolls.\n   Poison: 2\n   Paralysis: 3\n   Duration: 200\n   Toxicology: 22\n   Cost: 500\n\n```\n```\n\n\n#### m.  Belladona (Injury, Ingestion)\nAlso known as devil's berries, belladona's poison causes delirium, hallucinations, and weakness. For its duration, your physical damage bonus is halved. Anyone is able to hide from you, regardless of your visibility penalty, if they double the Speed of their Hide action, though in this case you get a +5 bonus to your Awareness roll. If eaten, its Poison value is doubled.\n   Poison: 2\n   Visibility: -4\n   Duration: 200\n   Toxicology: 22\n   Cost: 400\n\n\n#### n.  Wandering Spider (Injury)\nNot only is it one of the most dangerous spiders, it's one of the most aggressive ones, and won't hesitate to attack humans. The venom is a neurotoxin\n\nWhile poisoned you suffer from -3 Accuracy. Any time your Chakra penalty increases, your Stamina penalty increases by half that much, and vice versa.\n   Poison: 4\n   Duration: 100\n   Toxicology: 26\n   Cost: 450\n\n\n#### o.  Box Jellyfish (Injury, Contact)\nThough they're not the deadliest of sea creature, they're what most people will imagine when thinking of that. Affliction with this venom results in convulsions, and before long will send a victim into shock.\n\nThe convulsions make it exceptionally difficult to act. You can't take any action with a base Speed of 20 or higher, -1 for every 5 points you failed the Toxicology roll by.\n   Poison: 3\n   Paralysis: 1\n   Duration: 150\n   Toxicology: 26\n   Cost: 450\n\n\n#### p.  Water Hemlock (Contact, Ingestion)\nThere are multiple varieties of hemlock, with this being by far the most unpleasant. The plant's sufficiently lethal that coming into contact with it purely by accident in the wild can cause death. It's a powerful stimulant, leading to intense pain, tremors, disorientation, dizziness, fever, hallucinations, tingling, dilated pupils, respiratory difficulty...\n\nWhile poisoned, you have a -4 penalty to Resistance and Awareness rolls.\n   Poison: 4\n   Visibility: -5\n   Duration: 200\n   Toxicology: 30\n   Cost: 500\n\n\n#### q.  Stonefish (Injury)\nThe most venomous fish in the world, it's commonly agreed upon that having an injured limb amputated is less agonizing than enduring the pain. Though there will be a slow necrosis of flesh around the injury, the real risk is quite immediate.\n   Poison: 6\n   Duration: 100\n   Toxicology: 30\n   Cost: 500\n\n\n#### r.  Blue-Ringed Octopus (Injury)\nA small, unimposing creature, it's still one of the world's most deadly animals. Its venom is a cocktail of more than a dozen toxins that will kill within minutes. Thankfully they're rare, as no antidote exists.\n\nIf one does have the misfortune of being poisoned, this poison inflicts its Suffocation effect every 10 IC. Continual first aid provided by someone else (specifically, forced respiration) will prevent the Suffocation and Poison damage from being inflicted while it's maintained.\n   Poison 3\n   Paralysis 8\n   Suffocation 2\n   Duration 200\n   Toxicology: 35\n   Cost: N/A\n\n\\page\n<img \n  src='http://www.ryanphotographic.com/images/JPEGS/Platymantis%20vitiensis%20yellow%20morph%202.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n#### s.  Golden Dart Frog (Injury, Contact)\nA rare, deadly animal only known to be native to Rain Country, the golden dart frog's poison is so potent that most stories about it are believed to be exaggerations. The venom can remain potent for more than two years, and simply touching a surface the frog has crossed can be enough for small animals to perish.\n\nAttempts have been made to raise the animal in captivity, and failed. The common theory is that some part of their diet is what makes the poison coating their skin so deadly. That, combined with their rarity, makes this poison exceptionally difficult to come by--which is a good thing. It shuts down the nervous system, leading to numbness, paralysis, and ultimately heart failure.\n   Poison: 10\n   Paralysis: 4\n   Immobilize: 5\n   Duration: 100\n   Toxicology: 35\n   Cost: N/A (the antidote is 500 Ryo per dose\n   \n   ># Equipment by Rank\n1.

Forehead Protector\nA rectangular piece of metal with your village's emblem prominently engraved. When worn on the forehead, it blocks the effects of the first Minor head wound you receive, but is knocked off in the process.\n  -  Cost: Free\n```\n```\n\n\n\n#### b.  Exploding Tag\n\nRectangular slips of paper inscribed with special seals, centered around the kanji for &quot;explode&quot;. They're infused with chakra, but normally inert. A tag can be &quot;primed&quot; by focusing a small amount of chakra into them, at which point they can stick to most surfaces (like walls, or the underside of bridges; tags cannot be attached to people) and are ready to be detonated; this doesn't take an action.\n\nDetonating a tag is a Chakra 5, Speed 10 action which requires you to physically touch the tag in question. You may set it to detonate anywhere between 10 and (10 + your ranks in the Chakra Control skill) IC afterwards. When a tag is on its 'countdown' it begins sparking, smoking, and sizzling distinctively; any shinobi will realize that it's about to go off.\n\nFire will not cause tags to explode, nor will they explode in a &quot;chain reaction&quot;. A tag that is blown up or burnt, even a primed one, is just destroyed.\n\nTags do 5d20.open(10) damage, in Area 20. If multiple tags are set off on the same IC (and someone is hit by them all), their damage is combined for determining what wounds they inflict; explosions inflict Blunt wounds.\n\nWhen detonated, tags count as a Speed 8+2 per tags attack that cannot be made faster by any means. This uses your base accuracy, gaining no bonuses from anything, and anyone caught in the explosion incurs a -5 dodge penalty, with an additional -2 penalty per tag in the explosion and they add half of your NDB to their damage. However, anyone who escapes their area before they explode automatically avoids all damage.\n\nCertain jutsu may cause tags, in which the target must defend against the projectile as well as the explosives when appropriate.\n  -  Cost: 100 Ryo\n  \\page\n\n\n\n====================\n#### 2. Chuunin\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Flak Vest\nOften referred to as 'chuunin vests', these are what many a genin strives to be allowed to wear. There's a jounin version as well, slightly different in appearance but functionally identical.\n\nAny time your torso or abdomen would be wounded, the vest reduces the wound's severity by 1, and the final damage by 25 (after determining if you're wounded). The next time, this damage reduction is 20; then 15, and so forth. When the damage reduction reaches 0, the vest is damaged too badly to provide any protection and no longer reduces the severity of your wounds.\n  -  Cost: 400 Ryo\n\n\n#### b.  Custom Smoke Bombs\nOnce someone's a chuunin, they have enough pull to get these: smoke bombs designed to your own specifications! Very nice, and such. For pricing, first determine the 'level' of smoke bomb you want, which starts at 0 and is modified by...\nVisibility Penalty: -4 (+0), -6 (+2), or -8 (+3)\nDuration: 5 IC (+1), 10 IC (+2), 15 IC (+3), or 20 IC (+5)\nRadius: 5 yards (+1), 10 yards (+2), or 25 yards (+3)\nRange: STR/5 yards (+0), STR/4 yards (+1), or STR/3 yards (+2)\n  -  Cost: Level*10 Ryo\n\n\n#### c.  Exploding Tag, Type 2\nA more powerful version of the regular exploding tags, not given to genin because experience has shown, time and again, that genin really can't be trusted with high-end explosives.\n\nChuunin, however, are more responsible--at least, in theory. Therefore, they get to play with the big explosions! Type 2 tags function identically to regular exploding tags more regards, though the deal 7d20.open(10) damage and have an Area of 30. Additionally, they deal double damage to inanimate objects (such as walls, but not including jutsu-based defenses).\n  -  Cost: 250 Ryo\n\n====================\n3. Jounin\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Hand Guards\nGloves (often fingerless) with a metal plate covering the back of the hand. These allow you to parry weapon attacks unarmed; however, if you do so, any wounds (if you fail) will be applied to your hands (or arms, or whatever, as appropriate for the rank of the wounds).\n\nThat said, the first two times you're wounded doing this, the wound's severity is reduced one rank. The second time that happens, the guard on the back of that glove will be broken. Thus, if you wear both gloves (100 Ryo pays for a pair), you could do it a total of four times.\n\nYou may also block with these guards, with the same wound location and severity effects. This allows you to block weapons without reducing blocking's effectiveness.\n  -  Cost: 100 Ryo\n\n\n#### b.  Exploding Tag, Type 3\nThe end-all and be-all of 'mundane' explosives, reserved for jounin simply because of how difficult they are to produce, which is in turn reflected in how troublesome they are to get ahold of.\n\nType 3, like Type 2, deal double damage to inanimate objects. They deal 10d20.open(10) damage, and have an Area of 50.\n  -  Cost: 500 Ryo\n\n\n====================\n4. ANBU\n------------------------------\n\n#### ANBU Mask\nHand-crafted white ceramic masks featuring mono- or bichromatic lines that make the mask resemble some kind of animal's face. Technically there's nothing preventing you from changing what animal it is each time you replace the mask, but most ANBU members stick with a single choice and use it as a distinguishing feature.\n\nANBU masks reduce the severity of head wounds by one rank, a total of three times before being made useless. The mask does crack, break, and fall off during this process.\n  -  Cost: 200 Ryo\n\n\n#### ANBU Cloak\nHigh-quality cloaks that wrap around a user's body to obscure them from the shoulders down. They're practically waterproof, and do a great job of keeping out the rain. Stains--especially blood!--come right out in the wash!\n\nOnce per 100 IC you can make an automatic surprise attack with any Small-size weapon, drawing it as a Speed 0 action, as long as you haven't used that weapon previously in the fight.\n\nThey come in black (for most ANBU) and white (for captains). Most ANBU captains stick with the black anyway since it looks better. They're ANBU captains, they do what they want.\n  -  Cost: 200 Ryo\n\n\\page\n\n\n====================\n5. Kage\n------------------------------\n\n#### Kage Hat\nEvery village's Kage has a distinctive hat to go with their formal Kage's robes. It's diamond-shaped with a pointed top, sloping low enough to keep the sun from their eyes and occasionally accompanied by a headdress to obscure the sides of their head. If worn properly, it can also obscure the upper half of their face from view, which looks really cool.\n\nThe hat is mostly a color corresponding to the country the Kage is from, with a white portion at the front and a kanji indicating their country of origin in the dominant color in that section.\n\nWhile not useful in combat, it is a VERY nice hat.\n  -  Cost: Priceless\n\n\n#### Kage Robes\nFormal attire for Kages, mostly white and off-white, with the lower half (and some highlights on the upper half) being a color corresponding to the village. They look bulky, but they actually breathe very well! The robes are exceptionally comfortable, and while not stylish they tend to swish and swoosh dramatically.\n\nThe robes impose a -3 penalty on accuracy, dodge rolls, and Athletics checks. However, because Kages are totally badass they can shed these robes as a Speed -2 Interrupt. And yes, that's a negative sign there.\n\n```\n```\n\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://kit168.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/5-kage-hats-naruto-kit168.com_.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\nWhat a sexy hat!

Spending Experience Points\n   a. Attributes\n   b. Abilities\n   c. Jutsu\n   d. Other\n3. Experience Bonuses\n\n\n====================\n1. Gaining Experience Points\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Roleplay\nRoleplay is interacting with others while playing as your character. Do note that this does have to be with other people; playing with yourself may be fun, but claiming you should be rewarded for it is just silly.\n\nEvery half hour of in-character activity awards 2 XP.  You must remain reasonably active throughout this. Thus, if you were playing for an hour and a half, but had to take a twenty-minute break in the middle for whatever reason, you would get 4 XP, counting only the hour and ten minutes during which you were actually RPing.\n\nWhen in doubt, use common sense.\n\n\n#### b.  Combat\nAs highly-trained (well, in theory), supernaturally-powered fighters, ninja can learn a lot from combat, testing their abilities against one another. Most of the time this is (semi-)friendly practice rounds, or spars. Sometimes it's, well... not.\n\nYou get 2 XP for every 30 minutes the fight lasts, though you do not accumulate RP XP during that time. Additionally, you may receive bonus XP for your fight depending on how things went. Consult the lists below!\n\n  Bonuses:\n+1 per Fatigue level you end the battle at, to a maximum of +5\n+2 for every Major wound you acquire\n+4 for every Severe wound you acquire\n+6 for every Critical wound you acquire\n\n  Penalties:\n-2 per Fatigue level you begin the battle at\n-1 per Wound (regardless of level) you start the battle with\n\nAfter fighting someone, you may not gain XP for fighting that person for 24 hours. If you, however, are in a spar with them and other people (who you haven't fought in the past 24 hours) you will still gain XP for it.\n\n\n#### c.  Events\nAlthough the game revolves around the PCs, the world they're in does not. Things are constantly going on off-screen, separate from casual role playing. Sometimes, GMs will make this known through an event.\n\nThese are often missions which the characters are sent on by their village, with clearly defined objectives such as delivering an item or protecting a person. However, this is by no means the only type of event.\n\nYou do not get XP for RPing during events, nor do you get XP for any combat which takes place as part of one. Instead, the GM who ran the event will tell you how much XP you have earned.\n\n\n#### d.  Training\nIt's assumed that your ninja keeps themselves busy somehow when off-screen. Maybe they're doing missions for their village, maybe they actually training, or maybe they're just laying in a hospital bed reflecting on their mistakes. Realistically, however, you're not going to go over all these things when playing the game; after all, your character is always a ninja, but you have a real life to worry about.\n\nWhatever the reason, your character gets a small amount of XP for each day the game's been going, representing this; with the way this works, it also helps characters made later in the game catch up.\n\nBecause it can get a bit convoluted (but look on the bright side: free XP!) this has its own node; check &quot;Training&quot;, also in Chapter 9, for details.\n\n\n#### e.  Other\nYou may get XP in some other fashion. Usually, this will involve a GM telling you how much you got, and for what reason.\n\n<img \n  src='https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/narutoprofile/images/e/ed/Demon_Wind_Shuriken.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121209061644' \n  style='width:325px' />\nPlease do not use Fuumas in training against fellow mist ninja, we will take your swords! Leaf ninja who are sex offenders are fine. - Office of the Mizukage\n\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n2. Spending Experience Points\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Attributes\nXP can be spent to increase any of your five basic attributes. Starting out, the cost to do this is 4 XP per 1 point in any single attribute.\n\nThe primary restriction on this is the poorly-named 'rule of 3'. What this means is: the amount you have increased an attribute may not be more than 3 points higher than the next-highest amount you have increased an attribute by.\n\nBecause an example will make it clearer: You could raise your STR by 3 points (for 12 XP). To raise it to 4 points, a single other attribute would need to have been raised by at least 1, for a total of (4+1)*4 = 20 XP.\n\nSay you had raised your STR and RES by 12 each, your CHA by 9, your AGI by 6, and your DEX by 3. You could raise your STR or your RES to 15 right away, but to raise both of them to 13 you'd need to raise your DEX, AGI, and CHA by 1 each (in that order).\n\nAnd, to be clear, only the amount you have raised an attribute by using XP matters; its starting value, or bonuses from uniques (or any other sources), is not part of this limit.\n\nAside from that restriction, raising attributes summons from a degree of diminishing returns. The first 50 points in an attribute cost, as stated, 4 XP; the next 50 cost 5 XP per +1, the next 50 cost 6 XP per +1, and so forth. Thus, to raise your STR by 62 points you would have to spend a total of (50*4 + 12*5) = 260 XP... not counting what you'd have to spend on other attributes to satisfy the 'rule of 3'.\n\nFinally, you may spend no more than half your total XP on stats. So, if you had 1000 XP, you could spend no more 500 XP on raising your stat points.\n\n\n#### b.  Abilities\nThe full details of spending XP to learn abilities are discussed in Chapter 4. But, in brief: it varies from one ability to another, with the costs being listed in individual abilities.\n\n\n#### c.  Jutsu\nA ninja who intends to be successful would do well to have a wide variety of techniques at their disposal. The actual restrictions on what you can and can't learn are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Once you meet the requirements to acquire a jutsu you want, to learn (or 'purchase') it you spend an amount of XP determined by its rank, as listed... below:\n\nE: 6\nD: 8\nC: 12\nB: 24\nA: 48\n\n\n#### d. Other\nAnything else you can spend XP on will likely explain the rules for doing so in its description.\n\n\n====================\n3. Experience Bonuses\n------------------------------\n\nClanless characters, and certain clans (which will say so in their description), get what is called an experience bonus. This is an amount beyond your Total XP which you can spend.\n\nExperience Bonuses are given in percents--for example, Clanless characters have a 10% XP Bonus. Take, for example, a clanless character who's earned 100 XP from RP, 100 from fighting, and 23 from events, on top of his starting 100 XP. This means that his Total XP is 323, just like any normal character.\n\nHowever, he also has a 10% XP bonus; this means that his bonus XP is 32. Thus, in his Spent XP log (you'll read more about logs later in this chapter) he would record XP Total as 323, &quot;XP Bonus (__%)&quot; as 32 (and change the __% to 10%), and &quot;Total + Bonus&quot; as (323+32) 355.\n\nYour total amount of XP spent can go up to your Total + Bonus.\n\nHowever, your bonus is not actually part of your Total XP. Many things are based on your Total XP, such as bonuses to Genjutsu rolls, your Skill Points, and Talents. XP bonuses have no effect on these\n\\page\n\n\n># Training\n1. Late Creation\n2. Normal Training\n3. Eventually...\n\n====================\n1. Late Creation\n------------------------------\n\nBecause of this game's constantly-ongoing nature, a lot of people will join after it starts; also, you might get tired of a character and make a new one. Training gives 3 XP a day, every day a character exists (see &quot;Normal Training&quot; below), which would leave this people at a disadvantage. For example, if you join 100 days into the game, everyone would have 300 XP more than you.\n\nHowever, there's a system in place to deal with this. Essentially, you can &quot;earn&quot; all that XP you missed out on by playing the game. The way it works is a little complicated, but please bear with us--and look on the bright side, it means you get more XP!\n\n\nThe first thing you need to do, when you make your character, is type get_days on the server. This will return you a message saying something like, &quot;12 days have passed since the beginning of the game.&quot; That's your Creation Day (because the game started on day 0). You record this on your character sheet, in Logs -&gt; XP Logs -&gt; Training. It goes in the empty box on the &quot;Creation Day&quot; row.\n\nNext, you calculate &quot;Missed XP&quot;; this is your Creation Day, multiplied by 3. In other words, it's the amount of training XP you would have received if you'd made on day 0.\n\nThe way the system works is that you get that missed XP by playing. For every 1 point of XP you earn normally (through RP, fighting, or events--as discussed in the &quot;Experience Points&quot; node), you earn 1 additional point of XP, until you've received all your Missed XP this way. That can be complicated, so please, keep reading--a mostly error-proof way of figuring this out follows.\n\n\nStill in your Training Log, your &quot;Earned XP&quot; row has the total of all the XP you gained from RP, fights, and events; just use the totals from those sections (or your Total XP log) and add them together. This is mostly just for reference.\n\nNext is &quot;Claimed XP&quot;; this is the lower of your Missed XP or Earned XP. To reiterate, in case there was any confusion, this can never go above your Missed XP. Once they're equal, that means you've &quot;gotten back&quot; all the training you missed out on by starting late.\n\n&quot;Remaining&quot; is also just for reference; it lets you know how much more &quot;double XP&quot; you have available.\n\n\n====================\n2. Normal Training\n------------------------------\n\nAs mentioned above, you get 3 XP for every day your character exists. You do not, however, need to buy a calendar just for this game!\n\nWhen you type get_days on the server, you'll see how many days have passed since the game began. If you subtract your Creation Day (discussed above) from this number, that is how many Training Days you get (filled out in your Training Log). Multiplying that by 3 is your Training XP.\n\nSo, if you made on day 100, and it was currently day 124, you would have (124 - 100) 24 days of training. This would give you (24 * 3) 72 XP.\n\n\nFinally, combine your Claimed XP and Training XP; this will go in the row labeled &quot;Total.&quot;\n\n\n====================\n3. Eventually...\n------------------------------\n\nAfter you have the maximum amount of Training XP--that is, your &quot;Remaining&quot; row is 0, after everything has been properly filled out--you can delete your Training Log.\n\n1. Academy Student\n2. Genin\n3. Chuunin\n4. Jounin\n5. Special Jounin\n6. ANBU\n7. Missing Nin\n8. Sennin\n9. Kage\n\nNo matter what ranks or combination of ranks you obtain, you may only acquire a total of 4 Unique Points from ranking up. Thus, if you were promoted to Chuunin, then to Special Jounin, and later transferred to full Jounin status, you would have 2+1+2 = 5 -&gt; +4 UP from your rank.\n\n====================\n1. Academy Student\n------------------------------\n\nEvery ninja village has its own ninja academy. It's a lot like you might expect a modern grade school to be, except instead of learning math the students learn how to mold chakra, and instead of mandatory sports programs there are mandatory mock battles.\n\nThe ethics of training children of single-digit ages to be effective killing machines is dubious at best; however, it's been shown that shinobi who begin training from a young age (younger than 10, older than 6, is the typical rule of thumb; any younger and they risk stunting their development) have significantly higher potential than those who begin later.\n\nPlayers do not begin as academy students, though it's presumed that their character was one beforehand, and only recently graduated. The rank is included here for the sake of completion.\n\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n2. Genin\n------------------------------\n\nAfter graduating from their village's Ninja Academy students are promoted to the rank of Genin. This is when they're given a forehead protector with their village's emblem, worn to identify them as ninja. They're also entered into their village's Ninja Registry for identification purposes.\n\nAt the rank of Genin they will finally begin performing actual missions for the village, usually of E- and D-rank, though sometimes higher with supervision. Genin are trusted to go on missions outside of their village.\n\nWhile genin are typically the weakest ninja in their village, it's a rank, not a measurement of power. It's quite possible for a genin to be more powerful than their superiors.\n\n\nGenin can learn E-rank Taijutsu and Ninjutsu techniques.\n\n====================\n3. Chuunin\n------------------------------\n\nChuunin are shinobi who have proven themselves capable leaders within their village, able to coordinate effective strategies during missions and make intelligent decisions for themselves and others, and make up the bulk of the village's combat-ready forces.\n\nThe villages organize a semi-annual Chuunin Exam, with candidates from all villages participating. This is used both for the ninja involved to prove their worthiness of advancement, but also as a way for the village to show off the talents of their shinobi; Chuunin Exams are relatively public affairs, with many nobles and potential employers attending.\n\nWhile rare, at times exceptional shinobi will demonstrate their ability consistently in missions and other situations, and the village will choose to promote them without waiting for them to pass the Chuunin Exams.\n\nChuunin are all issued, and most choose to wear, special flak jackets when they're promoted. These identify them as qualified as shinobi, and for many ninja wearing one is point of pride. Some opt not to, instead preferring more distinct robes or capes.\n\n\nPromotion Requirements:\n -  Be able to use D-rank Taijutsu and Ninjutsu.\n -  Pass the Chuunin Exams.\n\nChuunin have access to C-rank taijutsu and ninjutsu techniques. Upon promotion to Chuunin, you gain 2 Unique Points.\n\n\n====================\n4. Jounin\n------------------------------\n\nConsidered the elite ninja of the village, Jounin are ninja who prove themselves exceptionally capable shinobi.  Jounin Exams do exist, but they are not as public or prestigious as Chuunin exams, which are meant to be a show to the country's daimyo of that village's potential.  They are sent on high-priority A- and S-rank missions, regularly dealing with life-threatening situations.\n\nJounin are often given squads of Genin to lead, training the next generation as they had once done for them.  While it varies between villages just how important this process is, usuually a genin's sensei is a lasting confidante and, at times, someone to measure themselves against.\n\n\nPromotion Requirements:\n -  Be a Chuunin.\n -  Never inflict a critical on a fellow village shinobi during training.\n -  Be able to use D-rank Genjutsu.\n -  Pass a Jounin exam or be selected for advancement.\n\nJounin have access to B-rank techniques. When you're promoted to Jounin to receive 2 Unique Points, and may choose two of the following rank benefits.\n\n====================\n5. Special Jounin\n------------------------------\n\nSpecial jounin occupy distinguished positions in their village; Genin and Chuunin typically think the rank is 'below' jounin, while most jounin respect a special jounin's expertise.\n\nEvery special jounin has one field in which they excel. When someone thinks of a special jounin they typically imagine interrogators, trackers, and med nin, though many work behind the scenes as strategists and administrators (a few of them even have fearsome custom administrative ninjutsu techniques).\n\nSometimes Jounin are promoted laterally to Special Jounin status; similarly, ANBU may temporarily or permanently 'retire' due to the psychological stress of their work, and become Special Jounin so that the village can still use their talents. It's even possible for Chuunin to be promoted directly for Special Jounin status, if their skills are valuable enough but their overall performance doesn't merit Jounin status.\n\n\nPromotion Requirements:\n -  Be selected based on your specialized skills.\n -  Already be Chuunin or higher rank.\n\nSpecial Jounin have access to C-rank techniques. Additionally, for a single category (such as Medical Ninjutsu) they have access to B- and A-ranked techniques.\n\nUpon promotion, Special Jounin receive 1 additional Unique Point to spend.\n\\page\n\n\n\n\n====================\n6. ANBU\n------------------------------\n\nThe black ops division of every village, ANBU (Ansatsu Senjutsu Tokushu Butai) are the most elite, competent, and ruthless of their peers. They serve as the Kage's bodyguards, and are entrusted with the most sensitive missions. ANBU identify themselves (or, rather, hide their identities) by wearing a unique face mask, white with a pattern in some secondary color to make the mask resemble some type of animal.\n\nIn terms of skill and power, ANBU are comparable to jounin. The difference is the kind of missions they are assigned. ANBU are promoted with personal approval from the Kage, and are among the most loyal and dedicated shinobi of their village.\n\nThey're also the ones most likely to be sent on high-profile infiltration and assassination missions. Being ANBU is a mixed blessing: they don't really have any more authority within their own village, and while they are respected by their peers there's also a certain stigma attached to ANBU.\n\n\nPromotion Requirements:\n -  Be a REAL Ninja.\n\nANBU have access to B-rank jutsu, and access to A-rank jutsu of a single category (such as Combo Taijutsu). ANBU members receive 1 Unique Point.\n\n====================\n7. Missing Nin\n------------------------------\n\nNot actually a rank, but rather a status. This is the term applied to ninja who have deserted their village (&quot;gone missing&quot;) for one reason or another. Missing nin are, in simplest terms, traitors. Most villages will, once they realize one of their ninja has fled, promptly add that person to their Bingo Books and, if the reason they left was sufficiently severe, or if they knew village secrets, dispatch ANBU teams to hunt them down and either bring them back to the village or kill them.\n\nSome missing nin may defect to other villages. However, even if they're allowed to (many villages will accept, and then promptly imprison the traitor) they are generally treated poorly and disrespected--once a traitor, always a traitor, and in the shinobi world loyalty is one of the most valuable traits a person can have.\n\n\nRequirements:\n -  Desert your village. Harder than it sounds...\n\nRank benefits:\n - So, I've got good news, and I've got bad news...\n -  The good news: You're your own boss! Nobody can tell you what to do!\n -  The bad news: Your village wants you dead or captured, and everyone else wants the bounty your village put on your head.\n\n====================\n8. Sennin\n------------------------------\n\nCalling this a rank is dubious, at best. Certainly, it's not an official one. These are ninja who've reached a great level of distinction in their village for reasons other than power in combat, but who are also skilled enough to be more than a match for most other ninja in battle.\n\nMost sennin serve as personal advisors to the kage, and potential stand-ins for the kage; many sennin would be suitable kages (though perhaps not powerful enough, yet), if not for personal issues, such as aversion to authority or a strong preference for field work.\n\nSennin are often give free reign to leave their village and undertake long-term personal missions--one of the defining characteristics of them is that they're implicitly trusted by their village to such an extent.\n\n\nRank benefits:\n -  You can come and go from your village as you please, without being labelled as a missing nin. However, you're still expected to answer to the Kage, and not to act against your village's interests.\n\n====================\n9. Kage\n------------------------------\n\nThe highest rank attainable in any of the major shinobi villages is that of Kage: the lead ninja in the village. Officially, only the leaders of the Five Great Ninja Villages are recognized as Kages: Raikage (Cloud), Hokage (Leaf), Mizukage (Mist), Kazekage (Sand), and Tsuchikage (Stone). The leaders of Otogakure have taken to styling themselves as the Otokages, though they are not officially realized as such.\n\nA village's Kage is not an autocrat; they are still accountable to their village's ruling council. However, the Kage is also more than a figurehead. They are one of the village's most powerful shinobi, but also one who knows when to listen to others and respect the needs of their people.\n\nThough most Genin entertain dreams of one day becoming their respective village's Kage, they generally manage to outgrow those desires. Being Kage is hard work, and typically painfully dull to the ones capable of doing it well (many Kages have infamously short tempers for paperwork).\n\nA Kage can either be appointed as successor by their predecessor, or nominated by the village council. Once they've taken the position, a Kage technically holds the title for life; most step down in their later years and let a younger shinobi take over, remaining Kage in name only.\n\n\n\\page\n# Rank Benefits\n1. Chuunin\n2. Jounin\n3. Special Jounin\n4. ANBU\n\n\nRank benefits are specialized abilities acquired when one ranks up. Each rank will have several for you to choose from; you automatically acquire any two of your choice, for free. These represent the fact that while all shinobi of a given rank will have similar overall capabilities, there's room for different ninja to have widely varying areas of expertise.\n\nSome benefits can only be taken by members of certain villages, as indicated by a label of &quot;(village) Only&quot;.\n\n====================\n1. Chuunin\n------------------------------\n\nChoose two of the following bonuses when you become Chuunin.\n\n &lt; Leader &gt;<Br>\nYou're exceptionally good at properly using and allocating your human resources. When you are the designated leader of a group, you may activate this benefit up to XP/250 times per in-character week.<Br>\n\nWhen you do so, you can give an order to one person (or use multiple activations to give orders to multiple people). They have a +3 bonus to any relevant rolls to following that order. If the order was to perform a specific action, if applicable it will have +3 Accuracy.<Br>\n\nThese orders must be specific. &quot;Do what you think is best&quot; would not qualify. If you told someone to &quot;hold this position&quot;, that would not give them the bonus to all combat rolls. &quot;Attack that person&quot; wouldn't qualify, but &quot;restrain them somehow&quot; would.<Br>\n\nGenerally speaking, a single instance of this benefit will benefit only a single roll or attack.<Br>\n<Br>\n\n&lt; Nindo &gt;<Br>\nYou have a nindo, or ninja way, that you hold as more important than anything else. It gives you strength and guidance when you find yourself in need of either. This can be something like never leaving a comrade behind (even if they promise they can, and probably can, handle themselves) or never allowing yourself to have an unfair advantage (if a stronger opponent is missing their left arm, holding yours behind your back for the entire fight). The GMs must approve your Nindo. <Br>\n\nOnce per two months (eight real-life days), while actively following our nindo (such as fighting alongside that ally, or in the battle with that enemy), you can activate this benefit. Doing so resets your Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina penalties to 0, and lowers your Fatigue by two categories.<Br>\n\nHowever, if you ever act against your Nindo (even if it's the best decision to make, or just following orders) you cannot use its effects for three months (twelve real-life days).<Br>\n<Br>\n\n&lt; Unrelenting &gt;<Br>\nYou profoundly don't like to give up; when you set your mind to doing something, you do it as it has never been done before. You can spend multiple points of Willpower (or activations of Limit Break, or things that work similarly) on a single roll. There is no limit to how many times you may do so for one action, beyond how many Willpower you have to spend.<Br>\n<Br>\n\n&lt; Will of Fire &gt;  -  Leaf Only<Br>\nWhat brings Leaf ninja together and in some ways makes them the strongest of all the ninja villages--though none would admit this--is their comraderie. That they are more or less a giant family and protect one another as such is why the Leaf ninja prospere, because they do so with a passion.<Br>\n\nWhenever another Leaf ninja is Severely or Critically Wounded, or brought to 0 HP, something sparks within you, motivating you in the defense of one another and the village. Starting immediately, and lasting for (maximum Willpower)*5 IC after your next non-Interrupt action, you do not accumulate penalties to Fatigue, and status effects which you are currently afflicted with are ignored. Any Genjutsu which is affecting you is purged altogether, and you have a +5 bonus to defensive Genjutsu rolls in this time. Multiple instances of Will of Fire overlap, but do not stack.\n<Br>\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://img00.deviantart.net/28a2/i/2009/063/8/5/will_of_fire_by_shadow4457623.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\\page\n\n\n&lt; Mist Born &gt; - Mist Only<Br>\nTraining to fight in low-light environments is something that every village's ninja academy and instructors covers at least briefly. Mist puts more of an emphasis on that than others, some say because of the thick, choking fogs that often engulf their island home, others arguing it's a result of the networks of caverns under the island that students and genin often train under.<Br>\n\nMany Mist shinobi train themselves to be particularly adept at fighting with reduced, or even no, visibility. They adapt to low-light conditions quickly, their eyes adjusting or other senses taking over as necessary. Every 10 IC you spend suffering from a visibility penalty of any severity, the maximum visibility penalty you can suffer from is lowered by 1, applied after Blind Fighting, to a minimum of -2. For example, if you were inside the range of a Hidden Mist Technique for 20 IC, and had 3 ranks of Blind Fighting, the maximum visibility penalty (from any source) you could suffer from would be (10-3-2) = 5.<Br>\n\nHowever, every 10 IC you spend not suffering from any visibility penalties, this bonus decays by 1. In the above example, after 20 IC your Mist Born bonuses would have dissipates entirely.<Br>\n\nIf you have closed your eyes, blindfolded yourself or something similar, Mist Born does not take effect. Wounds and jutsu which temporarily blind you, however, still trigger it. For area-of-effect visibility penalties, you must actually be in the area.<Br>\n\n<Br>\n&lt; Desert Adaptation &gt; - Sand Only<Br>\nThe desert is not a welcoming or forgiving climate. Those who call it home do not consider it an enemy, but also harbor no illusions about just how quickly their homeland will end their lives if they let it. They learn to overcome adversity, because in the desert, there is no other way.<Br>\n\nAs a Speed 0 action you can activate or deactivate this village benefit. While active, you halve all penalties from Fatigue and status effects. Thus, Immobilization 8 would give you only -4 accuracy and defenses and -40% movement speed; Visibility 6, however, would still allow people to hide from you. This specifically does not apply to any damage-dealing effects, such as Bleed, Ignite, and Poison.<Br>\n\nYou may maintain this effect for a total of 50 IC during a battle.<Br>\n```\n```\n\n<img \n  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bleachfanfiction/images/9/9a/Mist_technique.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140425040905' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n2. Jounin\n------------------------------\n\n&lt; Experienced Shinobi &gt;<Br>\nYou've been doing this ninja thing for a while, and it's second nature to you by now. If you could, based on only your DEX and Uniques, reduce the Seal Speed of a ninjutsu you know to 0 (not counting limited-use effects, such Single-Handed Seals' &quot;CHA/10 times per battle&quot; reduction), then you can perform that jutsu without needing to use handseals.<Br>\n\nThis doesn't apply to Genjutsu, Sealing Ninjutsu, or Medical Ninjutsu.\n<Br><Br>\n\n&lt; Mentor &gt;<Br>\nIt's sort of expected that jounin will help teach the next generation of shinobi; indeed, that's why many are given teams of genin to watch over and train. Anyone can explain a concept, but you can actually do so well. You'd make a great instructor, truth be told.<Br>\n\nYou can train other shinobi. This can be done with jutsu, in which case it takes one week per rank of the technique, during which time you and the student can still go on missions and about your regular business, but must be able to spend a reasonable amount of time practicing. This allows a person to learn techniques of one rank beyond their normal imitation, and can only be done with jutsu that you know yourself.<Br>\n\nFor example, if you knew a B-rank Katon jutsu, you could teach it to a Chuunin if they spent at least four weeks around you, learning it.<Br>\n\nYou may also teach any talents under the &quot;Capabilities&quot; heading which you already know. Doing this requires ten weeks of training with your student.  After training is complete, they learn it normally.  However, their next talent must be spent to pay for whatever it was they learned, and they may only be one talent in &quot;debt&quot; at a time. For example, say you were mentoring a student with 1100 XP, who used their first talent to acquire Seal Training. After ten weeks they would be able to learn, for example, Medical Training. At 2500 XP the talent point they'd normally get would be used to &quot;pay for&quot; the Medical Training they received early.<Br>\n\nKeep the GMs informed of who you're training, and with what. There are Infamy gains associated, for both teacher and student. And, notably, teaching members of other villages is looked upon very poorly by your own village and, if they find out, can be tantamount to treason.<Br><Br>\n\n\n&lt; Staying Power &gt;<Br>\nAll this ninja-ing has given you exceptional resilience. You work yourself to the bone and fight against impossible odds on a regular basis; it's not even really all that memorable when you do it, any more! Your bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls from Fatigue is raised by +2 per category (from a default of +5, giving you, under normal circumstances, +7 per Fatigue level).\n\n\n&lt; Back to the Basics &gt;<Br>\nPick one Chuunin rank benefit you don't have. You acquire it.<Br>\n\n\n====================\n3. Special Jounin\n------------------------------\n\n&lt; Skill Mastery &gt;<Br>\nChoose a single skill which relates to your role as a Special Jounin; Medicine for a medic nin, Survival for a tracker, Chakra Control for a seal specialist, and so forth. You must already have the Specialization ability for that skill. When you roll below a 10 when using that skill, your d20 roll is instead considered to be a 10. Your maximum skill ranks are also increased by 3.<Br>\n\nYou must have GM approval for which skill you take this for. You may take Mastery more than once, each time applied to a different skill.<Br><Br>\n\n\n&lt; Highly Talented &gt;<Br>\nWhenever you spend a point of Willpower to reroll a skill roll, you also add 5 points to the final result of the roll. You have one point of &quot;temporary&quot; Willpower, which does not count as one of your maximum WP but is recovered normally, which may only be spent to reroll skill rolls.<Br><Br>\n\n\n&lt; Absurdly Prepared &gt;<Br>\nYou take the concept of being prepared to its logical conclusion, and then keep going. You don't just have the right tools for any given situation, you have more tools than you know what to do with.<Br>\n\nWhenever you spend requisition to obtain an item other than Exploding Tags, you get twice as many of that item. Spending 100 requisition on lockpicks would get you two sets of +1 lockpicks. Buying 10 shuriken would instead give you 20 shuriken, and so forth.<Br><Br>\n\n\n&lt; General Expertise &gt;<Br>\nPick a Chuunin or Jounin rank benefit; you receive it. This does not allow you to choose village-exclusive benefits from other villages.<Br>\n\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n4. ANBU\n------------------------------\n\n&lt; Assassin &gt;<Br>\nWhen you attack an opponent who is completely unaware of your presence (you are in Stealth and they do not know you are hiding from them; thus, this cannot be used if you hide from them mid-battle) your attack has +4 Accuracy and +25% damage.<Br>\n\nAdditionally, you can prepare sneak attacks at twice the regular speed. Thus, when aborting a Prepare Sneak Attack action to perform a Sneak Attack, the duration of your Perform Sneak Attack action only needs to be at least half the Speed of the action you're using as a Sneak Attack.<Br><Br>\n\n\n&lt; Deadly Reflexes &gt;<Br>\nIt's impossible to catch you off guard. You react without even needing time to think about what you're doing, letting yourself process the situation and get your bearings mid-battle. No matter what your Initiative roll at the start of battle, your first action is always on IC 0.<Br><Br>\n\n\n&lt; Critical Strike &gt;<Br>\nYou know the value of a single, decisive blow at the right moment. It ends battles--and lives. When attacking, if partial defense applies to your attack's damage you may spend 1 point of Willpower and cause all effects of partial defense to be ignored for that attack.<Br>\n\nThis is declared before you roll damage, and does allow your opponent to, in response, spend a Willpower point of their own on their defense. If this causes them to avoid your attack after all, your point of Willpower is not spent.<Br>\n\nThis may only be used successfully once per battle. Remember, you can only spend 1 point of Willpower on a single action; thus, if you had already used a point of Willpower to roll your Accuracy, you couldn't spend a second one for Critical Strike.<Br><Br>\n\n\n&lt; Hunter Nin &gt;  -  Mist Only<Br>\nYou may designate a single person as your quarry. Doing so requires a week to study any available information on them and to, through a mixture of not getting enough sleep and mild meditation, get yourself in the proper mindset.<Br>\n\nYou have +6 to Survival rolls to track your quarry, and +5 to Awareness and Espionage rolls made against them. Your Accuracy for attacks made against them is increased by 3, and your damage by 25% for the purpose of determining wounds. When fighting them, you have 1 point of temporary Willpower, and gain another point of temporary Willpower every 50 IC.\n<Br>\nIt takes four weeks of mentally detaching yourself from the hunt to end the quarry status of a person, be it because you've killed them or given up the hunt. You may only designate one person as your quarry at a time.<Br><Br>\n\n\n&lt; Extensive Training &gt;<Br>\nPick a Chuunin or Jounin rank benefit; you receive it.\n```\n```\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3133/149627-68014-anbu.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\nANBU doing what they have done best in Naruto World's past, watching shit happen, or totally worfing it.\n\n\\page\n# Infamy\n>1. Explanation\n2. Gaining Infamy\n   a. Missions\n   b. Rank\n   c. Experience\n   d. Killing\n   e. Other\n3. Effects of Infamy\n\n====================\n1. Explanation\n------------------------------\n<Br>\nThe nature of the job is that ninja are seldom well-liked by any village other than their own. Working together with foreign nin is certainly not unheard of, and respect goes a long way in the shinobi world, but trusting someone with your life does not mean you should actually trust them.<Br><Br>\n\nAlso part of the nature of the job is that anyone who distinguishes themselves begins to get some sort of reputation; you can be either obscure, or successful, and despite how stealthy ninja try to be, being both has throughout history proven to be an impossibility.\n<Br>\nThat is what Infamy is: how well and widely known you are, the strength of your reputation. Infamy is a curse and a blessing, and more the former than the latter. It can, sometimes, be useful, especially if you have a reputation for being honorable and need to convince suspicious adversaries that you're trustworthy.\n<Br>\nMost of the time, however, it's an albatross around your neck. The more famous you are, the more every other village wants you dead, because then you'll be one less advantage possessed by one of their potential enemies.\n<Br>\nTo be clear, Infamy is fairly abstract. If you go on an E-rank mission, chances are no foreign ninja are going to see you doing it--but you still gain Infamy for it. If you kill someone and nobody finds out about it, you still gain Infamy for it. These Infamy gains are meant to be representative of your character's overall renown, not the actual effect of one specific action.\n```\n```\n\n\n\n====================\n2. Gaining Infamy\n------------------------------\n\n - a.  Missions\nCompleting missions awards infamy; the more active you are, and the higher-profile the tasks you're completing, the more likely it is that somebody's going to hear about you, or that you'll develop a reputation.\n<Br>\nCompleting a mission awards 1 point of Infamy per rank; 1 for an E-rank, 2 for a D-rank, and so forth, up to 6 points of Infamy for an S-ranked mission.\n<Br>\nAlthough characters are assumed to be frequently going on missions appropriate to their skill level off-screen, this only applies for actual missions run by GMs. This is awarded regardless of success or failure.\n\n\n - b. Rank\nFor every rank other than genin you obtain, you get +5 Infamy. If you're somehow demoted, you do not lose that Infamy, and you do not get it a second time if you're repromoted.\n<Br>\nThus, someone who was promoted to chuunin then promoted to jounin would have +10 Infamy (total) from rank. Later, they're selected for ANBU, and after a few years of that retire to special jounin status; they're no longer a jounin or ANBU, but still have a total of +20 Infamy from ranks.\n<Br>\nThe exception is Missing Nin. If you desert your village, you acquire +15 Infamy. If you manage to be accepted back into your old village or join a new one (good luck with that), and then go missing again (...seriously?) your Infamy once again increases by 15; for a total of, in that example, +30 from having gone missing twice.\n\n\n - c. Experience\nThe more talented you are, the more likely you are to stand out and be remembered. Accordingly, for every 500 XP you have, you get a cumulative +1 Infamy. At 1000 XP you'd get +2, at 1500 it'd be +3, for a total of (+1 +2 +3 = ) +6.\n\n\n - d.  Killing\nIf you kill a player character with at least half your Infamy, you gain 20% of their Infamy.\n\n - e.  Other\nGMs may award Infamy at their discretion for reasons that don't fall into any of the above categories.\n\nOne notable thing that can result in Infamy: Certain jutsu, abilities, and special techniques not necessarily listed in the PHB may require &quot;Training&quot;--they're rarely, often closely-guarded secrets. Knowing one of these is like adding another ring to that bull's-eye on the back of your head: it's one more reason for you to be an advantage your village has that everyone else would just love to neutralize.\n<Br>\nSet values for that do exist, but they are S-E-C-R-E-T. Notably, if you obtain those kinds of things through the use of Talents you don't suffer that increase in Infamy.\n\n\\page\n\n\n====================\n3. Effects of Infamy\n------------------------------\n\nThe biggest effect of Infamy is that it contributes to your bounty, should you ever wind up in the bingo books of one or more villages... and chances are you will wind up there, eventually. Even if you don't do anything particularly unforgivable, with high enough Infamy they'll probably just add you as a matter of principle--though, by that point, just to get your Infamy that high you've probably irritated them a few times too many anyway. Bounties are, by default, Infamy*10 Ryo, once you actually have one.\n\nOnce you reach 25 Infamy, it's possible that anyone who encounters you (and learns your name) has heard of you; a result of (35 - your Infamy /10) or better on a Research roll means they know basic information like your village, rank, and bounty, and possibly a general idea of your reputation.\n\nInfamy can also attract other sorts of... unwanted attention.</text>\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://i.pinimg.com/736x/63/2c/5c/632c5c803a9ddaa0ba8dd1892a928e1b--naruto-uzumaki-orochimaru.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\\page\n\n\n># Logs\n1. Explanation\n2. Spent XP\n3. Infamy\n4. XP Logs\n   a. Battles\n   b. RP Log\n   c. Events\n   d. Training\n   e. Other\n5. Total XP\n\n\n====================\n1. Explanation\n------------------------------\n\nLogging certain things in this game is mandatory. It's unfortunate, and undesirable, but it's also necessary for everyone's sake.\n\nPartly, this is for your own benefit. It helps you keep track of things your character has gained, and makes it easy for you to go back and check your work.\n\nAlso, as an unfortunate truth, some people will, when they can't be held accountable, cheat. It has happened before, frequently enough to necessitate the use of these logs. This isn't saying that we distrust any one person in particular--but rather, that the only fair way to handle this is to hold everyone to the same standard.\n\nThe only mandatory part of the regular character sheet is everything under the &quot;Logs&quot; tab. Below are instructions on how to properly fill them out.\n\n\n====================\n2. Spent XP\n------------------------------\n\nThis log tallies how you've allocated the XP you've earned. It's divided into two columns: Categories, and each category's responded &quot;Allocation&quot;--which is how much you've spent in that category.\n\nSo, if you'd spent 200 XP raising your attributes, you'd write &quot;200&quot; in the Allocation column, across from Attribute\n\n - a.  Ability\nThe total XP you've spent on all your abilities, both standard and clan. It should be autocalc the total on your sheet.\n\n - b.  Jutsu\nThe total XP you've spent learning all your jutsu. This may be modified by some uniques; use the actual, modified total here.It should be autocalc the total on your sheet.\n\n - c.  Attribute\nThe total amount of XP you've spent raising your attributesIt should be autocalc the total on your sheet.\n\n - d.  Other\nAnything else which you've had to spend XP on. Your sheet doesn't automatically keep track of this, but you should!\n\n - e. XP Total\nThe total of how much XP you've earned. You'll calculate this in the &quot;Total XP&quot; log; just copy the number from there over to here.\nIf you have an XP Bonus, you should make a note of that instead, though keep in mind that your actual total is important for calculating some limits. If you had 200 XP, and a 10% bonus, a good way to fill this out might be &quot;220 (200+20)&quot;. That way, you know how much XP you have to spend (220), and also your normal Total XP (200), to use when determining things like the max amount you can spend on attributes.\n\n - f. XP Spent\nHow much XP you've spent on everything put together. This is the total of your Ability, Jutsu, Attribute, and Other values in this category.\n\n - g.  XP Remaining\nThis is how much XP you haven't spent on anything--you can hold onto it as long as you wish, or spend it as you please. Subtract XP Spent from XP Total; the result is what you'll put here.\n\n\n====================\n3. Infamy\n------------------------------\n\nHow you can keep track of your infamy!\n\n - a.  Infamy\nEach entry should be fairly self-explanatory once you've read the Infamy node in the PHB. In &quot;Missions&quot;, use the total from the Missions grid to the right. &quot;Rank&quot;, &quot;Experience&quot;, and &quot;Kills&quot; are all explained in the Infamy node. &quot;Other&quot; is anything which doesn't fall in those categories, such as GM-awarded Infamy. And finally, &quot;Total&quot; is the sum of all those boxes.\n\n\n - b.  Missions\nA short list of official missions you've completed for your village. # Completed is exactly what it sounds like; how many missions of that rank you've done. &quot;Infamy&quot; will be the number of missions in that category multiplied by the Infamy-per-mission for that rank.\n\nTotal has a box for your total number of missions completed, and the total amount of Infamy earned from missions.\n\n\n - c.  Notes\nWhat goes here is included in the node! But, in short, it's an explanation for who you killed, and when, to get Infamy (and how much it was), and a list of any &quot;Other&quot; Infamy acquisitions. The GMs who awarded those, regrettably, don't have perfect memories.\n\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n# 4. XP Logs\n - a. Name\nIf a spar, list the people involved, if a mission, get the name from a ST. If a RP, same as spar, list who was involved.\n - b. Type of Action\nRP, Spar, Mission, or Other.\n - c. IC Location\nThe Village or outside the village the country unless ST specifies.\n - e. Room Location\nThe room on discord this took place in.\n - f. Times\nThe start/end times, please list your local time (CST,EST,etc)\n \n\n\n====================\n5. Total XP\n------------------------------\n\nAnd so we come to the end! Here you'll find a column of categories, and, opposite them, a column in which to enter numbers!\n\nFor Battle, RP, Event, and Other, take the most recent &quot;Total XP&quot; entry from the respective categories in XP Logs, and copy them over.\n\nSimilarly, Training is just the &quot;Total&quot; number in your Training Log.\n\nCreation should pretty much always be 100.\n\n\nXP Bonus is only important if you have one. Unless you are a Clanless, a Juugo Suto, or a person with the Super Novice unique, you probably don't have an XP Bonus.\n\nYou should rename &quot;XP Bonus (__%)&quot; to the actual percent you have; for example, &quot;XP Bonus (10%)&quot;. In the accompanying box, multiply your Total by that percent. 10% of 131, for example, is 13.\n\nTotal + Bonus is your Total XP, plus your XP Bonus.\n\\page\n\n\n># Talents\n1. Introduction\n2. Acquiring Talents\n3. Types of Talents\n\n====================\n1. Introduction\n------------------------------\n\nTalents are things which differentiate your character from the rank-and-file ninja. Jutsu, skills, and abilities are all things which are fairly common. True, most ninja won't know A-ranked Suiton jutsu--but knowing them is less a sign that one is &quot;special&quot;, and more an indication that you're an advanced ninja.\n\nTalents are somewhere between uniques and abilities. They're not fundamental aspects of your character--they're things you've learned or developed over time, that are genuinely hard to come by in an average shinobi.\n\nIn a more meta sense, talents are a way of getting rare, exclusive abilities for your character. And the best part, they're totally free!\n\n====================\n2. Acquiring Talents\n------------------------------\n\nYou get talents automatically as your character gains experience. You get talents at the following XP milestones:\n1000 <BR>\n2500 <BR>\n4500 <BR>\n6000<BR>\nAnd every 1500 XP afterwards (7500, 9000, etc.) <BR>\n\nThus, a 3000 XP character would have two talents!\n\nYou don't have to choose talents as soon as they're accessible. If you get to 1000 XP and aren't sure what you want, it's perfectly alright to hold off until later. There are no penalties for waiting until later to pick talents.\n\nYou can take &quot;Enhancement&quot; talents repeatedly, whereas most &quot;Capability&quot; talents can only be taken once.\n\n====================\n3. Types of Talents\n------------------------------\n\nTalents are divided into two broad categories: Enhancements and Capabilities.\n\nEnhancements are ways in which your character is just plain better than the rank-and-file ninja. They're things you're able to do that can't be taught or learned, fundamental parts of you. These are all passive benefits.\n\nCapabilities are a bit different. They're things you've learned how to do, rare or esoteric techniques that anyone could, in theory, learn, if they had the opportunity and dedication.\n\nMost of the talents \n\nlisted in &quot;Capabilities&quot; can be acquired through other means--for example, some skilled shinobi might be willing to mentor an up-and-coming student in how to perform medical jutsu, or you could make a deal with a missing nin to help them abduct victims for unethical experiments in exchange for them teaching you how to use fuuinjutsu (*coughryuucough*).\n\nThat said, those things are usually very difficult to acquire, and may come with strings attached (which may not always be visible).\n\nLearning these things through talents carry no such requirements or downsides. You can have any RP justification you want (within reason), such as being the student of a renowned medic nin in your village, but there are no requirements beyond purchasing the talents.</text>\n\n>1.

Enhancements\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Celerity\nAll your actions have their Speed reduced by 2. This functions exactly the same as spending AP to reduce their Speed, and follows all the normal rules for doing so; it can also be combined with AP to lower an action's Speed further.\n\nHowever, because Celerity takes place automatically, it still applies in situations where you're normally prohibited from spending AP (such as Surprise Attacks). You may choose not to apply this talent, or only partially apply it, to a given action if you wish.\n\n\n#### b.  Generalist\nYou've got an astonishing array of skills, even for a ninja. You gain any two rank benefits you currently or previously qualified for.\n\n\n#### c.  Multiple Summoning Contracts\nOrdinarily, a shinobi can only sign a single summoning contract (at least, the ones listed in the PHB--special summoning contracts don't typically count for this). With this talent, you can have multiple! Not sure how you convinced the various summon animals to be okay with this, but congratulations.\n\n\n#### d.  Prodigy\nYou acquire a single rank benefit. This can be from a rank you've never had, and even one exclusive to another village (such as taking Hunter Nin when you're a Leaf Chuunin).\n\n\n#### e.  Skill Specialist\nYou have an additional XP/200 Skill Points. You may only take Skill Specialist once.\n\nTaking this multiple times allows you to apply it to a different skill each time, or repeatedly to the same skill. If applied to the same skill, each additional application of Skill Specialist gives another daily reroll.\n\n====================\n2. Capabilities\n------------------------------\n\n#### a.  Eight Gates\nIn the human body, there are eight 'gates' along the body's chakra circulatory system responsible for regulating the flow of chakra, and by extension providing physical limiters to the body for its own protection.\n\nYou may take this talent up to three times. Each time you take it, you gain access to two of the gates. The first time you take this talent, you gain the ability to open the 1st and 2nd gates; the second time gives you access to the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th gates; and, finally, taking the Eight Gates talent a third time changes the wounding equation in gates to 3*(gate opened) + (base Speed of the action) + (AP used) %\n\nSee &quot;The Eight Gates&quot; for more information about how these work.\n```\n```\n\n\n\n#### b.  Kage Bunshin\nYou learn martial ar--Kage Bunshin no Jutsu! It's a not-quite-forbidden technique, and probably the most powerful of the cloning techniques usable by ninja without advanced bloodlines. Unfortunately, it's also very draining on the user, almost prohibitively so.\n\nSee &quot;Kage Bunshin&quot; for the rules for this technique.\n\n\n#### c.  Summoning Contract\nYou've signed a blood contract with one of the various species of intelligent, super-powered animals that ninja are able to call upon. How this happens varies; some shinobi have mentors who, as part of training an apprentice to be their successor, will offer them the chance to sign one of these contracts.\n\nWith this talent, however, you probably took the 'natural' approach: a ninja who hasn't signed a contract and attempts to performing the Summoning Technique will instead be &quot;reverse-summoned&quot; to the home of whichever animal species they have the strongest affinity for (which can change over a ninja's life). There, they will usually be given an opportunity to sign a blood contract before being sent back to where they came from.\n\nPick a single summoning contract--you now have access to it, as describe in &quot;Summoning.&quot; To actually summon any of the creatures, or use any of the techniques, provided by this talent you first need the C-rank ninjutsu &quot;Kuchiyose no Jutsu.&quot; If you have this talent, you may purchase that technique without meeting the normal requirements for learning C-rank jutsu.\n\n\\page\n\n\n#### d.  Medical Training\nMedical jutsu are particularly difficult to learn compared to normal techniques, due to the extreme amounts of precision, and knowledge of the human body, they require.\n\nYou got someone to teach you the principles of medical ninjutsu, or were one of the rare few who managed to figure them out yourselves after months of exhausting study. This talent allows you to learn Medical Ninjutsu of D- and C-rank.\n\n\n#### e.  Natural Chakra\nIn addition to the chakra within shinobi--and indeed, in every living being--there is chakra permeating the entire world. Normally, this matters no more to shinobi than the oxygen in the air they breathe. It's possible to learn how to access this natural chakra, which is what you've done with this talent.\n\nNatural chakra use is broken down into three tiers: Enlightened, Adept, and Sage. Each time you take this talent you gain access to one of the tiers, in order; accordingly, you can take it up to three times.\n\n\n#### f. Rare Poisons\nYou have access to two of the rarest, deadliest poisons in the world: that of the golden dart frog, and the blue-ringed octopus. As the villages tend to have very small supplies of these venoms on hand (if they even have any at all), this usually involves shady contacts or harvesting the toxins yourself.\n\nYou cannot take this talent before you have 35 ranks of the Toxicology skill. With it, you are able to purchase doses of Golden Dart Frog or Blue Ringed Octopus poisons (found in Chapter 8) using Requisiton or Savings.\n\nEach dose costs 1000 Ryo; unlike normal poisons, the price does not go down for buying them in bulk. You can have a maximum of two doses (of the same poison, or one of each) purchased with Requisition at a time. After using one, you must two OOC weeks before replacing it.\n\n\n\n#### g.  Seal Training\nSeals as in sealing techniques (fuuinjutsu), not handseals! These are advanced, highly specialized techniques; they're not necessary to be a ninja, by any means, but they can be useful.\n\nYou understand enough about the principles above fuuinjutsu to use some of the more advanced techniques. Most of the time, this is because you got someone (a sensei, or a jounin who you did enough favors for) to teach you, but some particularly eruditious students are able to piece together what they need to do on their own.\n\nThis allows you to learn C- and B-rank Sealing ninjutsu.</text>\n```\n```\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/c/c0/Chikatsu_Saisei.png/revision/latest?cb=20130321164005' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\\page\n\n># The Eight Gates\n1. Introduction\n2. Rules\n3. Wounding\n4. How to Read\n5. Restrictions\n\n====================\n1. Introduction\n------------------------------\n\nInside the human body there are eight gates which regulate the flow of energy through the person's chakra circulatory system. They have the function of self-imposed biological limiters, preventing a person from catastrophically overexerting themselves.\n\nNinja, however, are nothing if not cheerily self-destructive. Inevitably, shinobi found the way to forcibly, temporarily &quot;open&quot; these gates. The result is a surge of chakra flow through the body, and an accompanying spike in physical performance.\n\nThe downside is that accessing the gates pushes the human body well beyond its tolerance. While being able to access the gates for a brief surge of power does provide a substantial tactical advantage, doing so for even a short time can seriously injure the user.\n\nAs mentioned, there are eight gates, but learning how to open each one is an endeavor unto itself; knowing how to open the first and second gates doesn't mean you understand the third.\n\n<img \n  src='https://dailyanimeart.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/might-gai-guy-gate-of-death-eight-by-deohvi1.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \n====================\n2. Rules\n------------------------------\n\nEach gate confers its own set of benefits and abilities which you receive and can use while it's open, described under the individual gate's effects.\n\nWhen the gates are opened, you have access to a special, second pool of Action Points, starting at 0 and with a maximum of half your normal AP maximum (in other words, AGI/4).\n\nAP provided by the gates (listed under &quot;AP Gain&quot; in their respective entries) goes into this pool. AP from the gates may only be spent on the following things:\n&gt; Reducing the Speed of taijutsu attacks\n&gt; Abilities provided by the gates\n&gt; The ability Principle of Motion\n&gt; The ability Surge (though if improving Accuracy, only for unarmed attacks)\n\nYour regular AP may still be spent normally, as well as on abilities provided by the gates.\n\nOnce you're able to access the gates, you gain the following two actions:\n\n\nOpen Gates (Speed 5 + 3 * X, Stamina 15 + 5 * X)\nYou open one or more of the eight gates. By default, this opens only a single gate; you may choose to open several at once, for a total of 1 + X gates. Doing this, however, drastically increases the strain put upon your body, causing you to immediately suffer X wounds (as described in Wounding, below).\n\nFor example, if you had two gates open, and wanted to open three more, it would be a Speed (5 + 3*2) 11 action, with a Stamina cost of (15 + 5*2) 25, and you'd suffer 2 random wounds.\n\n\nClose Gates (Speed 5 + 5 * X)\nYou take several moments to calm yourself and stabilize your chakra flow before willing your chakra gates shut. This shuts all open gates, with X being the number currently opened. Unlike opening, closing them is all-or-nothing.\n\n====================\n3. Wounding\n------------------------------\n\nAs mentioned above, using the gates is devastating, in no small part because doing so gives the user's body the ability to physically tear itself apart.\n\nEvery time you take an action with a Stamina or Chakra cost while using the gates, you have a chance to wound yourself. That chance is:\n\n5*(gate opened) + (base Speed of the action) + (AP used) %\n\nFor example, say you had opened the second gate and used a basic unarmed attack (Speed 8), and spent 4 AP to reduce it down to Speed 4. After performing your action you'd roll 1d100, and on a roll of (5*2 + 8 + 4) = 24 or lower, you'd immediately suffer a wound.\n\nThese wounds cannot be prevented or reduced in severity. The gates inflict Blunt wounds. When you suffer one, roll for location.\n\nThe first wound you suffer on a given location in a single week (OOC day) from the gates is a Minor wound. The second is a Major, the third a Severe, and the fourth a Critical.\n\nFor example, if you wounded yourself using the gates six times, and rolled head three times, left arm once, right arm once, and chest once, you'd have:\nA minor, major, and severe head wound\nTwo minor arm wounds\nAnd a minor chest wound\n\nFor a total of six different wounds.\n\nAdditionally, any wound-healing abilities (such as some Medical ninjutsu, or Henzaki Organ Mobility) cannot be used while the gates are still open: you have to close them first.\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n4. How to Read\n------------------------------\n\nEach gate contains a brief description of what it does, an &quot;AP Gain&quot; number, and an ability.\n\nEvery time the IC reaches a multiple of 10, you gain the action points listed under AP Gain, added to your gates-specific pool of AP. If that pool is full, any excess AP are simply list.\n\nYou only receive the AP Gain of the highest gate you have open.\n\nEach gate also has a listed ability, such as the first gate's Enhanced Strength and the second gate's Rejuvenation. You have access to the abilities of all opened gates. For example, with the third gate open you would be able to use Enhanced Strength (first), Rejuvenation (second), and Enhanced Power (third).\n\n\n====================\n5. Restrictions\n------------------------------\n\nThe eight gates work poorly with weapons, much to the woe of many shinobi.  This has a great deal to do with their nature: while they grant overwhelming power, the user's technique tends to suffer as a result. Weapons simply aren't meant to be used by a body tearing itself apart, or swung with that sort of speed and force.\n\nAccordingly, some of the abilities granted by the gates do not work with weapons as well as they do with unarmed attacks. Specifically...\n\n<br> Enhanced Strength: Cannot be used with weapons.\n<br> Enhanced Power: Cannot be used with weapons.\n<br> Enhanced Speed: Does not increase weapon Accuracy.\n<br> Extreme Speed: May not be used to raise weapon Accuracy.\n<BR>\n\nAdditionally, members of the Hozuki clan cannot open the gates when using their Hydration Technique--their body has no bones, muscles, or circulatory system to enhance.\n\nActivating the technique will not close any open gates, but will suspend all their effects (including AP generation, ability to spend Gates AP, and the chance to wound oneself when acting) until the Hydration Technique is ended.</text>\n\n\\page \n\n# The Gates\n##   -= The First Gate =-\n###  -= Kaimon - Gate of Opening =-\n\nLocated in the brain, opening this gate removes the body's ability to limit the output of its muscles.\n\nAP Gain: 5\n\n   Enhanced Strength\nYou can spend AP to increase your Physical Damage Bonus for a single attack, at the rate of 1 AP per 0.4. You may spend up to STR/10 AP this way.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n##   -= The Second Gate =-\n###   -= Kyuumon - Gate of Healing =-\n\nAlso located in the brain, the second regulates the body's breakdown of stored energy. By opening it, the body gains the ability to access its energy reserves faster than would normally be physically possible.\n\nAP Gain: 10\n\n   Rejuvenation\nYou may spend AP at any time to reduce your Stamina penalty. Every 2 AP spent reduces your Stamina penalty by 1.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n##   -= The Third Gate =-\n###   -= Seimon - Gate of Life =-\n\nLocated on the spinal cord between the shoulders, opening the third gate results in one's blood vessels dilating, causing increased blood flow throughout the body.\n\nOpening this gate also has the effect of turning the user's skin a very marked reddish color.\n\nAP Gain: 15\n\n   Accelerated Bloodflow\nThe increased flow of blood to all regions of your body keeps your cells oxygenated and able to perform at their peak. You reduce your Fatigue penalties by the number of gates you have open. Therefore, if you were at Fatigue 4 with the third gate open, you would have only a -1 penalty to Accuracy and a -5 penalty to defenses.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n##   -= The Fourth Gate =-\n###  -= Shoumon - Gate of Pain =-\n\nLocated below the Gate of Life, the fourth gate got its name for a very simple reason: beyond what's normal even for the other gates, opening causes severe pain across the entire body as the overwhelming flow of chakra begins physically tearing the user's muscle fibers.\n\n\nAP Gain: 20\n\n\n   Enhanced Power\nFor every AP you spend reducing an attack's Speed, you may spend another AP to &quot;buy back&quot; the lowered damage bonus.\n\nFor example, say you spent 4 AP to bring a basic unarmed attack from Speed 8 to Speed 4. Normally you would deal (damage bonus)*(4) damage with this attack, because its Speed is 4. However, with Enhanced Power you could spend up to 4 AP increasing its effective Speed.\n\nThus, if you spent 3 AP on Enhanced Power, you'd deal (damage bonus)*(7) damage.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n##   -= The Fifth Gate =-\n###   -= Tomon - Gate of Limit =-\n\nLocated in the middle of the torso, the fifth gate is below the fourth on the spinal column (which also serves as the body's primary chakra meridian). Opening results in a marked increase in speed and power for the shinobi who does so, but begins tearing tendons away from the bones they're anchored to.\n\nAP Gain: 25\n\n   Enhanced Speed\nEvery 5 AP you spend on attack increases its Accuracy by 1. Every 5 AP you currently have in your gate-specific AP pool gives you a +1 bonus to dodge rolls.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n##   -= The Sixth Gate =-\n###   -= Keimon - Gate of View =-\n\nPlaced in the lower abdomen, the gate of view is responsible for, relative to the previous five, gross regulation of chakra, with the first five gates fine-tuning its distribution to one extent or another.\n\nSimply opening the sixth gate results in the body blasting chakra out from every one of its tenketsu. While it's open the user will radiate a strong artificial 'wind'; trees will bend away, and water will rise form vortexes around them.\n\nAP Gain: 30\n\n   Extreme Speed\nAfter making an attack or attempting to dodge and seeing if it succeeds or fails, you may spend AP to increase its result by 1 for every 10 points of AP spent.\n\nAdditionally, you may use Enhanced Strength or Enhanced Power after determining if your attack hits.\n\\page\n\nNote: The last two gates can only be obtained by GM approval.\n____________________________________________\n\n##   -= The Seventh Gate =-\n###   -= Kyoumon - Gate of Wonder =-\n\nLocated near the base of the spine, at hip level, the seventh gate results in the most marked physical changes since the third. The user begins using glowing green sweat from their pores; the amounts of chakra rushing through the user's chakra circulatory system are becoming genuinely destructive to the body, and so it tries to vent it out the only way it can... resulting in glowing green, chakra-infused sweat.\n\nAdditionally, merely having this gate open results in shredding one's muscle fibers. While chakra can make up for lost functionality, even a light touch causes severe pain to someone who's opened the seventh gate recently.\n\nAP Gain: 40\n\n   Defiance\nSo long as the Seventh Gate remains open, you ignore the effects of all wounds you're suffering from (though they will still accumulate normally)\n\n____________________________________________\n\n##   -= The Eighth Gate =-\n###   -= Shimon - Gate of Death =-\n\nLocated near the heart, this is the final option for any user of the gates, when accomplishing their goal is more important than their life. With all eight gates opened, there's nothing to regulate the body's chakra flow, and since it's inherently tied to every major organ in the body, there's very little to regulate organ function either.\n\nOpening the eighth gate will cause the user's death, without exception. However, for those few minutes before their heart literally pumps itself to death, before their raging chakra system finishes tearing their organs into pulp, and before they convert vital portions of their body into energy, a user of the eighth gate has unrivaled power.\n\nAP Gain: 50\n\n   Last Stand\nWhen you first open the eighth gate, all wounds you are presently suffering from are removed. So long as the Eighth Gate remains open, your HP cannot be reduced below 1.\n\nHowever, when you fall unconscious or close the Eighth Gate, or when you have a Blunt Critical Wound on every location of your body (both arms, both legs, chest, abdomen, head), you die.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n### --( Kage Bunshin no Jutsu - Shadow Clone Technique )--\nPerhaps the pinnacle of development for the ninja replication technique is this jutsu. Whereas bunshin creates what are essentially illusions, shadow clones use chakra to create a perfect copy of the original person.\n\nDespite this, they are fairly delicate and unstable; a solid blow will harm the clone as if it was flesh and blood, but moments later the bunshin will vanish in a puff of smoke.\n\n  -  Speed: 5, +2 per clone\n  -  Seal Speed: 5, +2 per clone\n\nEffects:\nYou may create any number of clones; however, each clone raises your Fatigue level by 1. You can't regain Fatigue spent on clones so long as they exist. When created, Kage Bunshin have all Wounds and Upkeeps you do, but not status effects. Wounds gained, and Upkeeps activated, after they're created do not automatically transfer to the clones.\n\nKage bunshin can perform any action other than creating more clones; they can even perform handseals and use jutsu. Kage Bunshin are always at Fatigue 1, and if they fail a Fatigue roll or take any damage they're destroyed.\n\nIf a clone is destroyed, you do not get its Fatigue level back. You may, as a Speed 5 + 2 * X action, end 1 + X clones. Clones ended this way vanish in a puff of smoke, and you regain the Fatigue level spent on them.\n\nAlthough you do not have a mental link with your clones, when one ceases to exist (either because it's destroyed or because you voluntarily ended it) you gain memories of all the experiences it had in the time when it was separated from you. These memories, while 'legible', seem slightly unreal, the mental equivalent of looking at a photograph's negatives (meaning you can't confuse them with your own &quot;real&quot; memories).\n\n\nIn combat, as mentioned, kage bunshin can act as if they were you. If they are present at the start of battle, they use your initiative roll; otherwise, they may act the IC after they're created.\n\nMentally commanding your clones to act costs 1 AP per 5 Speed of the action they're going to use.\n\nFor example, say you made a Shadow Clone, and on IC 80 you wanted it to punch an enemy. This is a Speed 8 action, so you'd spend 2 AP, and your clone couldn't act again until IC 88.\n\nIf, on IC 85, somebody attacked your clone, you could spend 1 AP to have it take a Dodge action (Speed 2), after which you wouldn't be able to give it another non-Interrupt order until IC 90.\n\nWhen Kage Bunshin attack, their actions are always considered to be Held Back, as per the ability in Chapter 5; they use half your damage bonus on your attacks, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced one category. This applies even if you do not have the Hold Back ability.\n\nClones do not accumulate AP, and you may not spend AP to reduce the Speed of their actions. They do not have their own Willpower, but you may spend your own Willpower for them.\n\n\nWhen created, Shadow Clones have all your equipment, with the following exceptions:\n1. Consumable items (flash and smoke bombs, poison, exploding tags, and so on).  Anything which, after being used, cannot be reused.\n2. Chakra-infused items (such as storage scrolls) are physically replicated, but have no special properties.\n3. No electronic items (cameras, comm devices) or items with complex moving parts function.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n>## Natural Chakra\n1. Introduction\n2. Learning\n\n====================\n1. Introduction\n------------------------------\n\nChakra is everywhere, an intangible force permeating the world. For the most part, ninja (and everyone else) ignore this. It's like knowing that there's oxygen all around: necessarily for life, but not particularly worthy of attention since it's always there.\n\nIt does play an important roll for shinobi: they naturally respire chakra from the environment, just like they inhale and exhale air, but as chakra is omnipresent, it never matters.\n\nIt's called 'natural chakra'. Very rarely, some ninja manage to learn how to access it. The scarcity of this ability has a lot to do with the fact that in most situations, it's impractical: accessing nature chakra requires one to be able to sit calmly and undisturbed for a significant amount of time, something which ninja rarely have the opportunity to do when under pressure.\n\n====================\n2. Learning\n------------------------------\n\nLearning to access nature chakra is not something one simply does: it takes months of slowly learning to harmonize oneself with the world around them, gradually learning to deliberately calm the flow of chakra within their own body.\n\nSimilarly, someone who can use nature chakra does not progress in stages; it's a natural growth, a process of inner learning.\n\nHowever, that would be horribly difficult to represent with game mechanics, so natural chakra is conveniently broken down into three tiers! They are, in order: Enlightened, Adept, and Sage.\n\nWithin each tier, there are several abilities (which can be logged either under Other, or by creating a new ability breakdown for nature chakra). By each ability there is a listed XP cost, which you must pay to learn it. You can purchase any ability within a tier you have access to, so long as you meet its listed requirements.</text>\n\n### Natural Chakra Abilities\n1. Enlightened\n2. Adept\n3. Sage\n\n====================\n1. Enlightened\n------------------------------\n\n#####   Meditation (10 XP)\nThe most basic ability someone seeking to harness natural chakra must master, this is precisely what it sounds like. You sit down, close your eyes, and become perfectly still, clearing your mind.\n\nObviously, this is easier said than done; a novice will find themselves thinking about not thinking, then their nose will start to itch, they'll get fidgety... and that is where most give up in frustration and go back to studying high-power ninjutsu.\n\nWhen meditating you cannot talk, or even open your eyes to look around, though you do remain aware of your surroundings to the extent of what you can feel and hear. Indeed, much of meditation is learning how to observe one's surroundings impartially, without reacting. You cannot maintain any Upkeeps greater than 0 while meditating.\n\nIn battle, you may declare Meditate as an action. When meditating, you do nothing. Meditate as an action lasts until you declare that you Abort it; you do not need to declare how long you'll be meditating when you begin.\n\nThere are two ways to end meditation. \n\nThe first is with End Meditation, a Speed 5 action which cannot have its Speed reduced.\n\nThe second is your meditation being disrupted. This occurs if you take any action other than End Meditation, if you are hit by any damaging attack, or if you are moved in any way. If this happens, you have a -5 penalty to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina, Accuracy, and all d20 rolls, for the next 10 IC.\n\n\n#####   A Tranquil Body (10 XP)\nAs you meditate your body relaxes and is refreshed, weariness ebbing away and pain fading. Every 10 IC you spend meditating, your Stamina penalty is reduced by 1.\n\n\n#####   A Tranquil Mind (10 XP)\nBy emptying your mind, you reach a state of total serenity. Your emotions fade away, letting you assess things calmly and rationally. With that tranquility comes inner balance, disturbances of the mind translating into disturbance of one's chakra, and their absence doing the same. Every 10 IC you spend meditating, your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is reduced by 1\n\n\n#####   A Tranquil Soul (20 XP)\nWhen your mind and body are in harmony, each completely silent and at ease, your spirit becomes the same. Once you've been meditating for 20 IC, you may sacrifice a point of Willpower to lower your Fatigue level by 1. After doing so, you must wait at least 20 IC before using it again.\n######   Requires: A Tranquil Body, A Tranquil Mind\n<BR>\n\n#####   Path to Tranquility (10 XP)\nIf you spend at least 100 IC meditating, the first time you fail a Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina roll in the next ten minutes you advance one less Fatigue category; your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties still reset to 0.\n######   Requires: A Tranquil Soul\n\n\n\\page\n\n#####    A Dream of the World (20 XP)\nAs one sinks into meditation, they become detached from their worldly senses and the accompanying distractions. Only by doing so can they notice the minute variations in the world's own chakra, in all their subtle wonder.\n\nWhile meditating, you can tell how many people are within X yards, where X is the number of IC you've spent meditating, up to a maximum of your CHA. This does not, however, allow you tell anything else about them, even their direction or distance.\n\nExcept in combat! In combat, this allows you to find hiding enemies. Every 5 IC you spend meditating while a hidden enemy is within your range, you may make a Chakra Control roll against their Stealth TN, with a +2 bonus for every 5 IC (total) you've been meditating.\n   Requires: A Tranquil Soul\n<BR>\n\n====================\n2. Adept\n------------------------------\n\n#####   One With Nature (20 XP)\nUp until now, you've managed to 'sort of' meditate properly: you're almost sitting still, you're mostly not distracted. Becoming one with nature requires a higher level of discipline.\n\nThe phenomenon commonly described as being 'one with nature' is where a person is so still, so unresponsive, that the world's ambient chakra can flow unhindered through their chakra coils, as if they were just another tree or current of wind.\n\nAs this takes place, nature chakra builds up within the shinobi's chakra system. While there are dangers associated with it, they don't manifest at this level. Every 5 IC you spend meditating, you get one nature chakra counter (NC). You may have a maximum of up to (RES+CHA)/4 nature chakra counters.\n\nHowever: If your meditation is broken through any means other than an End Meditation action (or, once you have the ability, activating Sage Mode), you lose all your accumulated nature chakra counters.\n\nOnce a person stops meditating, this chakra is quickly cycled through their system and disposed of. You lose one NC every 5 IC when not meditating.\n######   Requires: Path to Tranquility\n<BR>\n\n\n#####   Body of Metal (20 XP)\nNature is unyielding; it is powerful, and will crush any who think themselves its better. For every NC you currently have, your damage bonuses are increased by 0.1 with everything but weapons; with weapons, your damage bonus is increased by 0.1 for every 2 NC you currently have.\n\n\n#####   Body of Water (20 XP)\nNature is adaptable; it changes to meet the needs of its current situation, not because it yields, but because it will always be victorious under any circumstances. After seeing the result of a Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina roll, you may spend 3 NC to increase the result by 1; there is no limit on how many NC you may spend this way on a single roll.\n\n\n#####   Body of Fire (20 XP)\nNature is furious; it destroys, it obliterates. It is the raging wildfire, the roar of thunder. You may spend NC to increase your damage bonus by a single attack, at the rate of 0.3 for every NC spent, or 0.1 for each NC spent with weapon attacks. You may increase your base damage bonus by up to 25% of its base value using Body of Fire.\n\n\n#####   Body of Wood (20 XP)\nNature is patient; it grows slowly, knowing that there is no need to rush, that the destination is what matters, not the time taken to get there. When taking any action, you may spend up to 5 NC to improve the result of any Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls it causes you to make. Every NC spent gives you +1 to that roll's result.\n\n\n#####   Body of Earth (20 XP)\nNature is gentle; it nourishes, it strengthens, and it protects. While flowing through your chakra coils it infuses every bit of your body, reinforcing your skin, bones, muscles, and nerves. Every NC you currently have gives a Damage Reduction (DR) of 2.\n\n\n#####   A Dream of a Dream (20 XP)\nEvery person alters the flow of chakra around them in a unique, distinctive way; some people brighten the world merely by being there, while others darken, and still others are like deep pits from which no light can escape.\n\nWhen you sense someone using A Dream of the World, you can identify their chakra in the future. Having met someone in the past doesn't mean you can immediately identify their chakra.\n######   Requires: A Dream of the World\n<BR>\n\n====================\n3. Sage\n------------------------------\n\n#####   Path to Inner Peace (50 XP)\nBefore, your meditation was almost childish: what you thought was perfection was in truth a tribute to its own flawed nature. What you thought was a deep understanding of the world was an immature attempt to define something which no words could hope to describe. What you thought was control of your own body was only ignorance of your own lack of discipline.\n\nYou're not sure when you realized how wrong you've been--it was simply... apparent, one day, an epiphany. Understanding your flaws, you have not overcome them, but rather accepted them, absorbed them into yourself, and in doing so let them dissolve like shadows in the light.\n\nAll meditation effects take place twice as quickly: you gain 1 NC every 2 IC spent meditating, you may use Tranquil Soul every 10 IC, A Dream of the World's radius increases by 2 yards every IC, and so forth.\n\nAdditionally, you can at this point talk to others without breaking your meditation.\n######   Requires: One With Nature, Basic Training 5, Hold Back 5\n<BR>\n\n\\page\n\n#####   Sage Mode (50 XP)\nThe pinnacle of senjutsu--&quot;sage techniques&quot;--is, appropriately enough, referred to as &quot;sage mode&quot;. Activating sage mode requires flawless self-control.\n\nSage mode requires perfectly balancing sage chakra with one's own &quot;yin and &quot;yang&quot; chakra--two things that most ninja never even need to concern themselves with. By drawing in enough nature chakra and maintaining it in perfect harmony, a heightened state of superhuman performance, the eponymous sage mode, can be reached.\n\nYou may activate sage mode as a Speed 5 action once you have at least 50 NC stored, and only if you are Meditating. Doing so immediately ends your meditation, and you may not meditate again until Sage Mode has ended.\n\nSage Mode lasts until you run out of NC; however, while it is active you lose 2 NC every 5 IC (instead of 1). While in Sage Mode, your current NC (for the purpose of determining benefits from nature chakra's passive effects, such as Body of Earth and Body of Metal) is always considered to be the amount you had when you entered Sage Mode.\n\nFor example, if you entered Sage Mode with 60 NC, and had spent 40 of them, you would still receive (60*2) 120 Damage Reduction from Body of Earth, until your Sage Mode expired.\n\n###### Requires: Path to Inner Peace\n<BR>\n\n#####   Awakening: Water (20 XP)\nWhile in Sage Mode, you have a +1 bonus to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls for every 10 NC you had when you activated Sage Mode. After seeing the result of an attack (whether it hits or not) or a defensive roll (successful or not), you may improve the result by up to 3 by spending NC, at the rate of 5 NC per +1.\n\n\n#####   Awakening: Fire (30 XP)\nWhen using Body of Fire in Sage Mode, every 1 NC spent increases your damage bonus by 0.5, or 0.2 for weapon attacks, to a maximum of 50% of your base damage bonus.\n\n\n#####   Awakening: Earth (20 XP)\nWhile in Sage Mode, your damage reduction from Body of Earth cannot be bypassed or reduced by effects which would normally do so. When an attack wounds you, you may spend nature chakra counters to lower its severity, at the rate of 5 NC per level: for example, for 15 NC you could negate a Severe wound entirely.\n\n\n#####   Awakening: Air (20 XP)\nWhile in Sage Mode, you have a +1 bonus to Accuracy and dodge for every 20 NC you entered Sage Mode with. For every 10 NC, you have a +1 bonus to Athletics, Awareness, Chakra Control, and Resistance rolls.\n\n\n#####   Awakening: Void (40 XP)\nWhen in Sage Mode, A Dream of the World and A Dream of a Dream are both automatically active at all times, with a radius of your Sage Mode NC (if you entered with 54 NC, 54 yards). As a Speed 5 action you may make a Chakra Control roll to locate all hidden enemies in range, with a +1 bonus for every 10 NC you have.\n\nIf you've previously located someone this way, during the current instance of Sage Mode, this bonus is raised to +1 for every 5 NC you have (in other words, it's easier to find them after the first time, until your Sage Mode ends).\n######   Requires: A Dream of a Dream</text>\n<BR>\n\n\\page\n# Summoning Contracts\n\n>1. Introduction\n2. How They Work\n3. Avatars\n4. Limitations\n5. How To Read\n6. Breach of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Introduction\n------------------------------\n\nThere are some things even stranger than ninja who can manipulate chakra to give themselves superhuman abilities: for examples, animals who can manipulate chakra to give themselves superhuman abilities. These animals are commonly called &quot;summon creatures&quot; by shinobi, as that is how they will usually be encountered: by another ninja summoning them.\n\nAnimals are summoned for numerous reasons, such as aiding in battle or, more frequently, performing something they can do better than the ninja calling them. The vast majority of these animals have human-level intelligence and performance well beyond what would be expected of their species, and most of them can speak fluently. Exactly where these intelligent, talking, chakra-manipulating animals came from is a mystery even to shinobi.\n\nThat being said, ninja tend to be pragmatic about these matters. There are two things a shinobi needs to summon: knowledge of the technique (Kuchiyose no Jutsu), and a contract.\n\nA contract is exactly that: a piece of paper which the ninja must sign their name to (typically in blood). Once the contract is signed, they gain the ability to summon the corresponding animal at will. In exchange, the ninja must give up some of their own chakra whenever they call the animal.\n\nThese contracts are supernatural in nature; they cannot be destroyed (rather, if they are, they'll reform without any signs of damage). A ninja may summon any contract they've signed, and dismiss it, at will; some carry the contracts with them as a fashion statement or means of showing off, while others prefer to keep them out of sight so as not to tip their hand to prospective enemies. Either way, the physical contract is not needed to actually summon the animal it corresponds to.\n\n====================\n2. How They Work\n------------------------------\n\nYou get the contract by purchasing the Summoning Contract talent.\n\nAfter that, what exactly it allows you to do depends on your XP total. In each contract's description there will be a section labeled &quot;Access&quot;, beneath which you will see XP amounts and the names of individual summons and techniques granted by the contract. Once you have the listed XP amount, you may use the appropriate summon; there is no additional cost to acquire them once you have the contract.\n\nOnce you have a contract and access to a particular summon, you may call on it. To do this, you need to use Kuchiyose no Jutsu (a C-rank ninjutsu); the Chakra cost, Speed, and so forth, are all listed within the entries for individual summons.\n\nSummoned animals are not pets. At best, they are allies who happen to be on friendly terms with their summoner. If you summon a creature to perform its duty, it will do so without (much) complaining. However, it won't casually &quot;hang around&quot;, train with you, or be eye candy. If you try to ask it to do so, it will just leave.\n\n====================\n3. Avatars\n------------------------------\n\nAs mentioned, these intelligent animals have their own social structures; most are fairly loose, and not organized in any fashion particularly recognizable to humans. One thing they all have in common, however, is the presence of what ninja have come to refer to as an &quot;avatar-class&quot; summon.\n\nAvatars are the pinnacle of their species. They may not, strictly speaking, rule the other animals summoned by their contract, but they are universally revered and deferred to. In most cases avatars are more intelligent, and vastly more powerful, than any of the other animals of their species. They also tend to grow to enormous sizes, even beyond what's seen in other summon animals (though this is not necessarily always true, and many avatars are not actually the largest example of the species).\n\nThey're also astoundingly long-lived. Many of the avatars have been alive for over a century, and are likely to live quite a great deal longer still. It's even said that some of them have, in the past, fought against the legendary bijuu--and while they may not have won, the fact that they're still alive says a great deal.\n\nAvatars are also much more independent than the other animals their contracts call. Summoning one does not mean that it will help you. Certainly, some will; others may only do so for certain requests, or under certain circumstances, or with an expectation of something in return.\n\nIn game terms, what this means is that a GM must be around whenever you summon an avatar; they will handle the details of the above.\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n4. Limitations\n------------------------------\n\nThe greatest limitation in most summons is how frequently they can be used. Each individual summon may only be called upon once per week, unless specified otherwise. For example, if you had the Bird contract and summoned the Corpse-Devouring Crows, you coldn't use that particular technique for an IC week (OOC day); on the other, you could still summon an Owl Sage or Flawless Messenger.\n\nAdditionally, summons will not directly work against someone with their contract. The techniques granted by a summoning contract can still be used, but the full-fledged &quot;Summons&quot; of the contract will refuse to act in a battle between contract-holders.\n\nBeyond that, you may under normal circumstances have only one summoning contract, unless you take the Multiple Summonin Contracts talent.\n\n====================\n5. How To Read\n------------------------------\n\nThere are some similarities in most summoning contracts; this is here to clarify what things mean, and help you understand them better!\n\nContracts offer two things: Techniques and Summons. For something listed as a Technique, you are summoning animals to accomplish a single, specific task. For example, in the Snake contract, the &quot;Hidden Shadow Snake Hands&quot; technique: you summon multiple snakes, they perform an attack, and then they are unsummoned.\n\nThings listed as Summons are animals that will stay around for longer. They'll take actions you ask of them (within reason), and they'll fight alongside you or try to accomplish a goal using their capabilities in less strictly-defined ways. Each Summon will have its own node describing it. These are all summoned by performing Kuchiyose no Jutsu (C-rank General Ninjutsu). The Chakra cost, Speed, and Seal Speed listed in these nodes are the ones used for Kuchiyose no Jutsu's &quot;Variable&quot; values.\n\n\nIn each contract, the first node will be labeled &quot;Info.&quot; This gives a brief overview of the contract, including how it's viewed and how the animals behave. While not mechanically significant, this is important to understand their nature.\n\nBelow that, there will be a section labeled &quot;Access&quot;--this is important. Simply signing a contract will not immediately give you free reign to summon the appropriate animals at will. Summons will only respond to shinobi who they believe are worth their time, or whose chakra is of high enough quality. You must meet the minimum XP listed to use a given technique or summon a specific animal.\n\n====================\n6. Breach of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe &quot;contract&quot; between shinobi and summoned animal is, for the most part, a one-sided thing. The ninja calls the summon when they need its help, the summoned creature renders its services and then leaves. In most cases they ask for very little, if anything at all, in return, beyond the chakra used to call them forth.\n\n...That is, aside from respect. Different animals have different opinions, moods, desires, and idiosyncracies. Powerful summons will often object to being summoned trivially, and hardly any summon will put up with being openly disrespected by its summoner in its presence.\n\nSeveral behaviors constitute 'breach of contract'. For all summons, regardless of contract, the ones below always qualify:\n &gt; Directly attacking your own summoned animal.\n &gt; Injuring it too badly in the crossfire (for example, catching your summon as well as an opponent in an area-of-effect technique). KOing your summon, or dealing enough damage to inflict a Major or higher wound on it (counting any effects that increase damage for the purposes of determining wounds) will qualify.\n &gt; Openly insulting or demeaning your summoned animal. Frustration in combat is acceptable, but berating it is not.\n\nIf a breach of contract occurs, the summoned animal will promptly excuse itself from the battle. That entire summoning contract will be completely unusable for the next three OOC weeks.\n\nMost summoned animals are fairly helpful and even-tempered; in most cases, only the conitions listed above will constitute a breach of contract. Some, however, can be testier. In the individual descriptions of certain summons, there will be a list of additional Breach of Contract conditions. Meeting any of those conditions will constitute an immediate breach of contract, with the effects described above.\n\nNotably, all Avatar-class summons have special Breach of Contract conditions, which are not listed. One must simply assess their personality and, based on that, do one's best not to offend them or earn their ire--sucking up to them may not be all that good of an idea either, as some hate summoners who aren't confident or who spend too much time simpering.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summoning Contracts: Combat\n>1. Introduction\n2. Actions\n3. Damage\n4. Fatigue\n5. Unsummoning\n\n====================\n1. Introduction\n------------------------------\n\nInevitably, ninja will try to call upon their summoned allies in combat, either against other ninja or to counter other summoned creatures. Accordingly, the combat-worthy summons have functional stat blocks for when this comes up.\n\n====================\n2. Actions\n------------------------------\n\nWhen in battle with their summoner, a summoned creature's actions should be tracked normally: if it takes a Speed 14 action on IC 50, it cannot act again until IC 64. However, unlike a normal person, summons do not act automatically. They will only take actions when directed by their summoner (this can be the character doing it, by shouting out instructions, or the summoned creature choosing what to do, controlled by the player). Acting this way usually has an AP cost: the summoner spends a certain amount of their own AP, and the animal takes the appropriate action.\n\nAP can be spent to lower the Speed of their actions, again paid by the user. Summons to not accumulate AP on their own. They do not have Willpower unless specifically stated, and the summoner may not spend Willpower on their behalf.\n\nIf the summon is acting alone (for example, stalling enemies) while its summoner is not involved in combat, it can act without having to pay AP to do so. It accumulates its own AP at the rate of 5 every 20 IC, which it can use normally.\n\n====================\n3. Damage\n------------------------------\n\nTechnically, summons have HP. However, once they reach 0 Vitality they will automatically vanish in a puff of smoke, being un-summoned. This means that it's impossible to actually kill a summoned creature (they *can* die--you just have to track them down &quot;in person&quot;, which is typically more trouble than it's worth).\n\nSummons don't suffer from wounds.\n\n====================\n4. Fatigue\n------------------------------\n\nSummons do not have Fatigue levels, as such, though they still make Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and accumulate penalties to those rolls, normally. Instead, whenever a summon fails a Fatigue roll its penalties reset normally and it automatically loses 20% of its maximum Vitality.\n\nThis is part of representing how, as discussed in Damage, summons disappear once they're no longer able to fight: it doesn't really matter if they're worn out by overexertion or by being beaten on too heavily, one way or another they're not able  to go on.\n\n====================\n5. Unsummoning\n------------------------------\n\nIf you are ever in a position where you want to unsummon one of your summoned things, all it takes is a Speed 5 action and poof! You can unsummon any single summon, or even multiple summoned things all at once.</text>\n\n\\page\n## Bird Contract\n\nIn many ways, summoned birds are closer to their natural kin than most of the other chakra-enhanced summon animals. Few of them speak human languages, and in most cases they are being called upon to do something birds already would, just quicker and more effectively.\n\nAs a species, birds ard neither friendly nor kind--but neither are they malicious or dismissive. They're proud, but willing to respect anyone who will afford them the same. While they are be no mean pacifists or even averse to violence, they are not, as a whole, particularly well-suited to combat, which is enough for many ninja to steer away from them.\n\nOn the other hand, they can be quite useful in other ways, in no small part because they can fly. Additionally, many of the summoned birds bear a stronger resemblance to their naturally-occurring brethren than other summon animals do to theirs, which often allows summoned birds to go unnoticed when other creatures wouldn't.\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n###### 800 XP: Flawless Messenger\n###### 1200 XP: Corpse Devouring Crows\n###### 1600 XP: Summon: Raven\n###### 2000 XP: Summon: Owl\n###### 2400 XP: Graceful Sky Emissary\n###### 4500 XP: Summon: Amahaou\n###### 6000 XP: Summon: Garuda</text>\n\n## Techniques\n### --( Kanzen Shisha - Flawless Messenger )--\nThis summons a small to medium-sized bird, though not a bird of prey. The bird will accept a written message from its summoner, wait to be told where to delier that message to, and then fly off to deliver it.\n\nFor obvious reasons, these birds are quite popular with ninja who use the bird-summoning contract: they make excellent, efficient, and precise messengers, with almost no risk of being intercepted, and none at all of being bribed, subverted, or double agents.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nThe bird will accept an envelope, a small scroll, or sheets of paper. After taking the message, it will wait until you instruct it where that message should be delivered, which can be any person you know or place you've been.\n\nThe bird will then fly off. If in combat, it flies 5 yards per IC for the first 100 IC, and can't be targeted by anything with a range of less than 20. After that, the speed increases to 10 yardsper IC and it can't be reached by anything with a range of less than 100 yards. (Other flying enemies, however, have no such restrictions on attacking them)\n\nOut of combat, the bird flies at 30 miles an hour. If it's attacked, it has +25 dodge, and can take only 50 damage before being unsummoned. If it was sent with a handwritten message, the message will disappear with it; anything else (such as a sealed scroll) will be dropped.\n\nThe bird will, after circling aimlessly for a while, fly towards its specified destination. Attempting to follow the bird is impossible from the ground. If it cannot reach the intended recipient (because they're dead, or in a jail cell with no windows, for example) it will come as close as it can, wait around for a week, and then disappear.\n\nOne of this technique's downsides is that there's no way for the summoner to tell if the message was delivered successfully. Furthermore, it may only be used once every month (4 OOC days).\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Shitai Musabori no Karasu - Corpse Devouring Crows )--\nA rarely-used aspect of the bird-summoning contract, though one that's seen a fair deal of popularity among the ANBU corps of various villages, it summons (despite its name) a murder of crows, a wake of vultures, or group of other appropriate carrion-eating bird.\n\nThe birds will swarm the area, devouring any recently-dead bodies without leaving a single trace of their passing.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + 3 * X\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nThe birds will completely consume 1 + X human-sized corpses (or multiple smaller corpses, or part of a lower number of larger corpses) in a matter of minutes. The birds are incredibly thorough, and will leave absolutely no trace of the individual behind, even cleaning up any blood that hasn't had time to dry.\n\nThus, if you brutally murdered someone in their bedroom, and got blood all over the inside of the place, you could open a window and summon the birds, who would make it look as if the murder never took place--as long as the blood hadn't had time to dry and stain things. (Place might still be a mess, though).\n\nThe birds can be summoned indoors, but only if there's easy access to the outdoors nearby; an open window or door, for example.\n\n\\page\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Yuugana Sukai-Shisha - Graceful Sky Emissary )--\nYou summon a very large eagle or a giant hawk, which lifts you up and carries you a short distance before leaving. While certainly very showy, the situations where having a giant bird carry you only a short distance is actually useful are fewer than one may think.\n\nEven so, it does have its uses, such as crossing chasms or otherwise dangerous terrain. Also, the eagle will carry its summoner to solid ground even if that would be beyond its normal range, so it's pretty handy after getting thrown off a cliff.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25 + 5 * X\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nThe eagle (or giant hawk) will pick up you and up to one other person to carry, who must be within 5 yards of one another. You need to hold on, which means that for the duration of the trip at least one of your arms will be occupied at all times holding the eagle's legs.\n\nAlso, worth noting: the eagle can actually support the weight of about four people, so one common trick is to have two ninja hold onto the backs of two others, and then summon the eagle to carry each pair.\n\nThe eagle flies up 4 + X - Y yards per IC, up to a maximum of 6. Y is the number of people the eagle is carrying. Once it drops its passengers off, it is unsummoned. The eagle will cary its passengers for up to 50 IC (or until told it reaches the summoner's destination). If it isn't over solid ground at that point, it will fly to the nearest safe location before dropping them off. On the other hand, if the summoner asks it to drop them in mid-air it will do so.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Raven\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nRavens are known to be exceptionally intelligent for birds, able to create tools and recognize faces, and summoned ravens are even more so. Most subspecies are hard to differentiate, and so they seldom look out of place when flying over an area.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nDespite being very clever, ravens don't talk. Or, it might be accurate to say they don't speak.\n\nThey are able to communicate ideas to their summoner. After returning from scouting, it will perch somewhere the summoner can see it (on a tree stump, on a forearm if one is offered, and so forth) and begin tilting its head, pecking aimlessly with its peak, and shifting from side to side. Anyone looking at it will be able to tell it's doing something unusual, but the summoner will actually understand what it's &quot;saying.&quot;\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 200\n<br> STR: 10\n<br> RES: 10\n<br> CHA: 10\n<br> DEX: 40\n<br> AGI: 50\n\n<br>Accuracy: 30\n<br>Dodge: +20\n<br>Movement: 5 yards per IC\n\n<br>Awareness: +20\n<br>Espionage: +25\n<br>Stealth: +30\n\n\n###### Enhanced Vision\nRavens ignore bonuses to Stealth TNs based on Stealth level. For example, if someone was in Stealth 3 with a Stealth TN of 45, it would be treated only as 30 for the raven (as it ignores the +15 from Stealth 3).\n\n###### Independent Action\nThe raven can act competently without guidance from its summoner. None of its actions require AP to perform, and when given general instructions (&quot;scout the area&quot;, &quot;see if you can find any clues&quot;) it will do so to the best of its ability.\n\n###### Flight\nBy default, the raven is airborne; it may land or take off as a Speed 10 action. When airborne, it cannot be targeted by any attacks with a range of less than 100 yards. After descending to Steal (see below) an item, it is effectively 0 yards from the ground; it regains 3 yards of altitude every IC. Melee attacks can reach it only if the attacker can move (i.e. jump) far enough to reach the raven as part of their attack.\n\\page\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nRavens may use Dodge and Move as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB.\n\n\n###### Scout (Speed N/A)\nThe raven leaves to scout the area. Depending on the radius of the area it's told to scout, how long it will take varies.\n25 yards: 30 seconds\n50 yards: 2 minutes\n100 yards: 5 minutes\n200 yards: 10 minutes\nThe raven will make an Awareness check against everyone and everything in the area. It will then report back to its summoner. It can communicate basic concepts, such as number and location of people; presence of buildings, carriages, and obvious traps; and so forth. It can make basic guesses about people based on their appearance: a group of four people leaping through trees are probably ninja, the people working in the rice fields are probably farmers, and so forth. It requires a break of at least twice as long as it spent scouting before it will go scout the area again.\n\n###### Spy (Speed N/A)\nAfter finding something while scouting, or given instructions by its summoner (like, &quot;wait here&quot;), the raven will go to an area and do something appropriately bird-like, such as perching nearby or pecking at the ground. It will wait there until a condition, specified by the summoner is met, then fly back and alert its summoner. A good example would be, &quot;Go watch the group you saw camped out in the woods, let me know if any of them leave.&quot; Anyone being spied upon for more than two minutes can make an Awareness roll against the raven's Espionage to realize that it's behaving unnaturally for a bird.\n\n###### Steal (Speed 15)\nRavens may pick up any small, unattended objects, or minor things like shiny buttons on people's coats or lightweight pieces of headgear. If instructed by their summoner, they can go for specific items; if not, they'll pick up whatever is most useful (a discarded kunai to let their summoner know that ninja are ahead, for example) or, failing that, shiniest. Stopping the raven from stealing something requires an Awareness roll (to notice it) and then an Accuracy roll against its accuracy (to grab the item before it can), both of which are allowed of anyone within 10 yards of whatever it's trying to steal.\n\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nWhen summoned, the raven will stay around until the next time the sun sets (in other words, the rest of the day) or until it's badly injured enough to be unsummoned.\n\nIf dispatched by being injured, another raven cannot be summoned for two months (8 OOC days). If dismissed at sundown or by the summoner, it can be called once a week (OOC day) as normal.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Owl Sage\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nA large forest owl, about two feet 'tall' from its talons to the top of its head when perched, with alert yellow-orange eyes. The owl is quite wise, and moderately eccentric. It's also the only summonable bird (aside from the avatar) which can speak to humans.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25 + X * 3\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nThe owl can only be summoned in areas where it can reach the open sky (so, not in caves), and will only come if there's somewhere it can perch above eye level for its summoner (such as a tree branch or the top of a short pole). However, this location must still be close enough for casual conversations, without it or the summoner having to raise their voices.\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nIf the owl's summoner deliberately tries to &quot;one up&quot; it by going higher or growing larger than the owl is high, it becomes offended and flies away.\n\nUnlike most birds, the owl is capable of speaking human language. It actually claims that most of the other summoned birds can, but choose not to (the validity of this claim is dubious at best). It has a soft-spoken, cultured manner of speaking, though it avoids sounding pretentious or trying to talk over the head of its summoner (figuratively; literally, it certainly does so).\n\nBeyond its curious fixation on having the highest elevation in any situation it finds itself in, the owl is quite agreeable and helpful, if disconcertingly prone to turning its head upside-down or in a full circle when talking.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 600\n\n<br> STR: 20\n<br> RES: 40\n<br> CHA: 20\n<br> DEX: 60\n<br> AGI: 60\n\n<br> Accuracy: 28\n<br> Dodge: +32\n<br> Movement: 4 yards per IC\n\n<br> Awareness: +20\n<br> Espionage: +20\n<br> Medicine: +15\n<br> Research: +30\n<br> Stealth: +25\n<br> Toxicology: +20\n\n<BR>\n\n###### Busy\nThe owl will perform a total of X actions (from Abilities) before leaving. This can be the same action multiple times. Standard Actions do not count.\n\n###### Flight\nBy default, the owl will find somewhere to perch; it may take off or land as a Speed 10 action. When airborne, it altitude automatically increases by 3 yards every IC, to a maximum of 100 yards. It cannot be targeted by any attacks with a range of less than its altitude. Melee attacks can reach it only if the attacker can move (i.e. jump) far enough to reach the owl as part of their attack. After using its Distract or Disarm actions it is considered 0 yards from the ground, and will then regain altitude accordingly.\n\n###### Night Vision\nOwls ignore all darkness-based visibility penalties.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\nStandard Actions\nOwls can use Move, Dodge, and Search.\n\n\n###### Disarm (Speed 10, 6 AP)\nThe owl swoops down and tries to grab something an enemy is holding, then fly away with it! The enemy defends against this as if it was a normal disarm attempt. If they fail, the owl takes whatever weapon they had and flies up with it. The owl will drop it 15 IC later, at which point it can be retrieved.\n\n\n###### Distract (Speed X, 5+X/2 AP)\nThe owl flies around someone's face, generally being a nuisance! This imposes a -4 visibility penalty on the person being distracted due to the large bird flapping in front of their face and making obnoxious hooting noises.\n\nThis penalty lasts for X IC, or until the owl takes at least 100 damage. It can also be broken prematurely by moving 20 yards or more in 5 IC or less (by simply getting away from the owl). Until the Distraction ends (for any of those reasons), the owl will not regain altitude.\n\\page\n\n\n\n###### Erudite (N/A)\nYou may ask the owl to make a Research roll for you on any topic, either in place of making one yourself or in hopes of getting a better result than you did with your own roll. It can also make knowledge-based Medicine or Toxicology rolls (though please don't try asking the owl to perform first aid on someone--it never ends well).\n\n\n###### Knowledge (N/A)\nOwls are quite the impressive scholars (apparently), even about matters related to ninja. After seeing any jutsu used, or even hearing it described by someone who saw it, it can identify the technique and all pertinent information about it (rank, effects, possible workarounds, and so forth). The same applies to the abiliies of any ninja clans and bloodlines. Each technique it's asked about counts as one use of this ability, each clan counts as two.\n\nNote that for clans, it will provide general information: &quot;Yamanaka can enter the minds of their enemies and control their actions, but the damage to the possessed individual carries over to the original body,&quot; for example. It would not provide an exhaustive breakdown of evey ability possessed by the clan, unless each was asked as a separate question (requiring the summoner to have at least enough familiarity with the techniques to describe them to the owl).\n\n\n###### Scout (Speed 0, 10 AP)\nThe owl will scout an area for its summoner. Out of battle this has no Speed or AP cost, takes 10 minutes, and covers an area with a 100 yard radius. The owl will report back with what it found (it makes an Awareness roll against everyone and everything in the area).\n\nUsed in combat, it uses the listed Speed and AP and attempts to find a hidden enemy. It will continually perform Search actions until the enemy (or enemies) it was asked to find are discovered or break stealth. Once it finds them, it will, as a Speed 0 action, Point Out whoever it found (as per the rules in Combat -&gt; Stealth).\n\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nNormally, the owl can be called once every two weeks. If involved in combat at all, it cannot be summoned again for four weeks. If injured, this is raised to six; and if it loses all its Vitality, it cannot be summoned again for three months (12 OOC days).</text>\n\n\n\n\\page \n\n## Summon: Amahou\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nSky Kings, as they are called, are tremendous snow-white eagles with wingspans of several hundred feet, capable of shadowing battlefields when they fly overhead. Each of their feathers is as long as a person is tall, and they're strong enough to trivially lift up the largest of (mundane) land animals. Of all the known summon creatures, they are by far the physically largest.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Speed: 40\n  -  Seal Speed: 35\n\nThe Amahaou can only be summoned outdoors, in areas large enough for it to spread its wings and take flight.\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nAs is the case with most summoned birds, Sky Kings cannot speak any language that humans will understand. Even so, they have at least human-level intelligence and can understand complex requests and plans. While it would not be accurate to call them friendly, they willingly have a helpful disposition.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<BR> Vitality: 6000\n\n<br> STR: 160\n<br> RES: 200\n<br> CHA: 100\n<br> DEX: 120\n<br> AGI: 100\n\n<br> Accuracy: 50\n<br> Dodge: N/A\n<br> Damage Bonus: 14\n<br> Movement: 6 yards per IC\n\n<br> Awareness: +30\n<br> Resistance: +25\n<br> Stealth: Yeah, no.\n<BR>\n\n###### Bird of Prey\nAny time an enemy in Stealth moves within a Sky King's shadow (see &quot;Shade&quot;), it automatically sees them regardless of their current Stealth level or Stealth TN. Making any attack, even a ranged weapon attack, from stealth while in its Shade is also enough motion to draw its attention this way.\n\n###### Buffet\nWhenever a Sky King attacks, everyone within its Shade other than the target must make an Athletics roll against a TN of 30 or be immediately Tripped, and Stunned for the next 6 IC.\n\n###### Flight\nUnless they deliberately land (doing so, and taking off again, are both Speed 15 actions), Sky Kings are always considered airborne, and as such ignore effects dependant upon the condition of the ground. When they attack, they are considered to be at ground level. Every IC which bases after they take off or attack, they rise 5 yards straight up, to a maximum of 100 yards. Any attack from the ground must have sufficient range to hit them; melee attacks can be used as long as the attacker can travel that far as part of their attack (by jumping!).\n\n###### Great Bird\nThe area beneath a Sky King in flight is subjected to heavy gusts of wind every time it beats its wings. Within that area (see &quot;Shade&quot;) every time the IC reaches a multiple of 20 all clouds (such as from Mist Blaze Dance, or Hidden Mist Technique) are removed.\n\n\n###### Titanic\nAmahaou cannot dodge area-of-effect attacks; instead, they automatically block them as a Speed 0 defense. Amahaou cannot hide. Multi-throws inflict half damage to an Amahaou. Amahaou are too large to be affected by any jutsu or effects that work by binding or physically immobilizing them. They cannot be grappled by any enemies who are not Huge or larger.\n\nA Sky King cannot dodge any attack with a range greater than its current altitude. This means that it is completely unable to dodge any attack with a maximum range of greater than 100 yards (its maximum atitude). This does mean that it cannot dodge while on the ground.\n\nAttempting to parry the Amahaou's attacks requires either a Strength of 100 or more, or an unarmed physical damage bonus of 10 or greater, as well as both hands free.\n\n\n\\page\n\n\n###### Shade\nWhen in flight, an Amahaou is considered to occupy an area with a 100 yard radius centered on its &quot;actual&quot; location; anyone in that area is effectively in melee range of it (not counting distance from the ground). Anyone below it is immune to any weather-based effects caused by thunderstorms, rain, and so forth.\n\n###### Talons\nA Sky King may grab up to two individuals, one in each claw. It suffers no penalties for being in control of the grapple. Enemies using the Escape Grapple technique have the Speed, Delay, and Stamina cost doubled.\n\n###### Tireless\n###### An Amahou does not need to make Stamina rolls for its actions. If forced to for other reasons (such as Suffocation), it uses +25 for its effective bonus to Fatigue rolls.\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nAmahaou may use Move and Search.\n\n\n###### Crush (Speed 12, 10 AP)\nUsable while on the ground.\nThis may only be used while someone is Pinned by the Amahaou. It deals (damage), which is doubled for the purposes of inflicting (Blunt) wounds, and applies a Suffocation 2 each time it's used.\nCrushing cannot be avoided, and deals no base damage. However, it uses double the Amahaou's standard damage bonus for determining its damage dealt (making it, under normal circumstances, 14*2*10 = 336 damage, raised to 672 for inflicting wounds).\n\n###### Peck (Speed 20, 16 AP)\nUsable while on the ground.\nIt's not actually a peck. It's actually a bite from a titanic bird's equally oversized beak. If this wounds a victim it inflicts both a Blunt (from the crushing force) and Slashing (from... being bitten) wound of the appropriate severity. It deals 20d20 damage, but has a -5 Accuracy penalty. If used against a Pinned opponent, this hits automatically.\n\n###### Pin (Speed 14, 20 AP)\nUsable while in flight.\nThe Amahou simultaneously lands and attacks a single target. If they're hit they must immediately make an Athletics roll against 35 or be Grappled by one of its talons. During this period they're prone and unable to form handseals. The Amahaou may not move without ending the grapple. Even after escaping, whoever was Pinned is prone, as if by the Trip taijutsu.\n\n###### Pluck (Speed 20, 15 AP)\nUsable while in flight.\nThe Amahaou swoops down and snatches up an unfortunate victim. This may target up to two people within its Shade at once, as a single action. People grabbed this way are treated as if held by the E-rank Grab taijutsu. Escaping the grapple results in one falling 5 yards per IC (because calculating actual acceleration due to gravity would not be worth the effort). For every yard they were above 20 when they escaped, they take 1d12+1 damage when they hit the ground. Falling inflicts Blunt wounds. The Amahaou may also drop one or both of the people it's holding, as a (Speed 10, 5 AP) action.\n\n###### Rake (Speed 24, 10 AP)\nUsable while in flight.\nThe Amahou rakes with its claws. It may choose up to two areas ten yards across within its Shade to attack. This attack targets everyone within both those areas, though is not treated as an area-of-effect attack. This deals 4d8*10 damage to anyone it hits.\n\n###### Scratch (Speed 16, 10 AP)\nUsable on the ground.\nThe Amahaou scratches an area within 20 yards with one of its claws. This targets everyone in an area 10 yards across, though is not treated as an area-of-effect attack. It deals 4d6*10 damage to anyone hit by the attack.\n\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\n\nAn Amahaou can only be summoned once every three months (12 OOC days).\n\nWhen one is summoned, it will either aid the summoner in combat, or allow itself to be used as an aerial ferry. In the latter case, it will do so until sunset or sunrise, whichever comes first. It will carry additional passengers, if the summoner wishes.\n\nDue to the Sky King's immense size, falling off isn't much of an issue--a large portion of its back is essentially &quot;flat&quot; when in flight, and its feathers are sturdy enough to easily be used as handholds. Climbing down can be tricky, but not, in most cases, dangerous.\n\nOnce either of those is accomplished, it will depart--it will not help fight off enemies and then carry its summoner to safety, nor will it stay around and help fight after delivering its somewhere where they need to go... unless it's attacked, in which case it will defend itself mercilessly.</text>\n\\page\n\n\n# Avatar Summon: Garuda\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nThe avatar of the birds, the legendary Lord Garuda, takes the form of a bird of no clear species: an eagle-like body structure, an owlish face, a pure-white raven's beak, and the claws of a falcon. His plumage is similarly unique, brilliant gold feathers along his leg, a red-feathered body crossed with gold bands, white tailfeathers, a golden crest, and vibrant blue pinion feathers.\n\n  -  Chakra: 60\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\nPhysically, Garuda is much less imposing than any of the sky kings, though he is still quite large, with a wingspan over a hundred feet across. He's not as large as some of the avatar summons, but he's certainly large enough to dwarf any summoner.\n\nGaruda can speak--or, rather, Garuda can 'speak'. When he does so it is in a soft-spoken, deep, noble voice which is heard in the minds of everyone who he wishes to hear him. He does not talk in the conventional sense, making no actual noise. In short, it's telepathy, or something very much like it.\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nGaruda is calm, even-tempered, and noble. He is righteous, but not kind. He will willingly lend his aid to those who need it for a just cause, but will be reluctant to aid individuals who are merely seeking to advance their own interests or use his power for their personal benefit.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\nAs the avatar of birds Garuda is without equal in the sky, capable of flying with breathtaking grace. He is undoubtedly a fierce combatant, though likely lacks the raw power of some of the larger, land-bound animal avatars.\n\nLegends claim that Garuda himself is genuinely divine to some measure, though what the implications of this may be are unknown.</text>\n\n<img \n  src='http://cdn.pcwallart.com/images/giant-eagle-hobbit-wallpaper-1.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \n\\page\n## Canine Contract\nEver since they were domesticated from feral wolves, dogs have been known as one of mankind's most faithful companions. Even ordinary, non-shinobi dogs are fiercely loyal to their masters, and in Konoha there's an entire clan dedicated to the rearing of shinobi dogs.\n\nThis contract summons a variety of different dogs. The lowest ranks (the ninken; literally &quot;ninja dogs&quot;) are in fact groups of dogs trained in the ninja arts that are loyal to a small group of people. Each major village usually has a few teams of ninken loyal to them, and even the minor villages typically have their own team.\n\nThe two dog spirit summons are literally that: incorporeal spirits, perhaps even ghosts, of dogs. Despite their rather unsettling nature, they are, like the ninken, very helpful and loyal summons, willing to engage in combat or assist as necessary when working towards their summoner's goals.\n\nThat changes at the higher ranks of the contract. The &quot;Mountain Dogs&quot; would be better known as giant wolves. They, and the canine avatar Oguchi-no-Makami, are anything but trusting or subservient. By signing the contract, the summoner has in effect become a member of their pack.\n\nWith the dogs, the summoner is their master; with the wolves, the summoner is a lowly member of their pack. The wolves will fight to defend their pack, viciously and to the death if necessary, but that pack member had best remember their place.\n\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n###### 1000 XP: Summon: Ninken\n###### 1500 XP: Tracking Fang Technique\n###### 2000 XP: Inugami\n###### 3000 XP: Inugami Possession\n###### 4000 XP: Summon: Mountain Dogs\n###### 5000 XP: Summon: Oguchi</text>\n\n## Techniques\n### --( Kuchiyose: Tsuiga no Jutsu - Summoning: Tracking Fang Technique )--\nSummoning all 8 of their Ninken team, the shinobi uses a bit of their own blood to give the dogs a scent trail. Following the scent, the team dives underground and travels to its target. Once there they burst up from the earth and bite down on the target, keeping them immobilized for a short while.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nBefore this technique can be used, you need to get some of your own blood onto the target. This can be accomplished one of two ways. The first, if your opponent has damaged you with a piercing or slashing weapon and is still carrying it, there will be enough blood on it. Alternately, you can cut your hand with a slashing weapon as a Speed 4 action that deals 10 points of damage (which cannot be reduced) to yourself. After doing so, you have 25 IC to hit your target with a basic unarmed attack; if it takes longer than that, you need to cut yourself again.\n\nOnce an enemy has blood on them, Tracking Fang can be used; your ninken team appears by you and dives underground. They will attack your target X/2 IC later, where X is the number of yards that target is from you; if they move away, the time until the dogs attack is increased, but no matter what the ninken team will eventually find them. No penalties other than Fatigue are applied to your Accuracy with this technique. Similarly, you can use this against someone who you can't see (because they're in stealth) as long as they've been marked. Being hit by Tracking Fang will immediately remove a stealthed individual from stealth.\n\nWhen the dogs do attack, it is defended against as if it was whatever Speed this technique was when you performed it. If it hits, the target suffers a -8 immobilization penalty, and you and they both roll Survival. The penalty lasts for 2 IC for every point you beat their Survival roll by, with a minimum of 10 IC.\n\nIf the victim takes a total of 300 or more points of area-of-effect damage (before reductions), the effect ends immediately, and all of your ninken are unable to be summoned for four weeks (as discussed in Summons -&gt; Ninken -&gt; Terms of Contract).\n\\page\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Inugami - Summoning: Dog Spirit )--\nThe Inugami is said to be created by the death of a starving dog buried up to its neck and left to die with food just out of reach. As the myth goes, the spirit will then serve its former master, but at times will remember how its life ended and turn upon whoever bound it to that fate.\n\nWhether or not there's any truth in that story, the canine contract does provide the ability to summon these spirits. They look like elongated, white-bodied dogs with brown heads and paws. They don't speak, and aren't affectionate by any means, but will serve the shinobi who summoned them faithfully. After being called it flies towards its unfortunate victim and vanishes into their body.\n\n  -  Chakra: 24\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\nEffects:\nChoose a single target to be cursed by the Inugami. While cursed, the target suffers a -3 penalty to Accuracy and their d20 rolls. This includes Accuracy, defenses, skill rolls, and Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion--but not damage for attacks which roll d20s for damage.\n\nThis penalty lasts until the target rolls a natural 15 or higher on one of their affected d20 rolls, at which point the curse is broken. If they roll a natural 20 while affected by the curse, it is instead reflected upon the shinobi who summoned the Inugami, who must then break it by the normal means. (If they in turn roll a natural 20, it is once more reflected upon the victim, until someone breaks it without rolling a 20).\n\nNotably, there is no defense against this curse; it cannot be dodged, blocked, or so on.\n\n```\n```\n\n\n<img \n  src='http://media.animevice.com/uploads/0/4479/401739-eightninjadogs_1.png' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Inugami Hyoukyo - Dog Spirit Possession )--\nNot only is the Inugami able to curse an enemy but it can also take over a person's body. Ordinarily, this is incredibly difficult to do; however, if a shinobi wishes it they may willingly give themselves over to possession by the Inugami. While ordinary people possessed by an Inugami begin to act like dogs themselves, shinobi are able to stave off the worst of that.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20+2*X\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nThe severity of any Bleed, Paralysis, and Poison effects you are suffering from is reduced by X for the duration of the possession. If this reduces a Poison to 0, it will not automatically negate any other effects of that poison. Every 10 IC you recover X Hit Points, or X Vitality if you aren't missing any Hit Points.\n\nAny time you take an action and roll a 5 or less on a d20, you suffer from a Stun 5 effect after the action is completed, as you must struggle to maintain control of your mind and not succumb to the spirit's canine instincts.</text>\n\n\\page\n## Summon: Ninjken\n\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. The Eight\n6. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nEach of the ninken teams has a distinct uniform signifying their village orientation, and yes, dogs wearing forehead protectors or shirts with village insignia does look ridiculous. From there, each of the 8 dogs is usually of a breed that would be well suited to their chosen specialty. The ninken teams seem to be separated by village and also by generations. What this means is that the team of ninken your grandpa summoned are not the ones you're going to be summoning. \n\n  -  Chakra:15 + X * 3 + Y * 5\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\n&quot;X&quot; is the number of Ninken you are summoning at once, and &quot;Y&quot; is the number of times you have used Kuchiyose no Jutsu to summon your ninken in the past week (OOC day).\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nNinken are some of the most loyal of all summons, and in most cases are happy to help their summoners. Even if mildly abused, the ninken will continue to do what their summoners ask.\n\nThey're talking dogs that use ninja skills, what's not to love?!\n\nNo ninken are poodles, chihuahuas, or other small, annoying, yappy dogs.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 600\n\n<br> STR: 50\n<br> RES: 50\n<br> CHA: 30\n<br> DEX: 50\n<br> AGI: 50\n\n<br> Accuracy: 21\n<br> Dodge: +11\n<br> Damage Bonus: 3.3\n<br> Movement: 2 yards per IC.\n\n<br> Athletics: +10\n<br> Awareness: +10\n<br> Chakra Control: +10\n<br> Espionage: +10\n<br> Resistance: +10\n<br> Stealth: +10\n<br> Survival: +15\n<BR>\n\n###### Ninja Training\nDespite not having enough Chakra Control, each of the Ninken has the equivalent of the abilities Wall Walking and Water Walking. \n\n###### Tireless\nNinken do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when they act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +5 to their rolls.\n\n###### Tracking Fang Technique\nIf the shinobi uses the Tracking Fang Technique jutsu while one or more ninken are present on the battlefield, they will all burrow underground. They are effectively removed from combat until the end of that technique's duration, at which point they return to fight normally. Rather than immediately un-summoning themselves after taking 300 damage (as would be normal for Tracking Fang), they take damage normally (though taking that much damage will still end Tracking Fang, as discussed in its effects).\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions (Speed as normal)\nThis Summon may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n\n###### Bite (Speed 10, AP 6)\nThe standard method of attack for a canine is the bite and takedown, something they've been doing for millenia. Attacking at the feet and legs, this counts as a basic unarmed attack and inflicts 4d10 Blunt damage. If the canine succeeds by 5 or more, it can make a automatic grapple check. If the canine wins the grapple check, the opponent does not suffer the normal penalties for being grabbed, but may break free using the normal methods; the main purpose of this is enabling use of the Takedown ability (below).\n\n\n###### Takedown (Speed 6, AP 8)\nAfter getting a good bite down on an opponent, the canine gives a good shake and tug, aiming to drag their target down to the ground. This can be used while the canine is grappling a foe, make a grapple check, if succesful the target is knocked prone and still trapped in the grapple. A prone person has -3 accuracy, -2 to defensive actions, and moves at reduced speed (check grapple, or half if the canine loses the grapple).\n\n\\page\n\n\n###### Track (Speed 20, AP 5)\nThe canine uses their superior senses, usually those of smell, to track down their quarry. This uses a survival roll with a +5 bonus to follow tracks towards a target. The difficulty of the check is based on the conditions. A standard non-ninja requires only a 15 to track. A shinobi normally requires a 20, but if they are trying to cover their tracks they get an opposed survival check, or a stealth check at -5. For each day old the track is the difficulty to track increases by +2. Rain or shifting ground conditions imposes a +5. Heavy rainfall, mudslides, or tracking over running water imposes a +10.\n\nUsed in combat, this is a Survival roll with a +5 bonus against the Stealth TN of any hidden individuals. The dog may then Point Out whoever they've found, as per the normal rules for that action.\n\n\n====================\n5. The Eight\n------------------------------\n\n###### The Leader\nThe most charismatic of most Ninken teams, the leader can act without using the summoner's AP. \n\n###### The Brute\nCalled for when a little muscle is needed, the Brute has a STR of 90, a Damage Bonus of 6.0, and a +5 bonus to grapple rolls.\n\n###### Bloodhound\nIn addition to following tracks, the Bloodhound can also be given a bit of blood from a bleeding target or a garment of clothing with the target's scent to follow. Additionally, the bloodhound can use survival instead of awareness to notice a target in stealth. The bloodhound has a +10 bonus to its Survival rolls, and in combat does not need to spend the summoner's AP to use its Track ability.\n\n###### Bombsniffer\nThe Bombsniffer can use Survival to check for traps rather than Awareness or Espionage, and has a +5 bonus to doing so. In addition, it can sniff the remains of a detonated explosion and attempt to track the one who prepared or detonated the explosive tags. \n\n###### Scout\nThe Scout has an Awareness skill of +15. It may use the Search and Point Out actions (as described in Chapter 3) without using any of the summoner's AP. It uses Search as a Speed 4 action.\n\n###### Tiny\nThe Tiny dog has a Stealth skill of +20, and can use its Bite attack without breaking Stealth, though each time it does so its Stealth TN is reduced by 5. It may use the Hide and Improve Hiding abilities as described in Chapter 3, without spending any of the summoner's AP. It can hide from anyone who is suffering from a -4 or greater visibility penalty.\n\n###### Acrobat\nThe Acrobat is fast and agile, having an Athletics skill of +15, a movement speed of 3 yards per IC, and a dodge bonus of +16 (in place of the normal +11, not on top of it).\n\n###### Spy\nThe Spy is a master of disguise and manipulation, having an Espionage skill of +15 and also the unique ability to use the ninjutsu art of Henge no Jutsu, though doing so has a Chakra cost of 15, and it cannot be maintained for more than half an hour.\n\n====================\n6. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe ninken are a very laid-back and devoted group of creatures, showing extreme loyalty in most cases to their summoners. As such, they're usually fine with whatever task needs to be done, unless the summoner wants one of them to risk their life for the summoner's own material gain.\n\nThey're also one of the few summons that will fight other animals of the same contract. Ninken will work against shinobi who've signed the canine contract, and even other ninken teams, as long as they're from a different village; a team of Sand ninken will have no problem fighting a team of Leaf ninken and their master.\n\nThat said, regardless of village affiliations the ninken will have nothing to do with the Mountain Dogs or Oguchi-no-Makami. If either of those are summoned into battle against them, the ninken will promptly flee with their tails between their legs and unsummon themselves.\n\nUnlike most summons, you can also summon ninken repeatedly in the same week (OOC day).\n\nIf a dog has all its Vitality depleted, that particular ninken cannot be summoned for four weeks. The Tracking Fang Technique cannot be used if one or more of your dogs are recovering after such an event.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Mountain Dogs\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nThe Mountain Dogs (or wolves, as westerners know them), are always summoned in a pair. They appear as two giant wolves with grey coats and white undersides. While they're capable of speaking, they prefer not to, instead usually opting to growl their distaste. Unless the summoner is considerably more powerful than them, they'll assertively bully their own summoner around.\n\nThe wolves' shoulders reach the height of a single-story building's roof, and they're nearly thirty feet long from the nose to the tip of their tail.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nIf the summoner has less than 5000 XP, the Mountain Dogs will view them as a lower member of the pack and expect them to follow orders. At this level they won't be willing to do much beyond protect the summoner; if called on when the summoner isn't in genuine trouble or facing down another summoned animal, it's unlikely that they'll help at all.\n\nIf the summoner has 5000 to 6000 XP, the Mountain Dogs will view them as barely an equal. They'll look for reasons to bully the summoner around and nip at them in a show of dominance. They'll grudgingly speak from time to time, but will avoid doing so more than they have to. At this point the summoner is seen as a rival for dominance.\n\nAbove 6000 XP, the Mountain Dogs are subservient, acknowledging the summoner as the leader of their &quot;pack.&quot; They still won't be quite as agreeable as the ninken, and will expect to be treated reasonably well, but turnabout is fair play in terms of them being bossed around.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 2400\n\n<br> STR: 100\n<br> RES: 100\n<br> CHA: 100\n<br> DEX: 120\n<br> AGI: 100\n\n<br> Accuracy: 35\n<br> Dodge: +25\n<br> Damage Bonus: 6.6\n<br> Movement: 10 yards per IC.\n\n<br> Athletics: +20\n<br> Awareness: +25\n<br> Resistance: +20\n<br> Stealth: +30\n<br> Survival: +40\n<BR>\n\n\n###### Hamstring\nWhenever a mountain dog strikes someone with their Bite attack, that person's movement speed is reduced by 5% for the next 20 IC. This ability stacks with itself, up to a maximum of 10 times. All stacks of Hamstring expire 20 IC after the most recently applied one. For example, if you were hit by Hamstring 12 times, once every 10 IC, the last time being on IC 123, you wuold be at -50% movement speed until IC 143. This does not stack with immobilization; whichever provides the higher movement speed reduction overrides the other (though this has no bearing in immobilization's accuracy and dodge penalties).\n\n###### Large\nAnyone of human size attempting to maintain control of a grapple with the Mountain Dogs has a -10 penalty to their grapple rolls, and deals only half damage.\n\n###### Pack Tactics\nWolves excel at attacking as a group. Whenever anyone with the Pack Tactics ability acts on the same initiative count and makes a melee-range unarmed, any number of them may declare they are using Pack Tactics. When using Pack Tactics, the target uses the Speed of the slowest attack (that is, the one with the highest numerical Speed) to determine which interrupts their target can use, but must defend against each attack separately. The sum of the Speed of the defenses that the target wishes to use must be valid to use against that speed. For example, if both wolves attack with a Speed 10 Bite, the target's defenses cannot have a total Speed greater than (10/2) 5. They could dodge and parry, or dodge both, but two parries would be impossible (Speed 3*2 = 6).\n\n###### Pack Membership\nThe summoner of the Mountain Dogs gains the Pack Tactics ability as long as at least one of the wolves remains in battle.\n\n###### Strength of Many\nThe Mountain Dogs are able to fight more effectively alongside a worthy summoner. They add (the summoner's unarmed taijutsu Accuracy bonus)/5 to their own Accuracy; this does not include the base 10, and ignores Fatigue and status effects. Similarly, they add (the summoner's Dodge bonus)/5 to their own Dodge bonus, with the same rules.\n\n###### Tireless\nMountain Dogs do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when it act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +15 to their rolls.\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\nStandard Actions\nThe Mountain Dogs can use the Dodge, Move, and Block actions as described in Combat without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n###### Bite (Speed 10, AP 6)\nThe preferred attack for a canine is the bite and takedown, something they've been doing for millenia. Whereas a smaller dog would go for the legs, the mountains wolves have no need to do so. A bite is a basic unarmed attack inflicting 12d12 Blunt damage. If the attack hits by 5 points or more, it may automatically use its Takedown attack (see below).\n\n\n###### Intercept (Speed 20, 15 AP)\nWolves are already apex predators in their natural environments; the summoned versions adapt most of the techniques they would use for hunting prey when fighting their enemies. This may be used as an Interrupt against anyone who's spent 10 or more of the last 20 IC moving, with a range of (5)*(the number of IC the target spent moving in the past 20 IC) yards. The wolf lunges for them, attempting to simultaneously bite and tackle them. This deals 6d20 Blunt damage, receives only half the Mountain Dog's damage bonus, and is an automatic Surprise Attack. If it hits, it inflicts a Stun 12.\n\n###### Takedown (Speed +6, AP 4)\nAfter hitting with their bite attack by 5 points or more, the mountain dog may attempt to savage its victim and throw them to the ground. This requires an opposed grapple roll; if successful, the damage from Bite is increased by 25% and the target is knocked prone as if by the E-rank Trip taijutsu. Notably, this cannot be used against someone who's already prone.\n\n###### Track (Speed 20, AP 5)\nThe canine uses their superior senses, usually those of smell, to track down their quarry. This uses a survival roll with a +5 bonus to follow tracks towards a target. The difficulty of the check is based on the conditions. A standard non-ninja requires only a 15 to track. A shinobi normally requires a 20, but if they are trying to cover their tracks they get an opposed survival check, or a stealth check at -5. For each day old the track is the difficulty to track increases by +2. Rain or shifting ground conditions imposes a +5. Heavy rainfall, mudslides or tracking over running water imposes a +10. \n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe mountain dogs are feral wolves, and as such care nothing for the world of ninja. Instead, they care only about their own pack and territories. Generally speaking, they'll be only minimally inclined to assist a summoner unless that shinobi's wishes align with their own.\n\nThat said, if the summoner is in danger, they will generally rush to their pack's defense. However, if the summoner bit off far more than they could possibly handle, and should have (by the wolves' judgement) realized that ahead of time, odds are the wolves will let them get what they deserve. A member of the pack who is a detriment to its safety will simply be left to fend for themselves.\n\nFor other issues, it's a matter of needing a connection to pack or territory. Protecting prospective mates, hunting grounds, prey, or fellow 'pack members' (which is to say, allies) from assailants or outside interference are all completely acceptable reasons to call on the Mountain Dogs.\n\nOn the other hand, asking them to show up to kill a random bystander or an enemy who isn't worth their time, or to flaunt their power for the summoner's sake, will typically earn the summoner a bite for their insolence--and count as a Breach of Contract.</text>\n\n## Summon Avatar: Oguchi-no-Makami\n\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nOguchi-no-Makami, the &quot;True God of the Great Mouth&quot;, has a mythical status and is believed by some to be a force of nature, or an incarnation of nature itself. Stories can be found across the world of a giant wolf-spirit by that name guarding an ancient forest. Of course, none can agree about the size of guardian spirit, or which forest it's protecting, so most shinobi concur that it's nothing more than a legend.\n\nEven so, there's at least one very real being by that name. Oguchi is a giant white wolf, more than fifty feet tall at the shoulder and over a hundred feet long. Lending some credence to the story, it's able to maneuver forests (and cities, and similarly crowded areas) without disturbing a single leaf, despite its incredible size. While Oguchi is dwarfed by many of the other avatars in sheer size, it's still a powerful creature, one that should not be underestimated.\n\n  -  Chakra: 55\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nOguchi is fierce and powerful, bowing to no one. Its summoners are members of its pack asking for help, not entitled masters calling it into battle to serve them. Many summoners with this contract can report Oguchi simply ignoring their attempts to summon it; the common consensus is that he'll only appear when his &quot;pack&quot; is in danger.\n\n\\page\n\n<img \n  src='https://dncache-mauganscorp.netdna-ssl.com/thumbseg/1235/1235276-bigthumbnail.jpg' \n  style='width:325px' />\n  \nWhat exactly this constitutes is unclear, but summoning the Mountain Dogs into battle before it is likely to help. As with all wolves, Oguchi is quick to show dominance, and does not tolerate division among the pack. Oguchi is quick to quell any disagreements, and always ready to protect his (or is it her?) possessions.\n\nYes, possessions: Oguchi considers both the land and his pack to be its rightful property, and will fight savagely to protect them.</text>\n\n\n\\page\n## Feline Contract\n\nThe feline contract, to the chagrin of many a ninja, mainly involves cats--as in, housecats. Not nearly enough panthers, tigers, lions, and other great cats for most shinobi's tastes, and fewer still summonable cats capable of holding their own, let alone turning the tide, in battle between trained shinobi.\n\nIn terms of personality, they're significantly more helpful than their mundane counterparts. What they lack in useful supernatural abilities they make up for with a startling array of mundane talents. While they rarely make an appearance on the field of battle, shinobi with the contract will consistently describe their feline companions as being, if nothing else, 'useful'.\n\nThat is not to say that the feline species have no combat-worth specimens, just that the more powerful creatures who answer the contract's call will come only for similarly powerful shinobi. Their avatar, Byakko, is said to be feared even by the avatars of other contracts.\n\nFelines have an interesting relationship with the summoned canines. The two groups have quarreled frequently in the past, and it has without exception escalated into a horribly violent mess. As such, the two groups have established a truce: summoned felines and canines will never attack or directly act against one another. The avatars of those species, however, ignore this truce when it comes to their opposites; Byakko and Oguchi-no-Makami have no qualms about fighting each other.\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n###### 1000 XP: Summon: Ninja Cat\n###### 1400 XP: Feline Chef\n###### 1800 XP: Feline Merchant\n###### 2200 XP: Summon: Nekomata\n###### 2600 XP: Lucky Cat \n###### 3000 XP: Cat Burglar\n###### 4000 XP: Summon: Rakshasa\n###### 5000 XP: Summon: Byakko\n</text>\n\n## Techniques\n### --( Kuchiyose: Airuu - Summoning: Feline Chef )--\nBetween one and five felines, all the size of large housecats and capable of walking both on all fours on bipedally, appear in front of the summoning. All show up wearing a cooking apron, and one (the leader) will show up with a small chef's hat.\n\nThese cats are expert chefs, and capable of preparing excellent food literally anywhere. When summoned they'll promptly run off to forage for ingredients; how they can make a soup in the desert is a mystery, and just what's in the stew is probably best not to ask, but their meals are always nutritious and SO TASTY.\n\nSomehow they will always produce the supplies they need when people aren't looking (or even so much as blink), from metal pots to grills to firepits.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 \n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nThe feline chefs can be summoned up to three times a day (rather than once a week, as with most summons). The chef will cook a delicious meal for up to four people. However, the chefs absolutely do not take suggestions or requests, and if anyone tries telling them what to make they'll pack their things up and leave in a huff, not returning for a week.\n\nIt takes about half an hour for the cats to prepare the food; anyone who isn't there waiting when the meal is finished doesn't get anything to eat.\n\nOnce a month (every 4 weeks), the summoner can inform the chefs that it's a special occasion (the justification doesn't even need to be reasonable, as the chefs love the excuse to go all out). The meal will take a full hour to prepare, but will be a stunning gourmet feast. While the shinobi who partake in the meal will be well-fed, this also gives the head chef an excuse to experiment with dishes and seasonings in ways that may not sit well with the stomachs of their diners--not that they much care. After requesting a meal of this magnitude, one has no choice but to eat every last bite.\n\nWhen eating the gourmet meal, roll 1d6 twice; the frst roll determines the benefits, and the second the side-effects. The benefits all last for one day (in-character day, that is), as do the side effects unless their individual description specify otherwise.\n\n\n###### Well-Fed\n1) Brain Food: You have a +3 bonus to all skill rolls, as you feel charged and ready for anything.\n2) Complex Carbs: Your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls all have a +4 bonus.\n3) Protein Power: For the next 8 hours, you deal +10% taijutsu damage. \n4) Sugar Rush: You are wired, giving you a +2 bonus to Accuracy and defensive rolls.\n5) Surging Chakra: The 'secret ingredient' charged your energy reserves, and your ninjutsu deals 10% more damage.\n6) Great Meal: Your Fatigue penalties are treated as being one level lower until you reach Fatigue 3, at which point this benefit ends.\n\n###### Food Poisoning\n1) Double Vision: You suffer from a -2 visibility penalty for the next day; everything's a bit blurry.\n2) Upset Stomach: You have Paralysis 1 for the rest of the day as you wait for your stomach to recover.\n3) Woozy: You lose concentration for the next 2 hours, imposing a -3 penalty to Chakra Exhaustion rolls.\n4) Sweaty: You can't stop sweating, giving you a -3 penalty to all your Stamina rolls.\n5 - 6) No downsides! You lucked out.\n\n\nWhen still feeling the effects of one such gourmet meal, an individual will be too full to eat anything else.\n\\page\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Shounin Neko - Summoning: Feline Merchant )--\nThe feline summoned by this technique stands upright on its hind legs and is about two and a half feet tall. It carries a cylindrical wicker basket on its back, strapped around its waist and over its shoulders. Its waist strap doubles a belt, where it has several money pouches.\n\nOccasionally these cats will wear some sort of outfits, usually just consisting of a tunic and a shirt, though hats aren't entirely unheard of. Normally these will display a pawprint somewhere on them, prominently.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nThis summon has two tasks it can perform!\n\nThe first, it can be called upon to run general errands around a town or city. The cat will buy groceries and generally do any shopping you need, assuming you provide it with appropriate funds. It can also requisition items for you from ninja villages, before a mission! It can be summoned to do this once a day.\n\nThe second, it does a little bit of work as a merchant. You can 'sell' any requisitioned items to it for half their value, and 'buy' any items listed under &quot;Gear&quot; (which it produces from its wicker basket full of knick-knacks). For example, you could trade in two explosive tags (200), a katana (150), and a map of Wind Country (50); this would allow you to buy up to 200 ryo of items from the cat--a telescope, for example. This may be done once a week. Any more often than that and the cat will have nothing but useless junk available in its basket (some bits of string, a clawed-up piece of fabric, and so on).\n\nNotably, it cannot provide you with poison smoke bombs--while the smoke bombs themselves are in Gear, the necessary poisons are not.\n\nThe cat cannot be summoned in battle, and flees if attacked.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Maneki Neko - Summoning: Lucky Cat )--\nThis summons a ceramic figurine of a cat, standing about three or four inches tall. It's a calico bobtail sitting on its hindquarters, with one paw raised up in a beckoning gesture. These statues are said to bring good luck, and are often found (albeit on larger scale) at the entrance to shops and gambling halls.\n\nThis particular one actually does bring good luck to its bearer! Or, so the felines claim, and some of the few shinobi with this contract swear by its efficacy.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nWhenever you roll a 5 or lower on a d20, your Maneki Neko receives 1 Luck Counter. It may have up to three Luck Counters stored at a time.\n\nYou may spend a Luck Counter at any point to reroll any d20 roll you made, or replace an attack's Accuracy with an accuracy roll, keeping whichever of the results you prefer (typically the better one). This may be done at the same time you would normally spend Willpower.\n\nYou get no Luck Counters from rolls you rerolled this way. If you rolled a 3 on a dodge, and spent a Luck Counter to reroll it and got a 2, you would not receive a Luck Counter (and would still spend one normally). You may spend only one Luck Counter per roll.\n\nIf the figurine is lost or stolen, you may not use its effects; however, neither can whoever took it. Instead, whenever they roll a 15 or higher on a d20 they must reroll until they get a result below 15. Getting rid of, or even breaking, the figurine won't do them any good--as soon as they look away, it reappears in their possession, until the technique would expire normally.\n\nThis remains around for a full day, or the duration of a fight (if summoned during, or immediately before, combat) or mission. You may summon this figurine once every four weeks.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Akisu - Summoning: Cat Burglar )--\nYet another bipedal cat, the Akisu is dressed in a black turtleneck, beanie, and domino mask. The cat burglar requires payment up-front in catnip, and once it's received its compensation the summoner names their mark. After a moment of preparation the cat burglar gets to work, and in hardly any time at all the summoner will receive a 'brand new' item.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nThe cat moves unerringly towards its target, at the rate of 4 yards per IC. Even if the target hides or moves outside of the initial range, nothing will stop the cat, which flawlessly dodges all attacks and crosses difficult terrain with ease! Well, almost nothing. It won't cross areas with an Immobilization penalty of -8 or higher, and if it's in a damaging area-of-effect technique with an Area of 30 or higher it will be blown comically out of the blast radius before vanishing in a puff of smoke. Though you must be able to see the target when you summon the cat burglar, it willt hen be able to find them on their own no matter what tricks they use; it will break the Stealth of someone who hides from it, and clones created after the cat was summoned will be unable to confuse it.\n\\page\n\nUpon its arrival, the cat scampers up the victim and begins searching their possessions! When this happens, roll 1d4. On a roll of 1-3, the user selects one item the target has; on a roll of 4, the target makes things difficult for the cat, resulting in it grabbing something less valuable (meaning, the target chooses the item).\n\nThe cat takes all items of that type; for example, all Maps, or all Katanas. The only exception is that it cannot disarm its target. If used against someone with Full Pockets, they cannot use their unique to produce any more items of the stolen type until they have an opportunity to resupply. The cat will even steal items inside Storage Scrolls! It's a very, very good burglar, after all.\n\nIt then returns to its summoner, following the same movement rules, though this time an attack which manages to catch the cat in its area results in the cat, after flying through the air yowling, hitting the ground at its summoner's feet before vanishing. Upon arriving at its summoner (one way or another), said summoner can take any items they wish as a Speed X action, with X being the number of items, but having a minimum of 5 (AP cannot reduce this action's Speed). Any excess items are dropped on the ground.\n\nA cat carrying more than 10 items drops one every 8 yards it travels.\n\n\nOut of combat, the cat can be instructed to steal either from a person or location, though needs fairly specific instructions (the guard's keys, that painting, and so on).</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Ninja Cat\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nA two- to three-foot-tall bipedal cat, much like the merchant and chef cats summoned by this same contract. This one appears wearing simple ninja attire, including a headband or bandana; they even wear forehead protectors, with a feline pawprint in place of a village insignia.\n\nAs the summoner trains and becomes a better ninja, so will 'their' ninja cat! Over time the cat will expand its arsenal, wearing handguards and a vest, along with holsters for shuriken and the like.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nYes, there really are cat ninjas. They all have impressive credentials, such as being masters of neko-ken (&quot;cat fist&quot;) style martial arts. While their efficacy in battle leaves much to be desired, they do have the advantage of occasionally debilitating opponents with laughter.\n\nA visual aid, for those having trouble picturing a ninja cat:\nhttp://i43.tinypic.com/5ehe1x.png\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nEach summoner calls upon their own shinobi cat, who will be a faithful companion in times of need. While handseals are out of the question, these cats train diligently to master the shinobi arts in their off-time!\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitaity: 400\n<br> STR: 40\n<br> RES: 50\n<br> CHA: 40\n<br> DEX: 60\n<br> AGI: 80\n\n<br> Accuracy: 15\n<br> Dodge: +6\n<br> Damage Bonus: 2.0\n<br> Movement: 3 yards per IC\n\n<br> Athletics: +10\n<br> Awareness: +5\n<br> Espionage: +5\n<br> Stealth: +10\n<br> Survival: +5\n<BR>\n\n###### Devoted\nYour cat trains (sort of) hard to remain a valuable ally in combat! As your XP increases, so does its performance. The bonus movement speed is calculated to one decimal point (as is its increased damage bonus, as usual). The bonus to skill rolls only applies to skills the cat already has.\n  Accuracy, Dodge, Parry: (XP/200)\n  Damage Bonus: (XP/500)\n  Skill Rolls: (XP/250)\n  Movement Speed: +(XP/1000) yards per IC\n  Vitality: (XP/100)*10\n\n\n###### Independent\nYour ninja cat can act on its own. It does not require you to spend AP for it to take actions unless the action itself specifies that it does.\n\n\n###### Small\nIf hit by an area-of-effect technique, the cat takes only half damage. However, it is blown clear of the area (usually in an over-the-top, and likely comedic, fashion), and suffers a knockback equal to the attack's Area.\n\n\n###### Ninja Training\nShinobi cats train tirelessly in the ninja arts, up to two hours a day! They'll work just hard enough to keep up with their summoner; any more would simply be an unreasonable amount of effort. For every 500 XP, pick one of the following improvements. You may not select any of them more than once.\n\n   Armor: Your cat appears in appropriate ninja-armor, such as handguards, a padded vest, and so forth. Whenever it would take more than 25% of its maximum Vitality in damage from an attack, that attack's damage is divided by 4.\n\n   Neko-ken: Your cat has mastered martial arts! This gives it a +4 bonus to any unarmed parries, and improves its Cat Paw Strike action.\n\n   Ninja Combatant: Your cat shows up with smoke and flash bombs! It has (XP/750) of each, to a maximum of 5.\n\n   Ninjutsu: Yes. It can perform ninjutsu, somehow. Despite the cats referring to these as &quot;nyanton&quot; techniques, they are actually perfectly ordinary jutsu. The jutsu usable are explained below. The cat can use 4+(XP/2000) ninjutsu per battle.\n\n   Quick: Your cat is fast! It adds (XP/1000) to its Accuracy, along with its dodge and parry rolls, to a maximum of +4.\n\n   Saboteur: Your cat shows up with a grappling hook, rope, set of cat-sized lockpicks (with a +2 bonus, if it matters) and (XP/1500) type 2 exploding tags.\n\n   Shuriken: Your cat now shows up with holsters for shuriken! This unlocks the &quot;shuriken throw&quot; ability below. Your cat carries (XP/100) shuriken into battle with it.\n\n   Sword: It's more of a knife, really, considering their size. But to them, it's a sword! Katanas are common, though some will use combat knives or straight-bladed swords. This unlocks the &quot;sword attack&quot; ability below.\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nNinja cats can use the dodge, parry, move, block, and hide actions, as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB.\n\n###### Agility (Speed 0, 5 AP)\nThis ability can be activated at any time, including after the cat is attacked but before its defense has been declared. It ends any immobilization penalties it's suffering from, and makes it immune to that source (a specific instance of a jutsu, for example) from then on. This does not apply to 'internal' penalties--ones caused by poison, for example.\n\n###### Cat Paw Strike (Speed 10)\nYour cat punches, kicks, or occasionally claws, someone! This is a basic unarmed taijutsu attack dealing 2d6 Blunt or Slashing damage. If your cat has the Neko-ken attribute, this is reduced to Speed 6 and adds a Stun 2, and its damage is raised to 4d8. Its damage bonus is multiplied by 10, rather than 6, even at this lower Speed.\n\n###### Nyanjutsu (Speed Variable)\nThe cat can perform various ninjutsu techniques after it has the &quot;ninjutsu&quot; attribute. They are as follows:\n   Kawarimi (Speed +2): This is declared after the cat is hit by a technique and partial defense applies; its dodge is increased to speed 4 (and must remain a valid interrupt for this to be used), and the cat dodges entirely, having left behind a wooden figurine of a cat with its tongue stuck out in its place.\n   Bunshin (Speed 6): The cat creates three clones, which follow the normal rules in the E-rank Bunshin ninjutsu, with the following exceptions. The cat is always hidden amongst the clones, as each clone is capable of attacking, though only one may act at a time.\n   Henge (Speed 5): The cat may turn into any object of approximately the same size, following the normal rules for the E-rank Henge jutsu.\n   Genjutsu Kai (Speed 10): The cat may use this on itself or its summoner.\n   Shunshin no Jutsu (Speed 2): The cat may perform this as if it had (XP/200) AP, a maximum of once every 20 IC.\n   Utsusemi (Speed 0): The cat can use this, for all the good it does.\n\n\n###### Shuriken Throw (Speed 4 + X)\nYour cat throws up to X shuriken. It may target up to X/4 people with this attack (dealing full damage), receives +X/5 Accuracy, and increases its damage bonus by X*0.2. X has a maximum of (XP/250). Cats cannot use normal shuriken, only special shuriken crafted to be usable by creatures without opposable thumbs (which they acquire via the &quot;Shuriken&quot; attribute).\n\n###### Sword Attack (Speed 12)\nYour cat attacks with its sword! This does require the &quot;Sword&quot; attribute. This weapon deals 8d10 Slashing damage, and follows normal rules for weapon attacks. Additionally, it has a +3 bonus when being used to parry other weapons.\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nOne of the rare exceptions to the rule that summons of the same contract will not work against one another, two ninja cats, if summoned by enemies in a battle, will fight one another!</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Nekomata\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nLegend says that once a cat has lived long enough its tail will split in two and a nekomata will be born. Whether or not that's the origin of these creatures is hard to say, but doubtful.\n\nNekomata are slightly bigger than a very large housecat, and have the features and coloration of any ordinary breed of cat, though grey and black are the most common colors. They all posssess a pair of long, sinuous tails, and commonly walk on air at face level. When not actively moving about they tend to lounge on people's shoulders or heads, often in the most awkward or uncomfortable way possible for the recipient.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 18\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nNekomata are happy to assist in confusing and tormenting the summoner's enemies. They're capable of deploying mirages and illusions with skill rivaling most shinobi, taunting and frustrating their victims. That said, they're much more cat-like than some of the contract's other animals, and will typically refuse to perform menial tasks. Nekomata are highly intelligent and can understand human languages, though cannot speak them.\n\nIf asked to engage in direct combat the cat will do so reluctantly, and fight to the best of its ability. However, the summoner runs the risk of it getting bored and leaving without any warning.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 800\n<br> STR: 20\n<br> RES: 40\n<br> CHA: 100\n<br> DEX: 60\n<br> AGI: 80\n\n<br> Accuracy: 32\n<br> Dodge: +24\n<br> Genjutsu: +18\n<br> Damage Bonus: 4.0\n<br> Movement: 2 yard per IC\n\n<br> Athletics: +10\n<br> Awareness: +15\n<br> Resistance: +10\n<br> Stealth: +20\n\n<br> Chakra Exhaustion: +12\n<BR>\n\n###### Levitate\nThe Nekomata is capable of floating, and spends most of its time walking or sitting on empty air. It ignores any effects associated with the condition of the ground, or requiring it to be in contact with it.\n\n###### Small\nThe Nekomata is the size of a very large housecat. It takes half damage of area-of-effect attacks, but any knockbacks its suffers are doubled.\n\n###### Trickster\nBy raising their Chakra cost by 10, the Nekomata can replace its genjutsu roll with 1d20, and the defender's roll with 1d20+4; this is declared when an appropriate ability is being used. Uniques, abilities, and doujutsu do not provide their normal benefits. The Iron Curtain technique still works, and similarly the Nekomata receives any bonuses specific to individual abilities it uses. Additionally, the Nekomata itself is immune to any targeted genjutsu.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Cremation (Chakra 16, Speed 6, 4 AP)\nThis applies an Ignite 1 to everyone present in battle, as pale blue, ghostly flames briefly flicker over them.\n\n\n###### Spirit Flame (Chakra 10 * X, Speed 14)\nThe nekomata creates Xd4 wisps of hovering blue fire. You may pay 2 AP to have the Nekomata launch one of these at a target, using its normal Accuracy +3. After somebody's been hit by Spirit Fire, they can't be targeted by it again until at least 5 IC have passed.\n\nAnyone struck by a Spirit Flame suffers Ignite 5 and Burns 3. Both those statuses will stack with multiple uses of Spirit Fire, increasing the victim's current severity (from this source) appropriately. By raising the cost to attack with a flame to 5 AP, you may use your Accuracy in place of the Nekomata's; you may do this no more than once every 10 IC.\n\n\\page\n\n###### Phantasmal Flames (Chakra 16, Speed 10, 8 AP)\nThis multiplies the number of Spirit Flames present by 1d4. Any 'extras' created this way are just illulsions. For example, if there were 3 Spirit Flames, and you rolled a 3 on Illusionary Flames, you would wind up with 3 real flames, and 6 illusions, for (3*3) 9 total. If you use this ability again, it replaces (rather than adds to) any currently-existing phantasmal flames.\n\nWhenever you attack with a Spirit Flame, after it's determined if your attack would have hit (and your opponent has used, and paid for, their defense appropriately), roll 1dX, with X being the total number of flames. If it's in the lower (number of real flames), a real flame hits--if not, the attack was an illusion. You do not pay the AP cost to attack with a spirit flame, and the illusion is destroyed.\n\nIn the above example, you would roll 1d9. On a roll of 1-3, an actual Spirit Flame would have been launched. On a roll of 4 - 9, it would be an illusion.\n\n\n###### Mirage (Chakra 25)\nThe Nekomata may perform the Double False Surroundings technique (C-rank genjutsu), with an additional +5 bonus to its genjutsu roll. The Nekomata does not need to pay the Upkeep for it, though it ends if the Nekomata is unsummoned. This may only be used out of combat.\n\nWhenever it uses this ability, there is a 25% chance that it will, rather than accompanying the summoner, choose to lounge nearby and watch its illusion for the next 2d8 hours before unsummoning itself. If the illusion is dispelled before then, the Nekomata will still unsummon itself, but the summoner will somehow, intuitively know that someone removed the illusion.\n\n\n###### Illusion of Death (Chakra 16, Speed 10, 8 AP)\nAn illusion which causes the victim to suffer from, essentially, a dangerously overactive imagination. Whenever faced with an impending attack, they briefly imagine fatal or otherwise crippling outcomes: senbon piercing their trachea, a sword cutting their head clean off, a fireball leaving them a charred corpse, and so forth. This applies a Stun 4 whenever they take a defensive Interrupt action. This follows all normal rules for genjutsu.\n\n\n###### Displace (Chakra 15, Speed 4, 4 AP)\nRather than actually avoiding an attack, the Nekomata confounds its assailant with a clever illusion. This may be used as a defensive interrupt, in place of a dodge. The Nekomata makes a genjutsu roll against its attacker; if it succeeds, it dodges the attack. If it succeeds by 10 or more, it may then specify a new target within the attacker's range (including how far they can move as part of their attack), and redirect the attack at them. Someone defending against this technique does not receive the normal cumulative bonus to genjutsu rolls from being affected by a technique repeatedly.\n\n\n###### Vanish (Chakra 20, Speed 10, 6 AP)\nThe Nekomata makes a Genjutsu roll with a +10 bonus. Anyone who fails their defensive genjutsu roll loses sight of it; it immediately becomes invisible, enters Stealth 3, and moves up to (the result of its Genjutsu roll) yards in any direction.\n\nThe movement occurs even if its genjutsu roll failed. To anyone who passed their roll, or later finds it, the Nekomata is fully visible; to anyone else, it remains invisible. The &quot;Point Out&quot; action has no effect when used against a Nekomata hidden this way. If it uses Spirit Flames or Cremation it will immediately exit stealth; however, attacking with an already-created Spirit Flame only reduces its Stealth TN by 4.\n\nAs with an ordinary genjutsu, victims receive a cumulative bonus to defend against this technique for each time they've been affected by it in combat. Unlike normal genjutsu, this effect doesn't end if the people who the Nekomata is hidden from are wounded.\n\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nOf the animals summoned by the feline contract, nekomata are the closest to 'normal' cats in terms of behavior. They're fickle, lazy, easily distracted, and prone to randomly becoming bored. Any time it uses one of its abilities (other than Mirage, which has its own rules) there's a 5% chance that it will lose interest and unsummon itself.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Rakshasa\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nDespite appearing in many myths, it's unclear what exactly rakshasa are; descriptions of their appearances and behavior are wildly inconsistent, from giant black tigers with vicious fangs and claws, to cannibals with flaming eyes and hair, to cruel spirits in human form. Of course, it's also possible that several of those depictions are true, as rakshasa are also rumored to be capable of changing their form as easily as a human would change clothes.\n\nWhen called upon by shinobi, however, they tend to follow a consistent appearance, that of a tall man (even 'female' rakshasa apparently take on masculine bodies) with the head of a tiger, retractable claws at the ends of their fingers, and orange-and-black fur across their bodies. Most are dressed in robes, typically red and gold in coloration. Some look noble, others feral and violent.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nA rakshasa's behavior and demeanor varies as wildly as their appearance, and so there's no way of knowing whether the creature summoned genuinely intends to assist the summoner to the best of their ability, or is only helping them for the opportunity to sabotage their goals later on. As such, summoning a Rakshasa is a calculated risk in most circumstances.\n\nAll Rakshasa can speak any human language (and some of unclear origin) flawlessly and without accent; while some sound refined and others harsh and guttural, these seem to be personal affectations on the parts of the rakshasa themselves.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 2000\n\n<br> STR: 100\n<br> RES: 110\n<br> CHA: 140\n<br> DEX: 120\n<br> AGI: 130\n\n<br> Accuracy: 48\n<br> Dodge: +32\n<br> Genjutsu: +46\n\n<br> Stamina: +15\n<br> Chakra Exhaustion: +25\n\n<br> Damage Bonus: 12.0\n<br> Movement: 2.6 yards per IC\n\n<br> Athletics: +30\n<br> Awareness: +35\n<br> Chakra Control: +35\n<br> Espionage: +35\n<br> Research: +20\n<br> Stealth: +35\n<br> Survival: +35\n<BR>\n\n\n###### Dark Mind\nThough a Rakshasa's mind is not too different from a human's to affect with genjutsu, doing so can be risky. Attempting to influence its mind risks the person doing so suffering a painful feedback through their chakra, typically in the form of a sudden wave of horror. If a Rakshasa is targeted by a genjutsu and rolls an 11 or above on its defensive genjutsu roll, the person who targeted it automatically loses 1 Willpower. If they have no Willpower remaining, they instead suffer a Stun 10.\n\n###### Spirit Siphon\nUnlike most summons, the Rakshasa may spend Willpower--or, more specifically, its owner's. This can be done any time Willpower would normally be spent, with the usual effects. If the Rakshasa betrays its summoner (see Treachery, below) in combat, it will always use Spirit Siphon on the attack made against them.\n\n###### Treachery\nUnlike most summons, Rakshasa will sometimes turn against the ninja who called upon them--but there's no way of knowing that one is planning to do so until it's too late. Every time the Rakshasa is given a task, or acts in combat, there is a 10% chance that it will somehow turn against the summoner. This could mean informing people who it was sent to spy on that the summoner is nearby, or sabotaging the path it was sent to scout; in combat, this check is made whenever it attacks. If the 10% chance takes place, it instead attacks the summoner with the same technique. After the Rakshasa betrays their summoner this way, it will disappear (often cackling evilly as it does so); after five checks have been made without betraying the summoner, that particular Rakshasa will not do so for the remainder of the time it's summoned. Additionally, Rakshasa will not betray summoners with 6000 or more XP.\n\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Banishment (Speed 6, Chakra 30, 4 AP)\nThis technique can be used in response to any attack which targets the Rakshasa, including area-of-effect techniques whose radius it's in. The Rakshasa traces a mandala in mid-air, the symbols etching themselves in ghostly flames, and the offending objects are removed.\nUsed against ninjutsu, the technique disappears completely, as if it had never been used (though any costs are still paid). Against weapon taijutsu, the weapons vanish; unique weapons (ones not from the Equipment section of the PHB) reappear 2d100 yards away from the Rakshasa, in the opposite direction from the attacker. Melee attackers instead reappear 2d20 yards in a direction of the Rakshasa's choosing.\n\n###### Burning Chains (Speed 12, Chakra 40, 8 AP)\nThe Rakshasa levels a gaze at a target and speaks in an incomprehensible language; the flames around that person lift themselves off the individual's body and form chains of dark red fire and burnt iron, anchoring the unfortunate soul to the ground. This can only target someone suffering from Ignite, and cannot be defended against, though the Rakshasa must be able to see the target, and it has a range of 50.\nAll Ignites on the target are suspended, and instead converted into Immobilization penalties; Ignite 8 would become -8 Immobilize. The &quot;Ignite&quot; continues to decay at its normal rate, but effects which remove or reduce Ignite don't work (since it's an Immobilize, not an Ignite). Removing the Immobilize penalty from Burning Chains causes the Rakshasa's Upkeep to end, and the Ignite to return.\nIf the Rakshasa betrays its summoner when ordered to use Burning Chains, it first transfers all Ignites from the target to the summoner, and then uses Burning Chains.\n\n###### Immolate (Speed 16, Chakra 50, 10 AP)\nWith a single gesture, the Rakshasa lights its victim ablaze. This applies an automatic Ignite 10; it cannot be blocked, parried, or stopped with ninjutsu-based defenses (such as Ocean Shield). It can be dodged, though doing so is done at a -10 penalty. If used against summons, this deals damage as a percent of their maximum Vitality (as if it was damaging HP under normal Ignite rules), rather than current, and is reduced at half the normal speed (RES/40 rather than RES/20). Immolate has a range of 40 yards, or 80 yards if used against a summoned creature.\n\n###### Rake (Speed 12, Stamina 15, 2 AP)\nThe Rakshasa slashes someone with its claws. This deals 12d20 Slashing damage, ignores armor, and inflicts a Bleed 8 status.\n\n###### Shadow Step (Speed +4, +Delay 8, +6 AP)\nThe Rakshasa takes a step forward, then dissolves into wisps of pitch black smoke and the smell of charcoal; moments later it reappears with the same show of smoke, striking from its own personal darkness. This augments one of the Rakshasa's melee attacks (Rake or Soul Rot), and modifies its parameters accordingly. Between the time the action is used and when the Delay ends, the Rakshasa cannot be targeted; after the Delay, it reappears on the battle field, in range of whoever its target is.\nWhen a Shadow Step attack is used, the Rakshasa does not need to specify its target. When the Delay ends, it appears behind its target; this can target anyone who within 200 yards and not in Stealth when Shadow Step was used. Entering Stealth, creating clones, or moving away during the Delay will not prevent the Rakshasa from finding its mark.\nWhen Shadow Step is declared, the Rakshasa can either sacrifice 10% of its maximum Vitality for a +4 bonus to Accuracy, or 20% for a +8 bonus.\n\n###### Soul Rot (Speed 18, Chakra 40, 15 AP)\nThe Rakshasa makes a melee strike against a victim, but rather than dealing a vicious blow lightly rakes its claws across them--and in doing so, bestows a potent curse upon them. The unfortunate recipient will begin experiencing a horrid pain across their body--and, more pressingly, start dying rapidly. Every IC that passes, they lose 20 HP. This persists until the Rakshasa is unsummoned, the victim falls below 0 HP, or the Rakshasa's summoner orders the creature to end the effect. If a Rakshasa uses this on the summoner after betraying them, the effect instead persists until the summoner's HP falls below 0 or a Contract Seal is applied to them.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon Avatar: Byakko\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nA mythical creature, Byakko is said to be the guardian of the west, and the symbolic representation of autumn, righteousness, and iron. The actual, physical Byakko is also a white tiger large enough to crush houses under a single paw, possessing a roar that can flatten trees and a ferocious gaze that can send all but the mightiest opponents fleeing in terror.\n\n  -  Chakra: 60\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nByakko is the Lord of Beasts, the apex predator of the land. In his eyes, he is the almighty emperor of the world; all other animals, and even shinobi, are his subjects. He is a stern, but magnanimous ruler, free of contempt, scruelty, or scorn for his 'subjects'--his lordship of them is only natural, in light of his all-eclipsing power.\n\nEven other summoned avatars are viewed not as equals by Byakko, but rather as challenging prey.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summoning Contract: Hare\nHares (including rabbits, but really, what ninja knows the difference?) are the least adept in battle of all the major species of summoned animals. Much like their wild counterparts they are not predatory and have no natural defenses beyond their ability to flee (which they are, to be fair, quite good at).\n\nThat alone ensures that most ninja do not consider the rabbits worth the time and effort involved in fostering good relations with them. Still, some go to the trouble of doing so.\n\nHares are kind-hearted creatures, but not weak-willed. They will not tolerate a master who takes delight in causing others suffering, or who is unwilling to attempt to resolve issues peacefully. Similarly, when confronting enemies who they view as genuinely evil, the few combat-capable summoned rabbits display a shocking degree of remorselessness.\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n<br> 800 XP: A Small Rabit\n<br> 1200 XP: Diplomatic Immunity\n<br> 1600 XP: Summon: Jade Rabbit\n<br> 2000 XP: Hare of Inaba\n<br> 2400 XP: Summon: Yojimbo\n<br> 3000 XP: Sanctuary\n<br> 4000 XP: Summon: Satsu no Usagi\n<br> 4500 XP: Summon: Tsuki no Usagi</text>\n<BR>\n\n## Techniques\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Chiisana Usagi - Summoning: A Small Rabbit )--\nIt does exactly what it says: summons a small rabbit. These are remarkably docile and friendly creatures, and an exception to the standard that summoned animals won't simply wait around at their summoner's leisure.\n\nThe rabbit cannot talk, and lacks any obvious supernatural talents. It likes carrots and lettuce, and will allow itself to be carried around and petted at the summoner's leisure.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X/2\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nIf anyone attempts to attack the rabbit or its summoner it flees immediately, leaping away before disappearing in a puff of smoke.\n\nHowever, whenever there is someone hidden within 10+X yards who the summoner doesn't know about, the rabbit will tense up begin shaking, going very still as its ears perk up.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Gaikou Tokken - Diplomatic Immunity )--\nAttempting to negotiate as a ninja is a risky prospect, because as often as not the people you try to talk to really don't care that you have a white flag, and would rather jump and murder you than listen to you explaining why violence really isn't necessary.\n\nThis technique creates a wooden pendant, a circle with three carved hares inside it forming a triskelion of sorts, which can only be worn by the summoner (and, if not put on within a minute, crumbles to dust). So long as it's worn, they have significant protections against hostility, though in exchange must live up to their own set of standards.\n\nThe pendant's design looks something like so:\nhttp://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/images/Tinners2.gif\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 60\n\nEffects:\nAnyone attacking, hindering, or taking other hostile actions against you has a -15 penalty to any associated Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and a -5 penalty to their Accuracy and other offensive rolls against you. Additionally, during this technique's duration you gain 100 DR.\n\nHowever, you cannot attack anyone who hasn't attacked you first or take other hostile actions that aren't in self-defense. You may not hide (via Stealth) unless it's during battle. You cannot enter any buildings, camps, or other guarded areas without first making your presence known to the owners, occupants, or guards (as appropriate) and receiving their permission.\n\nIf you break the restrictions of this technique, the wooden pendant shatters and its effects end immediately. When this occurs you automatically advance two Fatigue levels; this increase in Fatigue cannot be avoided.\n\nYou can also take the pendant off, in which case it simply crumbles to dust. The pendant must be worn obviously; you cannot tuck it into a shirt or otherwise deliberately hide it. If you do so, or if you attempt to actively goad people into attacking you (to inflict its penalties on them before you retaliate), it breaks. The pendant will not last longer than 6 hours.\n\\page\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Inaba no Usagi - Hare of Inaba )--\nAccording to legends, the goddess Amaterasu was once wandering the land looking for a place to rest for the night. As the story goes, she was approached by a rabbit which took her to the town of Inaba, and for its kindness she gave it her blessings.\n\nIt's rather hard to believe that the story's true, the rabbit was real, and it's still alive and available to be summoned--it's more likely that 'Hare of Inaba' is the collective term given to these large (for rabbits) white rabbits, though more supersticious people are hesitant to harm them all the same, as the myth claims anyone who does so will incur the sun goddess' wrath.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nThis summons a white rabbit which cannot speak. When it's called, the summoner asks it to guide them to a location of their choosing. This may be a place the summoner is familiar with, or a descriptive (rather than specific) location; &quot;The other side of this mountain range&quot; or &quot;The nearest town&quot; would both be acceptable, but &quot;The enemy camp,&quot; or &quot;The nearest group of shinobi hiding from us&quot; would not. In short, it could not be used to find a person or group that doesn't want to be found or whose existence the summoner isn't aware of.\n\nHowever, it will then flawlessly lead the summoner and anyone with them, at a pace equivalent to a brisk walk (or slower, if necessary), to the chosen location so long as it's within a week's travel. It will lead them around all ambushes, traps, snares, hidden enemies, and so on. If it reaches a point where this is impossible (there is only a single bridge crossing a river and there are explosives planted on it, or enemies waiting to attack on the other side) it will stop and sit there, shaking, until either the threat is dealt with or it's carried through the 'danger zone' by its summoner.\n\nIf the rabbit is attacked, it flees instantly, though there may be more to this story of a 'curse' befalling those who attempt to injure it than most shinobi believe. However, attempting to use the rabbit as a 'shield' of sorts (summoning it in battle as a deterrent to someone attacking you or the area near you) is a Breach of Contract.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n###  --( Seiiki - Sanctuary )--\nFollowing the hare's ideals of nonviolent resolution of conflicts, this technique facilitates peaceful negotiations by ensuring that those who attempt to use diplomacy as a cover to ambush or attack their enemies are punished for doing so. How the technique works at all puzzles shinobi, as it doesn't have similarities to any known sort of jutsu.\n\nAfter the technique is completed, the entire affected area somehow seems lighter and more peaceful. Anyone inside its boundaries instinctively knows that hostility is not welcome, and has a marked aversion to any such actions.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25 + X\n  -  Range: 0\n  -  Area: 100 + X*2\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Seal Speed: 80\n\nEffects:\nTaking any sort of offensive action within the area is prohibited, as is deliberately launching attacks into it. Offensive actions include all attacks and targeted genjutsu, whether or not they deal damage. Setting explosives and modifying the terrain for combat (for example, the A-rank Yomi Numa, or Katon explosive clouds) are offensive actions.\n\nBreaking this rule carries a harsh penalty: Anyone who does so has a -10 penalty to all their offensive actions, including Accuracy, genjutsu, Stealth and Awareness rolls, Toxicology and Chakra Control rolls to inflict status effects, and parry rolls made as part of 'counter-attack' moves (such as Halting Blow). This lasts for as long as they're in the sanctuary field, and one hour afterwards.\n\nOnce a person has violated the sanctuary's restrictions, they can be attacked and otherwise subjected to offensive actions with impunity; anyone attacking them is not breaking the rules of the sanctuary. Anybody who aids them, however, such as taking a hit for them or giving them supplies mid-battle, is similarly affected if they do so within the field.\n\nThis lasts X/4 hours, to a maximum of 12. The summoner may not choose to end it early, and is subject to the same restrictions and penalties as anyone else.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Jade Rabbit\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Speed: 8 \n  -  Seal Speed: 12\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\nSaid to be the rabbit who lives under the moon, it only comes out at night. One of the caste of direct minions of the avatar, he is the moonlight to the avatar's moon in actuality. You should not summon the Jade Rabbit during the day, it is too busy sleeping and if you do it has dire consequences (Read below). It actually floats around and can help you find anything touched by the moonlight. It will not attack unless it is attacked first.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n<br> Vitality: 650\n<br> STR: 20\n<br> RES: 40\n<br> CHA: 100\n<br> DEX: 60\n<br> AGI: 80\n\n<br> Accuracy: 30\n<br> Dodge: +22\n<br> Genjutsu: +14\n<br> Damage Bonus: 3.0\n<br> Movement: 3 yard per IC, Floating\n\n<br> Athletics: +15\n<br> Awareness: +18\n<br> Resistance: +10\n<br> Stealth: +5\n\n<br> Chakra Exhaustion: +14\n<BR>\n\n###### Shining Light\nWhile under the moonlight the rabbit emits a bright light, this shines out for 20 yards and anyone in stealth is revealed, but while this light shines you cannot stealth either.\n\n###### Elusive Target\nThe rabbit is small and has the luck of the moon! It has access to the Ninjutsu, Kawarimi. It also takes no damage from AoE attacks where it isn't the sole target.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n######    Standard Actions\nThe Jade Rabbit may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. \n\n######    Blinding Flash (Speed 10, AP 12)\nThe Jade Rabbit is a beacon of hope but also one of light! This technique uses the C-rank Raiton Taiyoken\n\n<Br>\n\n######    Bite (Speed 8, 4 AP)\nNot an amazing combatant, the Jade Rabbit usually gets out of dangerous situations using it's teeth. A bite inflicts 4d6 piercing damage and is considered a basic unarmed attack. The Jade Rabbit bite is far more painful than it is actually damaging and if used in a grapple, it gets a +10 to the check to escape the grapple.\n\n######    Burning Brilliance (Special) \nIf you do, in fact, summon the rabbit during the day, it appears in a spot 1d12 Yards away from you in a random direction (Chosen by rolling a D8 and north, north-east, etc). Once it appears there it bursts into flames and suddenly combusts, unsummoning itself in a burst of fiery flames, the blast counting as a C-rank Katon that does 8d20 damage in an 8 yard AoE centered on the Rabbit. The Rabbits damage bonus is trippled and if it hits the user, it deals double damage.\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe Jade Rabbits are a straightforward bunch and will stick around with you as long as you need their light and as long as it's not day time! If you do summon one during the day it will stay for the duration of one combat and then not be summonable for 30 Days OOC.\n\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Yojimbo\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nLiterally meaning 'bodyguard', the yojimbo is just that. It's a three foot tall bipedal white rabbit wearing a blue haori, black hakama, and straw sandals, with its ears tied together by white cloth an an imitation of a topknot. Yojimbo hares each carry a single katana. They have hands, rather than forepaws, complete with opposable thumbs.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15 + X * 10\n  -  Speed:\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nYou summon X Yojimbo, up to a maximum of 3.\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\nTrained as unified bodyguards, the caste of Yojimbo are the warriors who protect the lesser rabbits. They are trained in martial skills and despite their size can pack quite a punch. They each wear swords and will fight for you though will not attack the innocent.\n\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n<br> Vitality: 850\n<br> STR: 30\n<br> RES: 50\n<br> CHA: 60\n<br> DEX: 80\n<br> AGI: 70\n\n<br> Accuracy: 32\n<br> Dodge: +18\n<br> Parry: +26\n<br> Genjutsu: +10\n<br> Damage Bonus: 3.0\n<br> Movement: 3 yard per IC, Floating\n\n<br> Athletics: +15\n<br> Awareness: +12\n<br> Resistance: +15\n<br> Stealth: +10\n\n<br> Chakra Exhaustion: +12\n<BR>\n\n###### Compatriots\nFor every Yojimbo after the first present on the battlefield, all the others receive +3 Accuracy, an additional +2 to parries, +2 to Take the Hit, +1 to their damage bonus, and -1 to their AP costs. This stacks up to five times (when there are six Yojimbo present).\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n######    Standard Actions\nYojimbo may use Dodge, Move, Parry, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. \n\n######    Iajutsu Strike (Speed 10, AP 15)\nThe Yojimbo can make a quick strike as their first unsheathing, it gains an additional +3 Accuracy\n\n###### Defensive Formation (Speed Variable)\nProtecting a target is their bread and butter, well-trained Yojimbo keep their targets alive, it is their honor and their life. While there are two or more Yojimbo present, they can use the ability Defensive Formation, Total Defense, and Guard, as detailed in the Physical Abilities\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\n   Breach of Contract:\n&gt; Killing an enemy who surrendered or has been rendered incapable of causing harm (i.e. unconscious or otherwise incapacitated).\n&gt; Threatening or killing hostages or innocent bystanders.\n&gt; Initiating combat.\n&gt; Pursuing retreating enemies (unless they have, for example, stolen something or kidnapped a person, and you need to retrieve it).\n\nAn exception: If an enemy surrenders, and then turns on whoever they surrendered to, the Yojimbo will not object to their death. Indeed, the hares will fight fight to kill that enemy, and any of that enemy's compatriots in that encounter, unless explicitly told not to.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Satsu no Usagi\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nFrom the deepest parts of the plains the hares roam, Satsu no Usagi is a loner, a singular, powerful entity who has always been a force to be reckoned with. The rest give him his space but he still manages to lash out occasionally.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Speed: 10\t\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nAs soon as Satsu no Usagi is on the field, he will attack the closest target besides you. If there is no other target? He will attack you. He will continue to kill until he can't find anyone. No one can escape his wrath.\n\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 1500\n<br> STR: 50\n<br> RES: 70\n<br> CHA: 80\n<br> DEX: 100\n<br> AGI: 150\n\n<br> Accuracy: 45\n<br> Dodge: +35\n<br> Genjutsu: +40\n<br> Damage Bonus: 17.0\n<br> Movement: 5 yard per IC\n\n<br> Athletics: +15\n<br> Awareness: +35\n<br> Resistance: +15\n<br> Stealth: +0\n\n<br> Chakra Exhaustion: +20\n<BR>\n\n###### Bad-Tempered Rodent\nThe mind of this rabbit is very singular. It is immune to Stun, Genjutsu, Immobilize, and takes half damage from Bleed, Ignite, or any other damage over time type ability. \n\n###### Elusive Target\nThe rabbit is small and has the luck of the moon! It has access to the Ninjutsu, Kawarimi. It also takes no damage from AoE attacks where it isn't the sole target.\n\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Sharp Teeth (Speed 8, AP 10)\nAnd he can leap about! When you use this attack, you can move up to 40 yards. This does 5d20 damage, and after you calculate it fully out, you double the total. In addition, it counts 50% higher for the purposes of wounding. It inflicts Slashing wounds and if it every inflicts a critical head, roll 1d20. On a 20, the opponent's head comes clean off and they die. \n\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nSummoning this creature is actually considered a Breach of Contract for the hare contract itself; the Murder Rabbit can still be summoned during the regular Breach of Contract period, which does not count as a 'new' offense (the rest of the contract will be usable again after the three OOC week period from the initial summoning of the Murder Rabbit). Once the Rabbit has been summoned it cannot be dismissed until it has taken at least one human life.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon Avatar: Tsuki no Usagi\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nThe Moon Rabbit is a large rabbit, though not in the same way that most summoned avatars are: it's barely two feet long from nose to tail. The rabbit has downy white fur, and keenly intelligent jade-green eyes. When summoned, it typically appears sitting upright on its haunches, with a mortar and pestle in front of it (how it handles the pestle with its paws is quite the mystery, though it seems to have no trouble doing so). When the rabbit speaks, it does so with a soft, serious, androgynous voice.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Speed: 40\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nThe hare avatar is not exactly a pacifist, but it does refuse to engage in combat (if it would even be able to defend itself is a largely academic question). Some summoners claim that they've been able to get it to negotiate with the avatars of other contracts, both leaving the field of battle, but even if the Moon Rabbit is willing to do that, it probably doesn't appreciate being used as, essentially, a glorified bargaining token.\n\nThe rabbit is not exactly friendly, though 'amicable' might be a fair description. It's a fairly serious creature, and while it will make an effort to be helpful to its summoners, it won't appreciate being treated like their personal dispensary or advisor on a regular basis. Despite its diminutive stature, it's still a summoned avatar.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\nAccording to legends, the Moon Rabbit lives on, well, the moon, where it prepares a magical elixir which grants the gods their immortality. This is probably not that rabbit, though there are certainly similarities.\n\nThe Moon Rabbit has extensive medical knowledge, and can identify almost any malady which might be affecting someone, and suggest treatments for almost any condition. If called upon to provide consultation for medical matters, it will freely do so, and its advice will almost always prove excellent. Though it won't stay for more than a few hours, that's enough time to coordinate the actions of an entire hospital for maximum efficiency, and set up highly effective triage procedures.\n\nMore commonly, however, shinobi will call upon it for its other famous skill: the rabbit is probably the greatest apothecary alive. It can produce restorative elixirs, medical poultices, antidotes for any known poison (and probably some that aren't known), and, supposedly, that mythical &quot;elixir of immortality.&quot; The lack of immortal shinobi suggests that it does not, in fact, confer immortality, however.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summoning Contact: Monkey\nPrimates are often seen as some of most intelligent of animals, in part because of their human-like appearances and mannerisms, a fact even more apparent in their shinobi counterparts. At the same time, monkeys are also known to be belligerent and irreverent, and prone to causing mischief when it suits them... which is just as true about their more intelligent, chakra-wielding counterparts.\n\nShinobi who form a contract with the monkeys need only a great deal of patience, but a healthy appreciation for satire and an ability to laugh at their own misfortunes (of which there will likely be quite a few) are necessary to avoid going mad with frustration.\n\nWhat sets monkeys apart from most of the counterparts is that they're capable of performing actual ninjutsu, complete with handseals. Not all of them can, and they don't have as wide a variety of techniques as actual shinobi, but it's still quite an impressive accomplishment compared to other animals (having human-like hands helps, no doubt).\n\nThe Avatar of the monkeys is the legendary Monkey King Enma, known to command a great deal of respect even from the avatars of other summonable species--other than the Queen of Spiders, Tsuchigumo, with whom he has a long-standing enmity. Among his more famous traits is his ability to transform into the Adamantime Staff, a legendary weapon said to be without equal.\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n<br> 800 XP: Monkey Messenger\n<br> 1200 XP: The Threefold Tools of the Monkey\n<br> 1600 XP: Partner Monkey\n<br> 2000 XP: Substitution Monkey\n<br> 2400 XP: Three Great Monkey Statues\n<br> 2500 XP: Summon: Handsome Monkey Prince\n<br> 4000 XP: Summon: Pillar-Supporting Monkey\n<br> 6000 XP: Summon: Monkey King Enma</text>\n\n## Techniques\n### --( Saru Tsukai - Monkey Messenger )--\nA small capuchin monkey dressed in a suit appears before the summoner. He bows politely, and usually follows that up with something bothersome, such as throwing a rock at a bystander, poking someone in the leg with a stick, baring his hindquarters at his summoner, or some other form of mostly-harmless message.\n\nHaving done so, the monkey then waits to be a given a message. The monkey can carry any small written document, or even recite a verbal message--though it's best to be wary of the latter. While the monkey will faithfully and accurately deliver all the information, he'll also add plenty of extra insults (directed at both the recipient and the summoner).\n\nAs a messenger, Tsukai is reliable in the sense that eventually he'll deliver whatever he was supposed to, and he's incredibly hard to catch. On the other hand, he can be far slower than most animal--for that matter, most human--messengers, given his propensity for taking 'breaks' and slacking off for upwards of a week at a time.\n\nOnce the message is delivered, Tsukai will 'inform' the summoner of this in the form of a prank--usually getting something shoved down the back of their pants or having a banana thrown at the back of their head, before the monkey vanishes. Now, if only he'd put that talent to use in delivering his messages.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nThe monkey can carry a trio of normal-sized scrolls, or any similar-sized objects--or even a small knapsack or other container (meaning it's not limited to just messages), and will bring it to a destination or person of your choice. If a person, you must tell the monkey where to look for them.\n\nIn combat the monkey hides after receiving the message, with a prodigious stealth bonus of +40. After hiding the monkey will proceed to run away at a speed of 3 yards every IC. If attacked it defends with a +20 to dodge, and has 100 Vitality.\n\nMessage delivery time is inconsistent at best, thanks to Tsukai's nature. No matter the distance he's sent (within the shinobi nations), the message takes 3d10 days to be delivered. This has nothing to do with difficulty getting there, and everything to do with Tsukai getting distracted and slacking off whenever he pleases, regardless of how important his task may be.\n\nMore than a few summoners are annoyed by Tsukai's unreliability, but, well... what can you do?\n\\page\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Sarusanbaigu - The Threefold Tools of the Monkey )--\nA long time ago, there actually were three tools, each with three abilities. Its was a catchy name, and accurate! Over time the monkeys picked up more tools, but haven't seen any reason to change the technique's name. A summoner trying to explain to them that it should be changed will be treated as if stupid by whichever monkey he happens to be speaking to.\n\nReally, it's best to just not bring the subject up.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\n<Br>\n\nEffects:\n<Br>\n\nThis summons a single item from the list below. Unlike most summoning techniques, there is no direct limitation on how often you may perform this one. However, each of the tools has its own duration (how long it will stay around before vanishing in a puff of smoke, even if you were busy using it), and its own amount of time you must wait before summoning that particular tool again.\n\n<Br>\n\nThis does mean that you could, if you needed, summon all five of the tools one after another in a single situation. Each of the tools can be targeted even if you're carrying it (treated as a called) shot. They have 100 Vitality and 100 DR, and vanish when their Vitality reaches 0.\n\n\n<Br>\n\n### = Kinaikagi - Golden Skeleton Key =\nAn ornate (really, gaudy) golden key with a handle sculpted to resemble the face of a monkey, complete with two small ruby eyes, and two prongs shaped like miniature grasping monkey arms, with the keys of teeth being the monkey's fingers. Curiously, it is able to fit keyholes of any size, though getting it to actually open the locks takes a bit of work.\n\n<Br>\n\nThe key functions as a +5 set of lockpicks that is always completely silent and never breaks. Additionally, it can be thrown at a lock within STR/4 yards. Using it this way requires an Espionage roll to &quot;pick&quot; the lock without the normal +5 bonus, as well as an Accuracy roll needing a (20 + 1 per yard the lock is away) to actually hit the lock. If successful, whatever was being targeted is immediately unlocked--though the key must be retrieved (or unsummoned).\n\n<Br>\n\nThe golden key can be summoned for up to an hour, once every month (4 OOC days).\n\n\n<Br>\n\n### = Saruhisa - The Monkey's Gourd = \nA small but highly polished and lacquered calabash gourd with a cap at the top and a bright scarlet rope to secure it to one's belt, the monkey's gourd doens't look like it should be able to hold more than half a gallon of liquid. Sometimes, it holds less; other times, it holds... much, much more. When summoned, the user can choose one of three liquids for the gourd to be filled with: water, sake, or an elixir. Regardles, the gourd can be summoned once a week (OOC day).\n\n<Br>\n\n   Water: The small gourd actually contains 20 gallons of water that can be used in jutsu, or for any normal purpose. The gourd lasts for 1 hour and can be refilled, but anything other than water put into it will curiously spill out despite the holder's best efforts.\n\n<Br>\n\n   Sake: Possibly a good reason to sign the monkey contract on its own, the gourd can pour out what amounts to one shot of sake every minute for 12 hours straight. After taking a drink (Speed 5) the user has to make a Resistance roll against 10 + 1 per drink after the first. Failure leaves them at a -1 penalty to Accuracy and skill rolls, stacking with itself. It's not all bad, though, as they gain a DR equal to the number of drinks they've had. This lasts for one hour per drink, and after it wears off leaves the most incredible, devastating, world-ending hangover any human is likely to experience.\n\n<Br>\n\n   Elixir: Supposedly a magical elixir, maybe just a special mixture of drugs. The elixir is meant for consumption by monkeys (who often face retribution for their mischevious pranks), but works for humans as well. Taking a drink (a Speed 10 action) allows a Resistance roll with a +2 against any status you're currently afflicted by which originally allowed one, against the original difficulty.\n\n<Br>\n\nThis only works against things requiring a status roll, and negates only the penalties caused from failing. Succeeding against a poison would end its effect entirely, while succeeding against Dragon Fire Technique would lower the Burns and Ignite by half their original severity; any damage already taken (or similar) is not undone.\n\n<Br>\n\nThe elixir lasts for 50 IC. Passing it on to someone else is a Speed 5 action.\n\n<Br>\n\\page\n\n\n\n###   = Gentou - Magic Lantern = \nAn ornate golden lantern; the top and bottom are in the shape of hexagonal cones, and the body has six gold-framed glass faces, with golden designs of monkeys engaged in various activities inlaid in the glass; when turned on in pitch blackness, this produces crisp shadow-outlines of the monkeys on nearby walls.\n\n<Br>\n\nInside the lantern is a golden flame that can be coaxed bright or darker with a whisper. The bottom of the lantern can be unlatched and opened, revealing some incomprehensible mechanical devices which, with a bit of experimentation, will raise internal shutters up to cover any combination of the glass panes (though, really, those shutters shouldn't be able to fit in there...). If you close all the shutters and ask the lantern to help you, it will open the shutter that is currently pointing north--letting it function as a compass. The light it sheds can change to any color you request.\n\n<Br>\n\nBy manipulating the shutters this can act like a lamp, a flashlight, or anything inbetween. It can illuminate a radius up to 40 yards (as a lamp), or a narrow cone up to 100 yards long (as a flashlight). It can shine in a smaller area by dimming the flame.\n\n<Br>\n\nFinally, if left in a spot and asked to look like a person it can create a vague illusion of a general type of person, large man, small child, thin woman; essentially a body shape and age/gender. The illusion can be seen through with an Awareness check of 10, +1 per yard away from it. This only works in poor lighting (such as at night), and uses up the lantern's duration 10 times as fast. The illusion can be performing any basic physical task, but nothing elaborate and nothing requiring it to move more than ten feet from the spot the lantern was set down at.\n\n<Br>\n\nGentou lasts for up to 10 hours before vanishing in a puff of smoke (or up to 1 hour if used as an illusion for the whole duration).\n\n<Br>\n\n\n ###  = Kinnawa - Golden Rope =\nCreated from golden monkey hairs braided into a thick rope, the Kinnawa is long enough to be used as an improvised belt when it appears. At the summoner's command it can extend or shorten again, and despite it's gaudy tassels on the ends it is very tough.\n\n<Br>\n\nBy far the best trick is that it can be thrown up into the air will it will anchor itself to something handy (like the edge of a roof) or absolutely nothing at all, at which point the summoner can climb up it; alternately, it could be thrown across an opening, and the other end anchored as well (on the ground, ideally) to let it be used like a tightrope. The summoner can cause the rope to un-anchor itself simply by willing it to do so while giving it a sharp tug.\n\n<Br>\n\nThe rope has a DR of 100, but can only take 10 damage before snapping. The segment closest to the summoner remains, while the rest vanishes in a puff of smoke. The rope can be thrown up to 50 + (the results of an Athletics roll) feet. Golden rope is also great for tying people up, giving a +20 bonus to the Espionage roll (instead of just +10).\n\n<Br>\n\nGolden rope will last for an hour, or eight hours if immediately used to tie somebody up. It can be summoned against one month (4 OOC days) later.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n ###  = Maitatsu Tsue - Dancing Staff =\nA long, gnarled walking stick, sturdy and sizable enough to be used as a bo staff by the summoner. It has the normal properties of a bo staff (from the Equipment chapter), plus a few unique characteristics.\n\n<Br>\n\nIf disarmed or discarded, the staff hops back up to a vertical position of its own volitiong and begins to pogo back to the summoner. The staff starts moving 1 IC after it's been disarmed, and moves 1 yard per IC; when moving like this, it can be 'picked up' as a Speed 0 action. Immobilization penalties slow it down normally.\n\n<Br>\n\nIf grabbed by anyone else the staff will wait 5 IC before striking them in the face and bouncing free, applying a Stun 4 effect and resuming its trip back to its summoner.\n\n<Br>\n\nOutside of combat, if propped up and told to 'stay' it will do just that. The staff will stand straight up, or at any improbable angle, as if held by an invisible force. It's virtually immovable like this, and can be used in all sorts of creative ways--such as hopping on top of it and posing dramatically.\n\n<Br>\n\nThe staff can be summoned for up to four hours, once every two weeks (2 OOC days).\n\n<Br>\n\\page\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Migawarizaru - Substitution Monkey )--\nMigawarizaru is summoned in response to an attack, the monkey taking the hit for the shinobi. Or, rather, one of his many clones does; a puff of smoke engulfs the 'ninja' who was just hit, revealing them to be a monkey, before that monkey vanishes in another puff of smoke. Moments later duplicates of the summoner begin appearing across the battlefield, each of them cloned monkeys disguised as the summoner via Henge no Jutsu. One of them is the summoned monkey himself, indistinguishable from the rest. In the ensuing confusion the summoner is free to either escape the battle, or take advantage of the situation to strike.\n\n  -  Chakra: 32\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: +6\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\n<Br>\n\nMigawizaru functions similarly to Kawarimi. You may use it after failing to dodge a technique, so long as partial defense applies. So long as the dodge's new total Speed (including the +6 from Migawizaru, and its Seal Speed) would allow it to be used as a valid Interrupt, you may pay 10 AP to fully dodge the attack and use this technique. As a reminder, while you could use AP to reduce the final Speed of Dodge + Migawiaru to 4 (2+6 = 8, to a minimum of half that with AP), the modified Seal Speed, if above 0, cannot be reduced this way.\n\n<Br>\n\nAfter the substitution is used, the monkey himself appears along with seven more clones on the battlefield, each of them disguised as the summoner and carrying on with some form of obnoxious antics. The summoner may choose to either immediately attempt to enter stealth (with their opponent(s) receiving an immediate Awareness roll against their Stealth roll), or automatically hide among clones as with a normal Bunshin technique.\n\n<Br>\n\nWhen the clones are targeted, roll 1dX; X is equal to the number of clones remaining, plus 1 for Migawizaru, plus 1 more if the summoner is hidden among them. On a roll of 1, the Migawizaru is hit and they all vanish. If the summoner is hidden among the clones, 1 hits the summoner (and all the clones vanish, along with Migawizaru) and 2 hits Migawizaru.\n\n<Br>\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Daisan Enchouzou - Three Great Monkey Statues )--\nTechnically a trio of separate summoning techniques, each one calling a separate giant stone monkey statue. The story behind these statues varies depending upon who you ask, but in the case of the actual summoning contract they serve as a conduit for the summoning of the Handsome Monkey Prince (or maybe he's just too vain to show up until the summoner's gone through the effort of calling the statues; really, it could be either one).\n\n<Br>\n\nEach of these techniques has a &quot;(30 - X)&quot; in its Chakra cost. X is the number of IC which have passed since the last time you summoned one of the three statues, with a minimum of 0. Thus, if you summoned one at the beginning of the battle, it would be Chakra 30; if you summoned another 50 IC later, it would also be Chakra 30; and if you summoned the last statue 10 IC after that, it would have a Chakra cost of 50.\n\n\n<Br>\n\n--( Iwazaru - Speak No Evil )--\nThe first monkey appears as 10 yard tall statue that looks to be made out of a gleaming metal of some sort. The statue is that of a sitting monkey covering its mouth with its hands. \n\n  -  Chakra: 30 + (30 - X)\n  -  Area: 100\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\n<Br>\n\nThe statue has 1000 Hit Points, and a Damage Reduction of 200 which applies against all thrown weapons other than Fuuma Shurike and Large Star Shuriken.\n\n<Br>\n\nAnyone within the area who speaks, or spends AP to control the actions of a summoned creature, loses half their current AP (after any such expenditure) and gains no AP the next time the initiative count reaches a multiple of 20. Taking any action with a Speed above 10 also incurs this effect, unless the shinobi is careful to be quiet, which amounts to taking a -2 immobilization penalty for their action. After suffering the statue's effects once, a shinobi will be able to figure out what will cause them from then on.\n\n<Br>\n\\page\n\n\n\n### --( Kikazaru - Hear No Evil )--\nAnother 10 yard tall statue, this monkey seems to be crafted of a solid white marble. It appears sitting atop the previous statue, hands covering its ears. \n\n  -  Chakra: 30 + (30-X)\n  -  Area: 100\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\n<Br>\n\nWhen Kikazaru is summoned, everyone present on the battlefield receives a &quot;Curse Counter&quot;, with its value starting at 0. Whenever someone takes an action, their counter is raised by that action's Speed. Every time the IC reaches a multiple of 10, the statue 'checks' to see who has the highest Curse Counter. That individual (or those individuals, if there's a tie) suffers a -4 immobilization penalty, and has their Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties doubled.\n\n<Br>\n\nThe immobilization penalty lasts until a new individual is cursed (and the Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion penalties double each time, if the same person is the victim repeatedly), or the statue is destroyed or unsummoned.\n\n<Br>\n\n\n### --( Mizaru - See No Evil )--\nThe final statue appears atop any previous statues, creating quite the impressive display being 30 yards tall when all three are in play. Also 10 yards tall, the statue appears to be made of a white wood, the monkey's hands covering its eyes. \n\n  -  Chakra: 30 + (30-X)\n  -  Area: 100\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\n<Br>\n\nWhenever anyone in Mizaru's area inflicts a wound on someone else, they suffer a -8 visibility penalty for 10 IC, +10 per level of severity of the wound (20 for a minor, 30 for a major, etc.). This ends prematurely if the statue is destroyed or unsummoned.\n\n<Br>\n\nMultiple afflictions from this statue don't stack. Longer durations overwrite shorter ones.</text>\n\nPartner Monkey\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nAppearing as a small brown capuchin, the Partner Monkey is a simple creature summoned to provide assistance with small tasks. Being of such small stature and with little to no combat skills, the Partner Monkey is quite skilled at sneaking into tight spots and stealing small objects. \n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nOne of the few monkeys that can't speak, the Partner Monkey can easily understand most orders, and if treated well it will be happy to follow any that don't put it into danger.  Not helping out of the goodness of it's own heart... the Partner Monkey likes to be given treats. Fruits and candies are usually enough to get it to perform most any task that it doesn't think is immediately dangerous.\n\n\\page\n\n\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 400\n<br> STR: 20\n<br> RES: 40\n<br> CHA: 20\n<br> DEX: 60\n<br> AGI:  60\n<br> Accuracy: 30\n<br> Dodge: +20\n<br> Damage Bonus: 1.3\n<br> Athletics: +15\n<br> Awareness: +10\n<br> Espionage: +15\n<br> Resistance: +5\n<br> Stealth: +20\n\n\n\n###### Almost Tireless\nPartner Monkeys do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls for their actions. Instead, they reduce their current Vitality by (Stamina or Chakra cost)*3.  They do not normally accumulate penalties to Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion; if they have penalties from an outside source (such as Suffocation or some poisons), add those to the effective Stamina or Chakra cost to determine how much Vitality they lose.\n\n<Br>\n\n###### Dextrous Fingers\nA Partner Monkey has small hands with powerful fingers, allowing it to pick locks without the use of any lockpicks.\n<Br>\n\n\n###### Extraordinary Reflexes\nGiven the monkey's agility, it can dodge attacks as a Speed 0 interrupt. \n\n<Br>\n\n###### Small\nThe Partner Monkey is very small and light, being able to move while still maintaining Stealth 2. In addition, all knockback effects have their efficacy doubled. \n<Br>\n\n\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n######    Standard Actions\nPartner Monkey may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. \n\n<Br>\n\n######   Bite (Speed 8, 4 AP)\nNot an amazing combatant, the Partner Monkey usually gets out of dangerous situations using it's teeth. A bite inflicts 4d6 piercing damage and is considered a basic unarmed attack. The Partner Monkey's bite is far more painful than it is actually damaging and if used in a grapple, it gets a +10 to the check to escape the grapple.\n\n<Br>\n\n######   Scout (Speed Variable, 10 AP)\nOne of the few uses of the Partner Monkey in a combat situation, the Summoner can send the Partner Monkey out to scout an area. This works by giving the monkey a general location to scout out and choosing how long they wish the monkey to be gone. The Partner Monkey can move 3 yards per IC towards the location. Once there the monkey does a quick search(using up 0 IC), but can also use 6 more IC to do a search actions. When declaring a scouting action you may choose to set a time for the monkey to return in which case it will only have scouted the area it was able to reach before have to come back... or you may have the Partner Monkey simply go to an area and search a few times(your choice) before coming back. Note that the speed of the action is based upon how far the Partner Monkey has to travel(and travel back from) as well as time spent searching. Upon it's return, the Monkey will perform a sort of pantomime that for some reason the Summoner is able to understand and gain general details about the scouted area. These details include: general terrain, prescence of enemies(that it saw using awareness), and any obstacles.\n\n<Br>\n\n######   Monkey Mission (Speed Variable, 5 AP per action/skill use)\nSimilar to the Scout action, the summoner sends the Monkey on a non-dangerous mission utilizing it's skills. This could be as simple as hopping over a fence and undoing a latch from the other side to as complicated as scaling a building, unlocking a window, opening a safe, and finally stealing a set of plans before coming back. Like scouting, the Partner Monkey can move 3 yards per IC and requires 10 IC for each use of a skill other than awareness. The Monkey can be sent on a wide range of missions, but be warned that if it senses any danger it can't be sure to avoid it will abandon the mission and return rather than braving the odds.\n\n<Br>\n\n######   Perform Ninjutsu (Speed Variable, Variable AP)\nThe Partner Monkey can actually perform a small selection of Ninjutsu, or be commanded to perform them at a set time. The Partner Monkey has a Seal Speed reduction of 6, and does not use Stamina or Chakra rolls when using the Jutsu it knows. Instead, subtract (Chakra Cost)*3 from the Partner Monkey's Vitality whenever it uses a Jutsu. The Summoner has to spend AP equal to 1/2 the speed of the jutsu(including the remaining seal speed). \n   =Jutsu Known= \nNinjutsu: Henge no Jutsu : Limited to a small wind up monkey toy with cymbals.\n<Br>\n\nNinjutsu: Genjutsu Kai : Can use on the summoner, but only if commanded to.\n<Br>\n\nFuuton: Soujikaze no Jutsu : Clearing out smoke and mist.\n<Br>\n\nFuuton: Kazekiri : Cutting ropes or making openings in thin barriers.\n<Br>\n\nFuuton: Rakuyou Buyou : Escaping once it sees danger.\n<Br>\n\nFuuton: Nagare : To leap down from extreme heights.\n\n\\page\n\n\n\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe partner monkey has been known to refuse a mission if it does not receive a treat or trinket as payment when summoned or given particular taxing tasks (most ninja capable of summoning it will keep a bag of peanuts or a few shiny beads around, for just this purpose).\n<Br>\n\n\nIf the summoner knowingly sends the monkey into danger (deliberate combat, or as a decoy), the partner monkey will immediately leave, and this will be considered a Breach of Contract. Even afterwards, the monkey will be grumpy when summoned, and require heavy condolences (bananas work wonders) before listening to the summoner at all.\n<Br>\n\n\nBeing summoned to help the summoner when they're in genuine, dire need (meaning the summoner is already fighting, and doesn't, for example, immediately hide or flee once the monkey shows up) is acceptable, but the monkey does not like it and will only perform up to four actions (be they attacks or jutsu) before it protests and leaves in a puff of smoke. Again, it will require an 'apology' in the form of gifts before helping again.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Monkey Prince\n>1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nThe Handsome Monkey Prince (or, &quot;Tansei Sarukou&quot;) has an almost human stature, bipedal and close to six feet tall, resembling a man with the fur and tail of a monkey. He's also possessed of incredibly good looks, disarming charm, and phenomenal wit... or, so he tells it. He appears dressed in a bright red breasplate, bracers, and greaves, along with fine black pants and a gaudy golden belt.\n\n  -  Chakra: 120 \n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nThe best way to summon the Prince is to first provide a fitting demonstration of one's admiration for him by summoning the Three Great Monkey Statues. If one is present on the battlefield, his Chakra cost is reduced to 100; if two are present, it's reduced to 80. If all three statues are present in battle, it only costs 40 Chakra to summon the prince.\n<Br>\n\n\nWhen he's summoned, the statues vanish. The statues themselves cannot be summoned while he's present on a battlefield.\n<Br>\n\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n<Br>\n\n\nMost believe the Monkey Prince added the 'handsome' to his own name, a testament to his own pride and vanity.\n<Br>\n\n\nWhen summoned, he will 'politely' ask the summoner to stand back and watch him  handle the problem at hand. The more of the statues that were summoned before he was, the more politel he'll be. With all three having been used to summon him he'll show up ready and enthusiastic to jump into a fight, so long as the summoner doesn't try to boss him around. Without any having been used the Monkey Prince will be positively snobbish, and will only fight on the summoner's behalf if said summoner shows him great respect.\n<Br>\n\n\nIn combat, the Monkey Prince actively mocks and humiliates his opponents, dancing around and delivering alternating attacks and taunts. He expects his summoner to stand back and simply watch as the Prince does his thing, unless the Prince is being attacked by a summoner and a summoned creature simultaneously--in which case he expects the summoner to assist him.\n<Br>\n\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 2200\n<br> STR: 100\n<br> RES: 100\n<br> CHA: 100\n<br> DEX: 120\n<br> AGI: 120\n<br> Accuracy: 35\n<br> Dodge: +30\n<br> Damage Bonus: 6.0\n<br> Athletics: +30\n<br> Awareness: +25\n<br> Espionage: +20\n<br> Resistance: +15\n<br> Stealth: +25\n\n\n###### Extraordinary Reflexes\nGiven the Monkey Prince's agility, he can dodge attacks as a Speed 0 interrupt. \n\n###### Golden Flip\nThe Monkey Prince suffers no penalty to dodge area of effect techniques, and upon succesfully dodging one can move to any edge of the area automatically.\n\n###### Tireless\nThe Monkey Prince does not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when he acst(other than performing jutsu). If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +10 to their rolls.\n \n###### Independent\nThe Monkey Prince is too vain to be given orders by the Summoner. Instead the Monkey Prince will simply attack anyone immediately hostile to his loyal subject(the summoner). In addition, the Monkey Prince acts of his own volition, not requiring AP from the summoner.\n\n\\page\n\n\n###### Mountain-Conquering Pride\nIf pitted against another summoned creature, the Handsome Monkey Prince receives a bonus to his Accuracy, dodge, and skill rolls equal to (the minimum listed XP needed to summon that creature)/500, and an increase to his damage bnous equal to (that amount of XP)/1000, to one decimal place as usual. If its XP level is 4000 or higher, he does not pay any cost when using his ninjutsu against them.\n\nIf fighting a person, these bonuses instead come from that individual's actual XP (sub-total XP, in the case of clanless). If fighting both people and summons (or multiple of either), he only uses the highest bonus.\n\n\n###### Peerless Champion\nThe monkey prince uses only a fraction of his real strength in order to give his opponents a sporting chance, and if someone exceeds his expectations will raise them accordingly. Every time one of his attacks misses, he gains +2 Accuracy for the rest of the battle. Every time he fails to dodge an attack, he gains +1 dodge for the rest of the battle. Finally, every time the damage from one of his attacks is completely prevented (such as by DR, or the Earth Shore Return technique) his physical and ninjutsu damage bonuses are both increased by 2 for the remainder of the battle.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n######    Standard Actions\nThe Monkey Prince may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB.\n\n######   Strike (Speed 8)\nSkilled with using his hands, feet, tail, and most other parts of his body as a weapon the Monkey Prince can strike pretty hard when he wants to. While he could hit much harder than he does--he's strong enough to lift mountains overhead, he'll assure his summoners--he prefers to goad his opponents with weaker, glancing blows. A strike from the Prince does 10d10 Blunt damage, as a basic unarmed attack.\n\n######   Golden Cloud (Speed 4)\nThe Monkey Prince is well known for his flying Golden Cloud, and for the listed speed he can summon it to his side and hop on. It is, as its name suggests, a small opaque golden cloud, about four feet across. The Prince can sit or stand on it; anyone else simply falls through. On the cloud the Monkey Prince has a +3 bonus to dodge and can move 5 yards every IC. If he makes an attack or uses a jutsu he dismounts from the cloud, and has to call it again to receive its benefits. Despite its ability to fly, the cloud can only reach an altitude of 30 yards. The Prince claims this is an arbitrary limit he has imposed upon it in combat, to make fights more fair for his opponents.\n\n\n######   Decoy (Speed 5, Interrupt)\nWhen attempting to dodge against a melee-range attack and gaining only a partial success, the Monkey Prince can spend 50 Vitality to avoid the attack entirely and leave a clone behind. The prince immediately makes a Stealth roll with a +15 bonus, opposed by his opponent's Awareness. On success, the Prince is hidden and the opponent thinks the clone is the prince.\n\nThe clone will call the opponent names, taunt them, and dodge attacks until it's hit--at which point it's destroyed, as with a normal clone, and the enemy will realize what happened. However, the Prince will still be hidden!\n\n\n######   Perform Ninjutsu (Speed Variable)\nThe Monkey Prince knows ninjutsu! It's mostly something he learned because it was interesting, but he got bored and stopped learning jutsu after picking a few Katon and Fuuton techniques. He could learn all the ninjutsu if he pleased, but it would be much too troublesome.\n\nHe reduces Seal Speeds by 12, and does not make Stamina or Chakra rolls when using jutsu. Instead, his current Vitality is reduced by (Chakra cost)*3 whenever he performs a jutsu. The Prince knows the following techniques:\n=Jutsu Known= \nFuuton: Wind Release Stream\nFuuton: Great Breakthrough (generally used to knock people away before they get close, for harassment purposes)\nFuuton: Violent Wind Palm (he doesn't carry any throwing weapons)\nFuuton: Wind Turtle's Shell\nFuuton: Vaulting Leap \nKaton: Flame Flower\nKaton: Sticky Fire Technique\nKaton: Grand Fireball\nKaton: Great Dragon Fire\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe Handsome Monkey Prince is extremely vain and self-important. If the summoner doesn't show him proper respect and deferential treatment (flattery always helps), the Prince will get annoyed and leave. There are many nobles who aboslutely abhor sycophants, but the Handsome Monkey Prince is not one of them. The more the summoner praises and fawns over him, the more the Prince will like the summoner and enjoy being called out to assist them.\n\nIn combat, once the Monkey Prince is summoned he will expect the summoner to stand aside and let the Prince fight. If the summoner tries to help the Monkey Prince will tell him to stop, and step aside; if the summoner continues, the Prince will get angry and leave.\n\nThat being said, if his enemy goes out of their way to attack the summoner, the Prince won't object to them defending themselves or retaliating. Similarly, if he's fighting a summoner and their own summoned creature, he won't mind his own summoner helping him. However, in other situations he'll want to fight alone (or possibly with the help of other summoned monkeys), even if outnumbered.\n\\page\n\n\n## Pillar Monkey\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nGuardians against evil, Munamochisaru (&quot;Pillar-Supporting Monkeys&quot;) are strong enough to act as pillars and hold the roofs of massive shrines up. They're enormous, more than forty feet tall and rippling with muscles; despite being often mistaken for apes, they are, in fact, giant monkeys. These enormous, brown-furred creatures are far more serious than most of their kin, some of the most dutiful and honor-bound of their species, and prove quick to defend their summoners.\n\nThat said, they're not much use for anything that doesn't involve brute force. Being a forty foot tall monkey sort of... has that effect.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Speed: 25\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nSupposedly, the Munamochi-saru can speak and perform handseals like other monkeys can--however, none of them ever seem to do so. They understand orders, and seem to be quiet intelligent, but say nothing in response, usually just gruffly nodding their heads, occasionally grunting in affirmation, and solving problems with their muscles.\n\nThey're quick to use their size and strength to defend the summoner and any of the summoner's friends or allies. They'll also actively defend the pure and innocent, even without orders (this almost always includes children; adults are another matter entirely). They usually have no qualms about attacking the summoner's enemies, but will try to minimalize collateral damage, as they're very capable of tearing up massive areas of the landscape when they fight.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n<br> Vitality: 4500\n<br> STR: 180\n<br> RES: 140\n<br> CHA: 100\n<br> DEX: 120\n<br> AGI:  120\n<br> Accuracy: 46\n<br> Damage Bonus: 20.0\n<br> Athletics: +30\n<br> Awareness: +35\n<br> Espionage: +15\n<br> Resistance: +25\n<br> Stealth: +10\n\n\n###### Extended Range\nMunamochi-Saru have a 10 yard attack range, which is still melee due to their large size. \n\n###### Huge\nMunamochi-Saru cannot be tripped or knocked airborne, and any knockback effects have their efficacy reduced by half. However, they also cannot dodge or block.\n\n###### Tireless\nMunamochi-Saru do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when they act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +25 to their rolls.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n   Standard Actions\nMunamochi-Saru may use Move as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. They may use Take The Hit normally, but commanding them to do so costs 4 AP.\n\n######   Monkey Smash (Speed 10, 4 AP)\nThe giant monkey punches, claws, or kicks those that it's set against. This deals 14d20 Blunt or Slashing damage, and is considered a basic unarmed attack.\n\n\n######   Ground Pound (Speed 20, 8 AP)\nBalling up both fists, Munamochi-saru slams both hands into the ground or upon a downed opponent in a hammering motion. Chakra is poured into the ground and it shatters, opening up around the monkey before it hops back out of the area. This strikes an area of 40 yards with a penalty of -2 to accuracy. It deals 28d20 damage and is considered Unarmed Taijutsu. If used on a prone target, Ground Pound's damage is considered 150% higher for inflicting wounds. \nth a -2 penalty in place of Ground Pound's normal accuracy.\n\\page\n\n\n\n######   Tail Sweep (Speed 6, 5 AP)\nAs Munamochi-saru are such a huge and imposing monkeys, most think of them as apes. However, they are in fact still monkeys, and as such have tails. A tail sweep usually involves the monkey feinting forwards ominously with one arm, then whipping their tail out to sweep an opponent off their feet. This attack only does 6d12 damage; if it hits, the victim next gets an Awareness roll against the monkey's Accuracy. If they pass, they suffer a Stun 2. If they fail, they're left prone as per the E-rank Trip taijutus.\n\nTail Sweep always rolls Accuracy, using 1d20+36. If it knocks someone prone, the Munamochi-saru can pay 5 AP and immediately follow up with a Ground Pound (at its normal AP cost, and adding its normal Speed to when the monkey will act next) at that target, using its Tail Sweep accuracy wi\n\n######   Monkey Pillar (Speed 3+X, Interrupt, X AP, Chakra 10+2*X)\nIn addition to acting as living pillars, the Munamochi-saru are quite capable of creating them. Driving their hands into the ground (be it loose earth or solid stone), they can lift a solid wall or pillar in front of them. Even if used on dirt or sand, the pillar will be hardened into solid stone when it's raised this way.\n\nThis is used as a defensive Interrupt, automatically succeeding and blocking up to X*100 damage. Any damage over thi amount carries through to the Munamochi-saru. This is treated as a Doton ninjutsu, and takes double damage from Raiton, but only half from Sution. Anyone within five yards of the monkey will also be protected by this wall. It can only be used against attacks originating 10 yards or more away from the Munamochi-saru.\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe pillar-supporting monkeys are not dim-witted, but are still fairly simple creatures. As long as the summoner doesn't ask them to do more than use their brute strength and size, they'll get along just fine.\n\nThe one thing they will never do is harm pure-hearted innocents, and attempting to convince one to do so knowingly is a Breach of Contract.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon Avatar: Enma\n\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nEnma is an eight foot tall, white-furred monkey with a body structure similar to a human, allowing him to walk upright and swing from limbs like an ape. He wears a black suit with mesh armor underneath, and to top it off a sleeveless kimono made of tiger fur with white trim and held closed with a sash. He usually has a very grumpy look on his face. \n\n  -  Chakra: 65\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 35\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nMonkeys are somewhat fickle and it can be quite a complicated process to gain their trust. That said, once the Monkey King has grown fond of someone (a long process) he will treat them as a member of his monkey troop and fight fiercely to protect them. That said, Monkeys have plenty of better things to be doing with their time and Enma doesn't like being summoned for frivolous purposes. \n\nHaving grown quite old and cantankerous, Enma will only answer a summons if the summoner's life is on the line. Where that line is drawn is dependent on how well he knows the summoner in question. He also has a long-standing unfriendly rivalry with the Spider Queen Tsuchigumo, and will answer any summons to fight her.\n\nEnma does not generally take orders. He'll do what the summoner needs, but will usually decide for himself how he wants to go about accopmlishing their goal. The better the summoner's rapport with Enma, the more closely he'll cooperate with them. If Enma has faith in his summoner's abilities, he may even use his ability to transform into the legendary Adamantine Staff, a weapon said to be indestructible and possessed of numerous supernatural capabilities, for his summoner to wield.\n\nIn addition, Enma is well-schooled in the ninja arts and has an extensive suite of ninjutsu he can perform. He actually outclasses many ninja with his jutsu use. While other Avatars are immense beasts capable of causing destruction on a massive scale, the Monkey King Enma is smarter, more skilled, and able to become an undefeatable weapon in the right hands.</text>\n\n\n<img \n  src='http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/f/fe/Enma%27s_full_appearance.png/revision/latest?cb=20150130141537' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n\\page\n\n\n\n## Salamander Contract\nUnlike many of the other creatures a Shinobi might form a contract with, Salamanders care little for the summoners. They come when called, but that's about it; they can't (or at least don't) speak, and while they're never reluctant to help in battle, nor are they eager. They go about it as a matter of course, suggesting perhaps a still very bestial nature.\n\nWhile this means that a summoner doesn't have to worry about offend their summon or incurring its animosity, it also means that salamanders don't particularly care about looking out for their summoner. In combat they can be frightening indiscriminate in the devastation they unleash. An unprepared summoner can easily get themselves or their allies wiped out by collateral damage.\n\nTo counteract that, and perhaps as an indication that the salamanders do have something resembling good will towards those who call on them, before being able to summoner any of the creatures themselves a summoner will first gain the ability to summon the blood of the beasts, which has various effects which, when properly applied, can give them some degree of protection from the creatures they call.\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n<br> 1000 XP: Red Blood\n<br> 1500 XP: Black Blood\n<br> 2000 XP: Blue Blood\n<br> 2500 XP: Summon: Chameleon\n<br> 3000 XP: Summon: Basilisk\n<br> 4000 XP: Summon: Ibuse\n<br> 5000 XP: Summon: Ka Riu</text>\n### --( Kuchiyose: Akachi - Summoning: Red Blood )--\nYou summon a small clay jug filled with thick, viscous red blood. The blood from this particular salamander species is known for  its incredible flame-retardant properties.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nIf you take a Speed 8 action to smear the blood over yourself, you become highly resistant to heat and fire.\n\nFor the next 200 IC, you are immune to the Ignite status effect and any ongoing Ignites will end. You become immune to Burns, but existing Burns won't be removed. You cannot be wounded by Katon, and the severity of wounds from para-elements based on Katon (Shakuton and Futton) are reduced by one category. Finally, you take 25% less damage from Katon or its advanced elemental forms.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Kurochi - Summoning: Black Blood )--\nYou summon a small earthenware decanter filled with a pitch-black liquid the consistency of water. The blood of this species of salamander is poisonous--but, a single whiff of the stuff would be enough to convince most people not to even consider drinking it.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nIf you take a Speed 4 action to drink the blood, you... are poisoned!\n\nThis has a Poison 1 effect, with a Duration of 1000 IC. However, the black blood blocks the action of any other poisons: while you can be poisoned, so long as the black blood is coursins through your veins you will ignore their effects, and their own durations will expire normally.\n\nYou may purge the black blood from your system as a Speed 10 action, by &quot;unsummoning&quot; it.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Aochi - Summoning: Blue Blood )--\nYou summon a small wooden bowl with a tepid, syrupy substance inside it. If you hadn't figured it out yet, it's salamander blood, said to have mystical properties!\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Speed: 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nYou may close your eyes and take a Speed 5 action to coat your eyelids in the blue blood.\n\nFor the next 100 IC, or until you open your eyes or wipe the blood away, you can 'see' despite your eyes being closed, viewing the world as black and all objects as chalky white outlines. While disorienting, it's quite effective.\n\nYou halve all visibility penalties for the duration, and are immune to any effects requiring eye contact. Additionally, you have a +5 bonus to all your Awareness rolls, as this unnatural sight eliminates most visual distractions.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Chameleon\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nEven normal chameleons were, in the past, thought of as being supernatural monsters, so finding one among the ranks of summoned animals shouldn't be surprising. Why the salamander contract covers something which is technically a lizard, and not an amphibian, however, remains mysterious.\n\nAloof and uncaring like the other animals it shares a contract with, the chameleon serves as ask and then leaves promptly. The chamaleon is fairly small by the standards of summoned animals, &quot;only&quot; big enough for two people to crouch fairly inside its mouth with moderate discomfort. With long limbs, a tail that ends in a curling spiral, and some of the strangest eyes of any creature, the chameleon is certainly a unique sight.\n\nWhile regular chameleons can blend in with their surroundings, this one can alter the color and reflectiveness of its skin so well as to be virtually invisible. It can walk across virtually any surface, and while it prefers to avoid combat its long, sticky, extendable tongue can be wielded with stunning speed and deftness.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nLike most creatures summoned by the salamander contract, the chameleon really doesn't care about its summoner. Unlike the others, it's typically not willing to risk injury in battle, either. It has no problem being near or even in a battlefield, so long as it's not taking any sort of damage or having to defend itself.\n\nWhen it's summoned, the summoner may choose to &quot;bribe&quot; the chameleon by increasing the Chakra cost by 15. If this is done, it will stay and fight in combat, albeit reluctantly.\n\nIf not, the chameleon will flee as soon as it's injured. It will gives its summoner up to 10 IC to climb into its mouth before doing so; if carrying a shinobi, it will turn invisible and try to run away. If it's not carrying anyone by the end of those 10 IC, it will simply un-summon itself.\n\nIf ever left to wait around (say, outside a building while the summoner infiltrates it), the chameleon will wander up to 5d10 yards in any direction looking for insects and small animals to eat.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 1000\n\n<br> STR: 100\n<br> RES: 60\n<br> CHA: 40\n<br> DEX: 80\n<br> AGI: 80\n\n<br> Accuracy: 35\n<br> Dodge: +30\n<br> Damage Bonus: 6.6\n<br> Movement: 6 yards per IC.\n\n<br> Athletics: +15\n<br> Awareness: +25\n<br> Resistance: +15\n<br> Stealth: +30\n<BR>\n\n###### Agile\nThe chameleon does not suffer AoE penalties for dodging area-of-effect techniques, and indeed has a +5 bonus to dodge them.\n\n###### Bestial  \nThe Chameleon isn't driven by higher desires, and as a result it cannot be negotiated or reasoned with. It has a +10 bonus to its rolls against genjutsu.\n\n###### Expert Climber\nDue to a combinatino of chakra control, grasping claws, and small sticky pads on its feet, the chameleon can climb along any wall or surface, even upside-down, without any effort. Any immobilization penalties it suffers from the condition of the terrain are halved.\n\n###### Flee\nWhen the chameleon is fleeing (see &quot;Terms of Contract&quot;), it has a +5 bonus to dodge, cannot be stunned, reduces all immobilization penalties by 3, and moves at full speed when in Camouflage.\n\n###### Large\nGiven the chameleon's size, it can make melee attacks at a range of up to 5 yards.\n\n###### Tireless\nChameleons do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when they act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +10 to their rolls.\n\\page\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nThis Summon may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n\n###### Camouflage (Speed 20, 10 AP)\nThe chameleon blends into its surroundings, turning almost completely invisible. While camouflaged it can move at only half its normal speed, and is in Stealth 2. A camouflaged chameleon can Hide as a Speed 10 (5 AP) action, even if the normal requirements for hiding are not met. When rolling for stealth, and dodging in camouflage, the chameleon rolls 2d20.takeHighest(1) rather than 1d20.\n\n###### Swat (Speed 8, 5 AP)\nUsing one is its legs or tail, the Chameleon swings at an enemy as a last resort to get them away. This inflicts 8d10 Blunt damage and counts as a basic unarmed attack, which knocks whoever was hit 3d6 yards away and.\n\n###### Tongue Lash (Speed 10, 8 AP)\nSpitting out its tongue in a frog-like fashion, the chameleon lashes out and smacks a target with blinding speed. This inflicts 6d6 Blunt damage, a Stun 5, and trips anyone who doesn't pass an Athletics roll against the chameleon's. Used against any form of bug or insects (including Aburame swarms and Spider summons) this attack inflcits double damage. This attack has a 20 yard range.\n\n###### Wrap-Up (Speed 15, 10 AP)\nThe chameleon attempts to capture and enemy with its tongue. This attack has a 20 yard range. If this hits, the opponent has an Immobilize penalty of 1 for every point their defense failed by (if their dodge was a 31 against the chameleon's 35 accuracy, they'd be at Immobilize -4). Someone hit this way cannot move more than 20 yards away from the chameleon; the chameleon can move only at half speed while someone is wrapped this way. This lasts until the chameleon takes an action other than moving or dodging. The other way to escape is to hit the tongue with a slashing or piercing attack that does more than 100 damage in a single hit, which will slice off its tongue (and cause it to flee; see &quot;Terms of Contract&quot;).\n\n\n###### Carry (Speed 20 / See Text, Variable AP)\nThe chameleon is large enough to fit two people inside its mouth and carry them around; in combat, climbing into its mouth is a Speed 10 action that requires the person to be standing directly next to the chameleon, while it's a Speed 20 action for the chameleon to safely close its mouth around them. There's enough air to last one person ten minutes, or two people five minutes. After this time is up, the people inside suffer a Suffocation 1 every 5 IC until the chameleon opens its mouth.\n\nWith its mouth open, the benefits of camouflage are suspended (reduced to stealth one, doesn't roll 2d20, cannot hide in plain sight, but it does not break stealth if already hidden) and the chameleon can only move at half speed to avoid spilling its passengers out. Out of combat this takes less than a minute; in combat, it takes 30 IC for the air supply to be replenished.\n\nOrdering the chameleon to move while in its mouth is 1 AP for every 5 IC the chameleon spends moving, and it cannot make tongue attacks (Tongue Lash and Wrap-Up) while carrying someone in its mouth.\n\nBeing inside the chameleon's mouth makes it generally impossible to affect the outside world, and imposes a complete loss of visibility, with one exception. Someone using the blue blood can see through the chameleon's mouth, and view the outside world.9\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe chameleon will flee under the following circumstances:\n - It wasn't bribed, and it takes any damage.\n - Its Vitality falls below 25%.\n - Its tongue is cut off.\n\nWhen it decides to flee, the summoner has 10 IC to get into its mouth before it does so. If it has no passengers at that point, it un-summons itself. If it does, it enters camouflage as a Speed 0 action and will no longer take orders from the summoner, and does not use the summoner's AP.\n\nIf the chameleon has its tongue cut off while using its Wrap-Up ability, that summoner cannot summon a chameleon again for the next 2 OOC weeks, although this is not considered to be a Breach of Contract for salamanders as a whole.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Basilisk\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nBasilisks bear a very strong resemblance to the very much mundane komodo dragon, four legs bowed out nearly parallel to the ground, leaving it to drag its belly across the ground for most of its movements while also able to rise up for a shockingly fast run.\n\nThe first difference is that the basically is about as tall as a shed, and proportionately longer. The second is its coloration. The basilisk's hide, while leathery to the touch, is iridescent in coloration, ranging from midnight blue to nearly shining cyan depending on the angle one views it from. It is, most people agree, and incredibly beautiful sight to behold... for the few moments one can view it.\n\nLegends say that the basilisk's gaze can turn a person to stone, and in reality it at the very least causes a disturbingly similar effect. Nobody's sure exactly what causes this (it being rather difficult to test without... turning to stone), but what is known is that not looking at the creature, and specifically avoiding seeing its eyes, is able to prevent this effect.\n\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nLike most salamanders, the basilisk is uncaring in combat. The deadly gaze of the beast is as harmful as the summoner to all others, and the basilisk won't take any special care to avoid petrifying the one who called it into battle.\n\nIn combat its preferred tactic is simply to petrify everyone in sight, but if anyone gets too close or attacks it, it's capable of lashing out with tooth, claw, and tail. Additionally, people failing to meet its gaze can make it irritable and aggressive\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 1800\n\n<br> STR: 100\n<br> RES: 120\n<br> CHA: 60\n<br> DEX: 80\n<br> AGI: 80\n\n<br> Accuracy: 32\n<br> Dodge: +22\n<br> Damage Bonus: 8.3\n\n<br> Stamina: +15\n<br> Chakra Exhaustion: +10\n\n<br> Athletics: +20\n<br> Awareness: +20\n<br> Resistance: +20\n<BR>\n\n###### Bestial\nThe Basilisk isn't driven by higher desires like many other summons (and ninja), as a result it cannot be bribed or reasoned with. It has a +10 bonus to its defenses aginst any form of genjutsu.\n\n\n###### Thick Hide\nBasilisks have a Damage Reduction of 60.\n\n\n###### Large\nGiven the Basilisk's building-smashing size, it can make melee attacks at a range of up to 10 yards. Humans, and summons without the Large or Huge attributes, cannot grapple the basilisk.\n\n\n###### Obvious\nBasilisks are giant amphibians with iridescent skin. They cannot hide.\n\n\n###### Petrifying Gaze\nAnyone within 50 yards of the basilisk is vulnerable to being petrified by its gaze, includin the summoner. Whenever someone see it, they begin to turn to stone. Every 10 IC they have their Petrify status increased by 1; there is no direct defense, resistance roll, or immunity allowed to this, except as described below.\n\nThere are three ways to avoid this. The first is to keep one's eyes closed, applying a -10 visibility penalty. The second is to keep one's eyes focused on the basilisk's feet, applying only a -4 visibility penalty, though comes with a risk. If a ninja is damaged by an attack while doing this, they have a (damage taken /10)% chance to have their Petrify status increased by 1. The final method is for the basilisk or the summoner to be at a -6 visibility penalty.\n\nIf one stops using one of those methods, their Petrify immediately increases by 1, and the &quot;every 10 IC&quot; for that individual begins taking place based on that time.\n\n\n###### Petrify\nThis is a special status effect. Petrify also applies an Immobilization penalty equal to its rank, which cannot be reduced by effects which explicitly reduce immobilization. Once a person's Petrification status reaches 10 they turn to solid stone over the next several seconds, killing them irrevocably. At lower ranks its manifests as an increasingly severe stiffness and numbness across one's entire body.\n\nIn addition, once Petrify reaches 3, the victim's Elemental Affinity is shifted to Doton. If this was already their elemental affinity, it has no effect. If it was not, they also receive a penalty equal to their Elemental Affinity rank to all non-Doton Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra Control rolls.\n\n\\page\n\nFor example, if you had rank 4 Elemental Affinity: Fire, once your Petrify reached 3 you would have a +4 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra Control rolls with Doton, and a -4 to all others--including those related to non-elemental jutsu.\n\nAfter 50 IC of not having one's Petrify status increase, it begins to fade at a rate of 1 per 20 IC. Once applied, the change to elemental affinity will take 24 hours to be reversed.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions (Speed as normal)\nA Basilisk may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n\n###### Fang and Claw (Speed 6, 5 AP)\nThe Basilisk charges, moving up to 10 yards and making a melee range attack with its fangs or claws inflicting 10d10 Piercing or Slashing damage. This counts as a basic unarmed attack, and may target up to three people in its range. If directed against a single target, the basilisk's damage bonus is increased by 50%.\n\n###### Stone Glare (Speed 10, 25 AP, Chakra 25)\nThe basilisk's eyes widen, its scales shimmer, and... something, happens. Everyone within 50 yards of the basilisk has their Petrify status raised by 1, even if they're not looking at it. This will also turn small animals and plants to stone; after three uses, an entire area is petrified: the ground has become solid rocks, trees are stone through and through, and any low-flying birds will fall from the sky. Water is safe from the effects, but aquatic life is not.\n\n###### Tail Sweep (Speed 10, 8 AP)\nSwinging its large and powerful tail like a scythe, the Basilisk clears the area behind and around it. This counts as an Area 10 attack that deals 15d8 Blunt damage and inflicts Stun 6, as well as a 12 yard knockback. The basilisk will often lunge forwards (moving as part of the attack, in this case, not being limited to &quot;directly towards&quot; the target) before using this, allowing it to catch people who were directly to its sides.\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe basilisk is a fairly simple creature, showing up and causing havoc; it's intelligent, but without complex desires. It requires little of its summoner, but its gaze is as liable to destroy its summoner as it is their enemies.\n\nThere is one condition that can be troublesome. If the basilisk is present when a fight ends (it cannot be dismissed after one side has surrendered or stood down, or the last blow has been dealt), it will not be possible to de-summon the creatures until it's had the opportunity to consume the flesh of its foes, preferring the living-but-injured over the dead (and it will eat corpses of allies as well). The basilisk will only leave after eating 2d10 people, or running out of appropriate food. It won't eat anyone who is alive and also never injured it during battle. Anyone who tries to stop it, including the summoner, will become next on the menu.\n\nRemoving the bodies also counts as trying to stop it. Doing this, in addition to causing the basilisk to try to eat the offending party, constitutes breach of contract if the summoner is involved in it or fails to help the basilisk drive off whoever's interfering.\n</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Ibuse\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nIbuse is an enormous purple-grey beast, large enough to swallow a small house between its jaws. He has a pair of small, dark, beady eyes that often go unnoticed, and his skin is always slightly moist. His thick, damp hide has an almost flabby texture.\n\nWhat's particularly unusual about Ibuse is that he is, so to say, 'unique'--in the same sense that there is only one avatar for any given contract, there is only one Ibuse; it's a name, not a title or a description. Additionally, of all the salamander summons he is the least bestial in outlook, demonstrating genuine good will towards his summoner, and even growing attached to those who call on him frequently (without abusing that good will).\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nIbuse is far more agreeable than other salamanders, doing his best to follow the summoner's orders to the letter. Unlike other salamanders he will actually form a bond with its summoners, though he still can't communicate... and given the standoffish nature of salamanders as a whole, this means that Ibuse is agreeable and willingly helpful, not actually 'friendly' by most standards.\n\nUnfortunately, he's still a large, clumsy beast, and still incapable of speech. Furthermore, his main method of attack is fairly uncontrollable, meaning that there's actually very little Ibuse can do to avoid inadvertently harming a summoner who isn't sufficiently prepared.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 2400\n\n<br> STR: 100\n<br> RES: 100\n<br> CHA: 100\n<br> DEX: 100\n<br> AGI: 100\n\n<br> Accuracy: 45\n<br> Dodge: +30\n<br> Damage Bonus: 11.5\n\n<br> Athletics: +20\n<br> Awareness: +25\n<br> Resistance: +20\n<br> Stealth: +30\n<br> Toxicology: +35\n\n<br> Stamina: +15\n<br> Chakra Exhaustion: +15\n\n\n###### Amphibian\nIbuse takes only 25% damage from Suiton techniques; any techniques or advanced elemental natures incorporating Suiton deal only 50% damage.\n\n###### Spongey\nIbuse has very slippery skin, as well as pourous, spongy flesh. Blunt attacks deal only 25% damage, Piercing attacks do only 50% damage, and Katon does 75% damage (though advanced natures using it still deal full damage). He is immune to Burns and Ignite. He cannot be grappled, even by summons prodigiously large enough to accomplish that feat.\n\n###### Huge\nIbuse cannot dodge area-of-effect attacks; instead, he automatically blocks them as a Speed 0 defense. Ibuse cannot hide (via stealth) due to being enormous. He cannot be knocked airborne, and any knockback effects have their efficacy reduced by half.\n\n###### Thick Skin\nIbuse has a Damage Reduction of 100.\n\n###### Tireless\nIbuse does not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when it act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +15 to their rolls.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nIbuse may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n\n###### Block (Speed 4, 2 AP)\nIbuse may use Block as a Speed 4 Interrupt, even when he hasn't declared that he's blocking for a period of time.\n\n###### Burrow (Speed 10, 5 AP)\nIbuse dives underground, making a Stealth roll with a +10 bonus. From there, Ibuse can move underground, covering 3 yards every IC spent moving; area-of-effect techniques can't damage him at this point. Once he's been located, an attack dealing at least 500 base damage will break through to the depth he's at, ending this technique; he'll automatically block the technique used against him this way.\n\\page\n\n###### Smash (Speed 12, 5 AP)\nUsing his mass, Ibuse aims to stomp a target, slap his tail down on them, or attack in a similar fashion. This is treated as a basic unarmed melee attack with a range of 15 yards, dealing 10d12 Blunt damage and inflicting a Stun 6 if its victim is wounded by the attack.\n\n###### Swallow Whole (Speed 8, 10 AP)\nIf underground and within 5 yards of an enemy, Ibuse can be commanded to try to swallow them. This counts as a Area 10 attack, and if it hits, the enemy is swallowed up and trapped inside Ibuse's stomach. While inside, the enemy is subject to stomach acid that inflicts a Poison 10 status as long as they are trapped inside. An enemy traped inside Ibuse can try to force their way out, damaging the stomach as a target that can't defend itself but with all actions they take having their normal Speed doubled (which does not increase their damage). Once at least 1000 damage has been dealt to the inside of Ibuse's stomach, anyone alive inside has broken out and can escape. After someone has escaped from Ibuse's stomach this way, Swallow Whole cannot be used for the remainder of the battle. This damage is not actually dealt to Ibuse's Vitality.\n \n###### Poison Mist (Speed 20, 10 AP, Chakra 25)\nIbuse opens his mouth and exhales a cloud of powerful, paralytic poison, in the form of a frothing purple mist. Everyone in a 100 yard radius of Ibuse has to make a Resistance roll against Ibuse's toxicology, or be poisoned. Whenever someone enters the cloud, and every 10 IC they spend in it, they also need to make a Resistance roll. The cloud itself lingers for 30 IC, after which time it disperses. Ibuse can only store so much poison at once, and it takes a while for the chemical reactions that prime it inside his body to take place; once this ability is used, Ibuse can't utilize it again for another 100 IC.\n\n###### Paralytic Poison\n###### Poison: 8\n###### Paralyze: 5\n###### Duration: 50\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nIbuse is a very kind and caring summon, for a Salamander. So kind in fact, that Ibuse doesn't even get mad if the summoner includes Ibuse in area of effect attacks. Ibuse just takes the hits and keeps on following the summoner's orders.\n\nIn other words, catching Ibuse in the crossfire of the summoner's attacks will not constitute a breach of contract.</text> \\page\n\n## Summon Avatar: Ka Rui\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nThe beast known as Ka Riu is literally legendary--and according to the legends, is a dragon made entirely of living flames, a literal force of nature. While very few shinobi have seen the Salamander Avatar, the general opinion is that they simply share a name. It's probably not actually an immortal, primal incarnation of fire.\n\nIt does, however, very definitely breathe fire, and there are certainly people who claim that it can, and does, fly. Considering how little information salamanders generally share about themselves, the avatar probably just 'inherited' the mythical dragon's name due to similarities (flying, breathing fire, being phenomenally powerful, those things).\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nIn Ka Riu's eyes, all are equal. It torches anything and everything in the vicinity where it's summoned. About the best a summoner can hope for is that the resulting devastaion will be more damaging to their enemies than themselves or their allies.\n\nIt will accept its summoner's requests for where it should direct its flames, but will plainly ignore any requests about trying to avoid certain individuals or minimize collateral damage. Anyone foolish enough to personally attract the &quot;dragon's&quot; attention by injuring it will similarly have themselves, and their surroundings, bathed in flames.</text>\n\\page\n## Slug Contract\nSlugs are a rarely-seen contract for several reasons. The first, their temperament doesn't lend itself well to the shinobi lifestyle; while they aren't pacifists, they're kind-hearted creatures that feel violence should be used only after all other reasonable options have been exhausted. The second, they don't tend towards spectacular displays of violence and power, which are things virtually all shinobi love. And finally, they're slugs. Seriously, who wants to brag that they can summon giant slugs into battle?\n\nAll that aside, the slugs themselves tend to be wary of most summoners' intentions at first. Once they're convinced that the person summoning them is similarly kind-hearted (which is not, by any means, the same thing as &quot;unwilling to fight&quot; or &quot;unassertive&quot;--though it may in some cases go hand-in-hand with those two) they become some of the friendliest summons, not concerned with relative status or power like animals of some others species.\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n<br> 1000 XP: Slug Slime\n<br> 1500 XP: Summon: Leech Swarm\n<br> 2000 XP: Medicinal Leeches\n<br> 2500 XP: Summon: Slug Swarm\n<br> 3000 XP: Acid Shot\n<br> 3500 XP: Snail Shell Sanctum\n<br> 4000 XP: Summon: Rock Snail\n<br> 4500 XP: Slug Body\n<br> 5000 XP: Summon: Katsuyu</text>\n## Techniques\n### --( Neba no Namakuji - Slug Slime )--\nThe summoner secretes a thin layer of clear, slightly glossy liquid from their pores, covering their body with it. Despite being criticized as a 'gross' technique, most users agree that it's really not that bad, and just feels like being slightly wet, like having recently come out of a shower. Then again, they summon slugs, so it's questionable how reliable they are to begin with.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed:  10\n  -  Seal Speed: 10\n\nEffects:\nAll offensive grapple rolls involving you, including ones to remain in control of a grapple, have a -X penalty; it does not matter whether you are making them, or the other person in the grapple. Similarly, any Immobilization penalties you suffer from for reasons other than poison are reduced by 2.\n\nWhile not particularly dangerous to living tissue (which is good, since the user is covered in it), this slime is highly corrosive to certain other materials. Any time a weapon strikes you, its damage dice are reduced by 1; when they reach 0, the weapon is useless and breaks the next time it's used to attack anything.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Yakuyou Hiru - Summoning: Medicinal Leeches )--\nYou summon a number of large leeches, which adhere to either your skin or that of someone willing to have half a dozen giant leeches sucking their blood (a rather small portion of the poulation). These leeches perform two functions: the first, they return some of the extracted blood to the host, but do so after filtering it, cleansing the recipient's system of toxins. Additionally, they convert some of the drained blood into chakra, which the person covered in leeches is able to draw on in order to rejuvenate themselves.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15+X\n  -  Range: Touch\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nEffects:\nA number of leeches appear on you and begin draining your blood. You acquire a Bleed X status, which does not decrease so long as this techniques is maintained. However, you receive a +X/2 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina rolls. The Bleed status from this effect of Medicinal Leeches does not impose a Stamina penalty. X has a maximum of double your ninjutsu damage bonus.\n\nSo long as this technique is in place, more leeches will automatically be summoned if you are poisoned. If you are suffering from a poison, you suffer a Bleed Y, with Y being equal to the severity of the Poison status itself; they persist until the poison is cured (either by reaching its normal duration, or through other means, such as an antidote), and then unsummon themselves. While this is in place, you suffer no detrimental effects from the poison, though this Bleed status does impose its normal Stamina penalty.\n\nYou may apply this to another person only if they are willing or helpless. You, or the recipient, may end the technique at will. The two possible Bleed effects from Medicinal Leeches (one to improve your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion, and one to negate poisons) are considered different sources of Bleed.\n\n\\page\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kakusan Satsusei - Acid Shot )--\nMuch as it would suggest, you spit out a high-velocity ball of acid at a victim. Contrary to popular beliefs, and all overused jokes aside, this actually leaves the ninja using it with incredibly clean teeth and minty fresh breath.\n\n  -  Chakra: 15 + X * 2\n  -  Damage: (2+2*X)d12\n  -  Range: 15\n  -  Speed: 8\n\nEffects:\nUnlike other summon techniques, you may use this any number of times within a single battle. X is the number of times it has already been used in that battle; thus, the third time you used it, it would have a Chakra cost of (15+2*2) = 19. In addition to its listed damage, each hit also applies Acid 5 (described below) to its target. The damage, and severity of this satus effect, are reduced by partial defense normally. Acid Shot deals Energy damage.\n\n   Acid (Status Effect)\nYou have acid on you, eating away at your body! There's not much to be done about it, and it's more painful than dangerous. Not to say that it isn't dangerous--chemical burns suck like that. Whenever you take damage from something capable of inflicting wounds, its damage is considered (X*5) points higher for the purposes of determining whether or not you're wounded, and what severity the wound is, where X is the severity of your Acid status. Acid stacks with itself; two Acid 5 hits become Acid 10. This increase is applied after all other alterations to damage, including blocking, DR, and percent-based increases (or decreases) in effective damage for dealing wounds.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Katatsumari Butsuden - Summoning: Snail Shell Sanctum  )--\nYou summon the entrance to an enormous snail's shell (the entrance well over ten feet around), which generates a vortex that sucks anyone nearby into it! Because it's actually possible for even an untrained human to resist the pull for the few seconds its takes for the shell's entrance to disappear again, this technique is mostly used when keeping someone safe from collateral damage is of paramount importance.\n\n  -  Chakra: 27\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Area: 2\n  -  Speed: 18\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n\nEffects:\nThis can target any number of people within its area, but they all must be willing or helpless. They're transported to the inside of the inside of the snail's shell. There's enough air to breathe indefinitely, and fit a few dozen people comfortably (far more than could realistically be fit into the technique's target area).\n\nThe technique persists until the user ends it, or someone breaks a hole in the shell from the inside (requiring a total of 2000 non-Piercing damage to be done to it). In the former case, everyone appears within 10 yards of them, or the nearest safe terrain. In the latter, the snail shell itself appears there, complete with gaping hole in the side; it vanishes several seconds later, leaving the passengers behind.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Karada o Kyouda - Slug Body )--\nNot really a summoning in the proper sense, the user causes their body to take on the spongey quality of a slug's. In addition to their skin feeling rubbery, their muscle fibers and bones become slightly elastic. The effect isn't extreme enough to allow things like squeezing through doorways, or prevent normal combat, but does soften blows relying on the application of brute force, and the user's rubbery body becomes more prone to being pushed aside by dangerous injuries rather than giving way.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 22\n\nEffects:\nYou reduce all Blunt damage by 25%, and stuns caused by attacks inflicting Blunt damage are halved. Additionally, attacks which deal damage types other than Energy do not benefit from effects which increase their damage for the purposes of wounding when used against you.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Leech Swarm\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nLeeches are nasty little bloodsucking things, their rare and dubious medicinal purposes aside. Nobody likes leeches; then again, nobody likes slugs, either. While these summoned leeches are oversized, they aren't absurdly so; a single leech could probably fit on an average shinobi's palm with some difficulty.\n\nOf course, this doesn't summon a single leech. It summons dozens, if not hundreds, of them.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + Special (see &quot;Swarm&quot; under Attributes)\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 16\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nWhen it comes to following orders, the leeches have something approaching human-level intelligence. They can't communicate, sadly (or perhaps thankfully), but can be directed to prioritize specific opponents or lie in wait in a trap.\n\nIn combat, they tend to swarm a single target and adhere to them, at which point they begin consuming the victim's blood.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\nVitality: 150\n\nMovement: 1.0 yards per IC\n\n\n###### Anesthetize\nAs is the case with many leeches, these ones suck blood! And, when they do so, they secrete a mild anesthetic that prevents the bite from hurting. Except these are ninja leeches, so everything's more extreme! Someone affected by the leech swarm's Hemophagy ability reduces the distance they can move in 1 IC by 0.1 per point of Bleed status caused by that ability.\n\n###### Horde\nThe leech swarm takes only 1/4 damage from single-target attacks, and is immune to genjutsu. Area-of-effect techniques do full damage. They're also immune to status effects other than area-of-effect Immobilization, all single-target non-damaging effects (such as Trip), and grapples. Finally, they treat the severity of AoE Immobilization effects afflicting them as being 6 lower.\n\n###### Revitalization\nKeep track of all the damage done by the Bleed status caused by the leech swarm's Hemophagy ability. When the swarm is unsummoned for any reason other than a breach of contract, the summoner is healed for that much. This healing will first fill their HP, then begin restoring lost Vitality. It will not, however, take them above their maximum Vitality.\n\n###### Swarm\nFor combat purposes the swarm is treated as a single entity, its Vitality total representing the amount of damage that needs to be done before the leeches all unsummon at once. Additionally, by using more chakra in the summoning, more leeches can be summoned. A maximum of (XP)/200 can be added to the Chakra cost. Every +1 Chakra cost gives the swarm +30 Vitality and +0.1 yards per IC movement speed.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\nStandard Actions\nThe leech swarm may use the Move action as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n\n###### Hemophagy (Speed 8, 10 AP)\nThis attack only be used when the leeches are at 0 yards range from the target, and have been there for at least 5 IC. Leeches crawl up onto the victim's body and begin draining their blood! The target acquires a Bleed status that starts at Severity 1 and increases by 1 every IC until they've moved at least 5 yards away. This Bleed has a maximum severity of (the swarm's maximum Vitality)/50. If the swarm catches up to an unfortunate victim again, another activation of Hemophagy will cause it to resume increasing the Bleed's severity.\n\nThis Bleed status does not decrease normally, and ignores effects that prevent, remove, or reduce the severity of the Bleed status effect. There are two ways to get rid of it! The first, every 50 damage the victim takes from area-of-effect attacks, before reductions are applied, will reduce the Bleed by 1. Secondly, the swarm leaving the battlefield will cause the Bleed to end immediately.\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nKnowingly ordering the leeches to attack civilians constitutes a breach of contract, as does attempting to use them to torture captives.</text>\n\\page\n\n\n## Summon: Slug Swarm\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nSlugs are the center of the contract and they work well as a team. They have a powerful acid a when they swarm together they are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nOf course, this doesn't summon a single slug. It summons dozens, if not hundreds, of them.\n\n  -  Chakra: 14 + Special (see &quot;Swarm&quot; under Attributes)\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Seal Speed: 17\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nWhen it comes to following orders, the slugs have something approaching human-level intelligence. They can communicate simple motions by a team effort of motioning around themselves.\n\nIn combat, they tend to swarm a single target and adhere to them, at which point they begin melt them down.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\nVitality: 150\n\nMovement: 1.0 yards per IC\n\n###### Burning Bodies\nThe slugs are coated with the same kind of acid they spit out and it burns! Anyone who attacks the slugs with a melee unarmed attack gets a little bit of the acid on their skin! This inflicts an acid two effect as described in the Technique Acid Shot.\n\n###### Horde\nThe slug swarm takes only 1/4 damage from single-target attacks, and is immune to genjutsu. Area-of-effect techniques do full damage. They're also immune to status effects other than area-of-effect Immobilization, all single-target non-damaging effects (such as Trip), and grapples. Finally, they treat the severity of AoE Immobilization effects afflicting them as being 6 lower.\n\n###### Burrow\nUsing their acid the swarm of slugs can burrow slowly through objects. This counts as using the C-rank Moving Underground As If Swimming but leaving it open long enough that one person can travel through it besides them.\n\n###### Swarm\nFor combat purposes the swarm is treated as a single entity, its Vitality total representing the amount of damage that needs to be done before the slugss all unsummon at once. Additionally, by using more chakra in the summoning, more slugs can be summoned. A maximum of (XP)/200 can be added to the Chakra cost. Every +1 Chakra cost gives the swarm +30 Vitality and +0.1 yards per IC movement speed.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nThe slug swarm may use the Move action as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n\n###### Acid Shot (Speed 8, Range 15, 10 AP)\nThe slugs may all together fire their acid at a target. This uses the Technique Acid Shot from the slugs.\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nKnowingly ordering the slugs to attack civilians constitutes a breach of contract, as does attempting to use them to torture captives.\n\\page\n\n## Summon: The Rock Snail\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nOnly found in the deepest and widest caves, this snail seems to be the thing that carves the passages itself. It pushes it's way through whole mountains and creates a labyrinth of caverns. Deep in the center is it's home. A sentient creature, it can't exactly speak but can feel it's summoner's mind and communicate with them through a telepathic link. Naturally it is a gentle creature but when summoned it can be a force to be reckoned with, mostly because of it's size.\n\nIt's towers over two story buildings and can basically move through them, it's mighty shell being a dark, nearly metallic brown color and etched like the rocks in the mountains it breaks through. Gemstones and geodes poke out from the different parts of it as they've been ground into it's corners, a shimmering shell showing such splendor.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nThe Rock Snail has a bit of a personality to it, it will help the user but will not go into salt water, nor will it go through fire. Despite it's immense size it has simple fears.\n\nIn combat its preferred tactic is to mentally stun it's enemies, charge any the ones it can and crush them. If it becomes the focus of attacks that actually begin to hurt it, it will withdraw into it's shell. If someone ignites it, it will stay withdrawn until the ignite goes away.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 3200\n\n<br> STR: 100\n<br> RES: 200\n<br> CHA: 90\n<br> DEX: 90\n<br> AGI: 30\n\n<br> Accuracy: 32\n<br> Dodge: +0\n<br> Damage Bonus: 12.0\n<br> Genjutsu: +25\n\n<br> Stamina: +25\n<br> Chakra Exhaustion: +25\n\n<br> Athletics: +10\n<br> Awareness: +10\n<br> Resistance: +50\n<BR>\n\n###### Titanic\nThe Rock Snail cannot dodge area-of-effect attacks; instead, they automatically block them as a Speed 0 defense. The Rock Snail cannot hide. Multi-throws inflict half damage to The Rock Snail. The Rock Snail is too large to be affected by any jutsu or effects that work by binding or physically immobilizing them. They cannot be grappled by any enemies who are not Huge or larger.\n\nThe Rock Snail cannot dodge any attack\n\nAttempting to parry the Rock Snail's attacks requires either a Strength of 80 or more, or an unarmed physical damage bonus of 10 or greater, as well as both hands free. It can also make it's attacks at a range of 15.\n\n###### Tireless\nThe Rock Snail does not need to make Stamina rolls for its actions. If forced to for other reasons (such as Suffocation), it uses +25 for its effective bonus to Fatigue rolls.\n\n###### Bestial\nThe Rock Snail isn't driven by higher desires like many other summons (and ninja), as a result it cannot be bribed or reasoned with. It has a +10 bonus to its defenses aginst any form of genjutsu.\n\n###### Slimy Exterior\nWhen you roll to hit this creature with a taijutsu attack (Ranged OR Melee) you have to roll 2d20 and take the lowest one for your attack.\n\n###### Gooey Center\nBasilisks have a Damage Reduction of 40.\n\n###### Telepathic Bond\nThe Rock Snail cannot talk but can feel the mind of the summoner. This way it can still communicate and will stay in contact with you at any distance after being summoned until dismissed. This allows you to give commands without breaking Stealth\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions (Speed as normal)\nThe Rock Snail may use Move and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n###### Mental Blast (Range 40, Speed 8, 10 AP)\nThe Rock Snail has an incredibly powerful mind for a creature that seems huge and lumbering, it can \nreach into the minds of ninja and disorient them. This isn't an exceptionally powerful technique but using the Snail's genjutsu roll you make an attack that if successful inflicts the target with a Stun 10. This has a -2 to it's attack every time you use it on the same target in a combat, cumulatively, but each time it's successful on the same target the Stun becomes 5 higher (Stun 15, Stun 20, etc.)\n\n###### Withdraw (Speed 4, 5 AP)\nThis action can be used to bring the Rock Snail's head into it's shell. It's Awareness rolls gain -10 and it triples it's damage reduction. It can still attack but cannot move and if it uses Lurching Crush, Withdraw ends and Lurching Crush's line attack is doubled in length. Otherwise you can end Withdraw by using this action again.\n\n###### Lurching Crush (Delay 5,Speed 15, 12 AP)\nThe Rock Snail dives forward as fast as it's slimy underside can carry it. Making a rampaging charge, the Snail crushes anything that gets in it's path. It runs in a 20 yard straight line, that is 7 yards wide, dealing 6d20 damage to anything it goes over. If the terrain it moves through is rocky then it gains 5 DR every time it uses this.\n\n###### Like a Rock (Variable)\nBeing almost a part of the mountains, the snail can use all E-rank, D-rank, and C-rank Doton Techniques. It cannot wield a weapon.\n\n\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nThe Rock Snail is slightly a coward and will keep itself away from some situations, but it will never abandon you until you dismiss it. It is a loyal creature and feel that if you summon it you really need it's aid. It still cannot be convinced to go into saltwater or to go through fire.\n\n</text>\n\\page\n## Summon Avatar: Katsuya\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n\n====================\n1.

Behavior\n------------------------------\n\n\\page\n\n## Snake Contract\nSnakes are one of the most maligned summoning creatures. They are not, however, misunderstood in the least. Snakes aren't so much actively malevolent or subversive as they are disdainful of all other creatures (and even some of their own kind). They're quite honest on the matter, too; while the weaker summons at least won't be openly disrespectful, the more powerful they become the more likely they are to berate and insult their summoner.\n\nThe current avatar-class summon of the snake contract is unknown. A hundred years ago it was Manda, a tremendous cobra who is said to have died in the Fourth Great Shinobi War. Since then, nobody has mastered the contract to the level necessary to summon the current avatar...\n\n...Or if they have, they just got eaten.\n\nSnakes do that, as it turns out.\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n<br> 1000 XP: Hidden Shadow Snake Hands\n<br> 1500 XP: Vanishing Python Technique\n<br> 2000 XP: Summon: Cobra\n<br> 2250 XP: Many Hidden Shadow Snake Hands\n<br> 2500 XP: Suicide Shedding\n<br> 3000 XP: Summon: Hydra\n<br> 4000 XP: Superior Suicide Shedding\n<br> ?????

You summon up to three snakes which appear coiled around one of your arms and leap from your sleeves to strike at an opponent.\n\nIt's much more visually impressive if they seem to leap out of nowhere beneath the sleeves of your shirt, coat, or similar garment.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + (Variable)\n  -  Damage: (Total Chakra cost /4)d12\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Speed: 12\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nYou may use this technique twice per day; the first time it's used in a given combat, it's an automatic Sneak Attack. In future uses, it's an automatic Surprise Attack. The damage dealt by Hidden Snake Hands inflicts Piercing wounds.\n\nThe effects of Sen'eijashu are variable: you choose which varieties of snakes to summon, and modify its Chakra cost, damage, and effects accordingly. By default, you summon zero snakes; you may summon up to three, applying the Chakra modifiers for each snake chosen.\n\nThese snakes inflict multiple status effects; all of these effects are caused by that specific poison, and if it's cured they go away with it. Unless otherwise specified in the individual descriptions, there is no benefit to summoning multiples of the same venomous snake (their effects and bonuses do not stack; Python and Black Adder are exceptions).\n\nIf you hit, make a single Toxicology skill roll using your XP/200 in place of your Toxicology skill ranks, opposed by your opponent's standard Resistance. An opponent who fails is poisoned by every snake you used (but please review the rules in Status and Conditions -&gt; Poison before using this technique). Without further ado, the snakes:\n\n\n######   a. Black Adder (Chakra +5)\nYour Toxicology roll with Sen'eijashu has a +3 bonus for each Black Adder summoned.\n   Poison 1, Duration 100\n\n\n######     b. Black Mamba (Chakra +5)\nThis technique begins with Suffocation 0. Every 25 IC, the Suffocation status increases by 1 (provoking a Stamina 15 roll, as is normal for Suffocation, from the victim). This suffocation penalty begins decreasing only after the poison is cured or has expired (i.e. the end of its Duration)\n   Poison 2, Duration 250, Suffocation (Special)\n\n\n######     c. Blue Krait (Chakra +10)\nYour victim suffers an Immobilize with a severity equal to the total of all Poison statuses they're suffering from.\n   Poison 2, Immobilize (Special), Duration 150\n\n\n######     d. King Cobra (+10)\nFor the duration of the poison, the victim has a -4 penalty to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and a -4 penalty to all their non-Resistance skill rolls.\n   Poison 2, Paralysis 3, Duration 200\n\n\n######     e. Pit Viper (Chakra +10)\nFor the poison's duration, any Bleed effects on the victim will not decrease naturally.\n   Poison 1, Bleed 3, Duration 200\n\n\n######     f. Puff Adder (Chakra +10)\nThe puff adder's venom has the unusual, and fairly terrifying, effect of causing widespread cellular death near the site of the bite. If the victim is poisoned, roll for location (unless a wound was inflicted using Sen'eijashu, in which case use that location), for a Piercing wound. 50 IC after being poisoned, the victim suffers a Minor wound on that location. 100 IC later, they suffer a Major wound; another 100 IC later, they suffer a Severe wound.\n   Poison 1, Duration 250\n\\page\n\n\n######     g. Python (Chakra +5)\nThis snake has no venom. Instead, your various summoned snakes bite into the opponent and don't release them (or disappear immediately after attacking, as the snakes created by this technique normally do). The opponent cannot move beyond Sen'eijashu's range from you, and you may, as a Speed 10 or Speed +5 (when used alongside a melee-range attack) action reel them in, instantly bringing them into melee range with you.\n   Check for location if this hits (or use the location of the wound inflicted by Sen'eijashu, if any); if it's a leg or an arm, that limb is in a Leg or Arm Lock, as appropriate, as per the D-rank Grapple Taijutsu. A person bitten by the snakes may attempt to escape via the Break Grapple (but not Escape Grapple) action, which is raised to Speed 6; you do not have to make a Stamina roll when someone is struggling free, and use your CHA in place of your STR (as the &quot;attacker&quot;). Each python summoned beyond the first gives you a +5 bonus to your &quot;grapple&quot; rolls.\n\n\n######     h. Taipan (Chakra +5)\nSen'eijashu has a +2 Accuracy bonus. You may make Sen'eijashu a Called Shot, with no Accuracy penalty.\n   Poison 4, Duration 50\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n### --( Sen'ei Tajashu - Many Hidden Shadow Snake Hands )--\nAn advanced version of Sen'eijashu, this summons a huge quantity of snakes, usually on the order of dozens, which will intimidate, divert, and attack their opponents.\n\n  -  Chakra: +5 per additional target\n  -  Accuracy: +2\n  -  Range: 25\n  -  Speed: 16\n  -  Requires: Sen'eijashu\n\nEffects:\nThis is essentially an upgraded version of Sen'eijashu, with increased range and Speed. As noted, you may further increase Sen'eijashu's Chakra cost to target any number of additional people within range with your snakes.\n\nOtherwise, all effects (base Chakra cost, costs to add snakes, number of snakes that may attack any given target) are the same as Sen'eijashu. Each target is attacked with every variety of snake you paid for.\n\nHowever, this is still considered a separate technique from Sen'eijashu.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n### --( Uwabami no Shoushitsu no Jutsu - Vanishing Python Technique )--\nA technique many users of the snake-summoning contract are hesitant to use, mostly because it involves getting swallowed by a type of animal known to have absolutely no compunctions about eating their masters. Nonetheless, the snakes ensure their summoners that stories of fatalities resulting from this technique are entirely fabricated. Maybe. Only one way to find out.\n\nThe head of a giant python rises up from the ground (without causing any damage to it, even! how convenient) and either opens its mouth allowing the user to step in, or just snaps its jaw shut and swallows them before retreating back into the morass of chakra from which it came, and vanishing as if it had never been there.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20 + X * 2 + Y * 5\n  -  Range: 10\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 24\n  -  Requires: Kuchiyose no Jutsu\n\nEffects:\nOh my god two variables in the chakra cost it's algebra all over again.\n\nY is the number of &quot;passengers&quot;, people other than the user. If they are willing or unable to resist, it's a simple matter of them entering the mouth. If they try to avoid it, the snake swallowing them has only Accuracy 20. All passengers must be within 10 yards of each other when the snake is summoned.\n\nX hours later, the snake's head will reappear within 50 yards of the location it was summoned at and its mouth will open, allowing passengers to leave (or just spitting them out, if they don't). To the passengers, it will seem as though no time at all has passed. For all intents and purposes, they did not exist for the past however-many hours. Attempts to reach them, communicate with them, or forcibly end this technique early will all fail. If the area they disappeared in is no longer safe, the snake will instead deposit them on the nearest solid ground.\n\nX has a maximum of (summoner's total XP)/100, and a minimum of 1.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Kaikou Jisatsu Youshiki - Summoning: Suicide Shedding Style )--\nYou summon a giant, forty-or-more foot long snake which coils itself around you in the blink of an eye, forming a protective living barrier of sorts. By the time an enemy's attack actually arrives the snake has already shed its skin and returned to wherever it came from, leaving the discarded skin to crumble shortly afterwards\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Special: Interrupt\n  -  Speed: 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nThis protects everyone within 5 yards of you from whatever attack it is used to interrupt. All damage and secondary effects which require you to have been hit are negated. Suicide Shedding may only be used against attacks used from more than 5 yards away.\n\nHowever, this summon may not be used again for (damage of the attack it was used to stop)/100 weeks (OOC days), with a minimum of 1.\n\\page\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Superior Suicide Shedding )--\nThe delay before you can use Suicide Shedding again is reduced to (damage of the attack it was used to stop)/200 weeks (OOC days), still with a minimum of 1. This is a permanent, passive upgrade to Suicide Shedding, not a separate technique.</text>\n\n\n\\page\n## Summon Cobra\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nA large purple cobra, with a body a bit over a foot and a half in diameter, and well over thirty feet in total length. The upper side of its body is dark purple, and its underbelly (along with the inside of its hood) a pale, striated purple-gray.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\nThey look kind of like this:\nhttp://i41.tinypic.com/2pyw0zk.jpg\nBut somewhat less adorable.\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nThe cobras can talk, and they totally don't hiss their S-es. Well, some do, others don't; it varies from one to the other. Some summoners find themselves summoning the same cobra time and again, while others call a different one each time. The common theory is that this is the snakes just screwing with people (though they resent any such accusations).\n\nCobras are highly critical of their summoners, in a smug fashion, but will ultimately still fulfill their summoner's requests.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 600\n\n<br> STR: 60\n<br> RES: 70\n<br> CHA: 90\n<br> DEX: 80\n<br> SPD: 80\n\n<br> Accuracy: 32\n<br> Dodge: +26\n<br> Genjutsu: +20\n<br> Damage Bonus: 6.0\n<br> Movement: 2 yards per IC\n\n<br> Athletics: +10\n<br> Awareness: +30\n<br> Resistance: +15\n<br> Stealth: +25\n<br> Survival: +20\n<br> Toxicology: +20\n\n<br> Chakra Exhaustion: +15\n<BR>\n\n###### Enhanced Smell\nThe cobra halves visibility penalties to its Awareness rolls and Accuracy.\n\n###### Hypnotic Gaze\nThe cobra must be able to make eye contact to use any of its Serpent Illusion abilities. As such, they can be avoided by someone who shuts their uses. Never looking directly at the cobra works... sort of. This afflicts them with an effective -4 visibility penalty, but snakes are highly agile, and able to move in ways people wouldn't expect. This doesn't confer immunity to its genjutsu, but does give a +10 bonus to any defensive rolls against it.\n\n###### Sly Mind\nCobras have a +5 bonus to their defensive rolls against genjutsu, raised to +10 for rolls to see through already-in-place static genjutsu. Anyone who fails to affect one with a genjutsu must immediately defend against one of the cobra's Serpentine Illusions (at the summoner's choice) with a -5 penalty, with the cobra paying no cost (in Speed or Chakra) for this.\n\n###### Snake\nBecause they are snakes, cobras cannot be tripped. Any immobilization penalties are reduced by 5, and any reductions in movement speed from other sources are halved.\n\n###### Venom\nAs might be expected, cobras are venomous. Certain of their attacks have a chance to poison their enemies, as will be described in Abilities. It has the following statistics.\n<br>    Emperor Cobra Venom (Injury, Ingestion, Contact, Inhalation)\n<br>    Poison: 4\n<br>    Paralysis: 2\n<br>    Duration: 250\n<br>    Toxicology: 25 (to be used by a human)\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nCobras may use Dodge, Move, Block, and Parry (unarmed only) as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP.\n\n\n\n###### Bite (Speed 10, 8 AP)\nThe cobra bites someone! This does 5d6 damage. If partial defense does not apply, the opponent must also defend against the cobra's venom, with the cobra receiving a +5 bonus to its Toxicology roll.\n\n\\page\n\n###### Constrict (Speed 14, 6 AP)\nA cobra can grab someone and wrap them in its tail. This is treated as a grapple, but the cobra suffers none of the normal penalties for being in a grapple; however, it cannot move while holding someone this way. Every 10 IC, the person being constricted suffers a Suffocation 1 and takes 5*(cobra's damage bonus) damage. The cobra has a +5 bonus to its rolls to maintain the grapple. Escape Grapple cannot be used to escape from a cobra's coils. If the cobra chooses to Bite the person it's constricting, their defense has a -6 penalty.\n\n\n###### Devour Illusion (Speed 15, 5 AP, Chakra 20)\nWhen confronted with a genjutsu, cobras can siphon the chakra sustaining it out of the air and &quot;eat&quot; it. This works against area-of-effect genjutsu as well as genjutsu affecting individuals, though in the latter case whoever has the genjutsu on them broken also advances 1 Fatigue level. This may only be used on willing individuals.\n\n\n###### Serpentine Illusion: Bottomless Abyss (Speed 15, 10 AP, Chakra 30)\nAn illusion which plays on two of the most primal, instinctive human fears: falling, and darkness. The victim of this technique feels as if they're falling down a dark, bottomless pit, the terror rising as they anticipate the inevitable impact at the bottom.\n\nIt never comes, of course--but the illusion is enough to leave people reeling.\n\nIf this technique hits, it inflicts a Stun 10 + 5 * X, where X is the number of Willpower the victim is missing. Someone with 6 maximum willpower who had 4 remaining, thus, suffer a Stun 20. If they are missing at least half of their maximum Willpower (thus, someone with 3 out of 6 WP left would be affected, but not someone with 4 out of 7), they also advance a Fatigue category.\n\nHowever, for every time someone has been affected by Bottomless Abyss they have a +10 bonus to future defenses against it in that battle.\n\n\n###### Serpentine Illusion: Coiling Horror (Speed 10, 10 AP, Chakra 15 + 5 * X)\nThis is a genjutsu which targets up to X people. Those affected are placed in a trance-like state and unable to take any actions whatsoever (with their IC advancing normally) so long as this jutsu lasts; while it does, the cobra may not break eye contact or take other actions.\n\nAnyone held this way may make another genjutsu roll every 50 IC, against the cobra's original result, with a cumulative +2 bonus. They also break free automatically if they are the target of any attack. However! This only applies to attacks from which they can feel genuine malice (&quot;killing intent&quot;, in shinobi terms)--a friend punching them to try to free them will, unfortunately, not free them from the illusion. Anyone trapped by this technique may spent a point of Willpower at any time to make another roll, with a +5 bonus (which is added to their cumulative bonus for future rolls as well).\n\nAgainst anyone with 2 or fewer maximum Willpower (which includes virtually all non-shinobi), the cobra does not need to maintain eye contact to maintain the hypnotism, and can in fact mentally give the victims any sort of non-combat commands (such as &quot;go wander out of town instead of guarding this building&quot;). Against non-shinobi, suicide is a valid command. (Certain exceptionally strong-willed individuals may be able to resist that--but this is a very, very small percent of the population).\n\n\n###### Serpentine Illusion: Spiral Grave (Speed 25, 25 AP, Chakra 40)\nThis jutsu drives its victims slowly, if temporarily, insane. It begins with a sense of impending doom, moving on to cold sweat and steadily-mounting anxiety, then ringing noises and flickers of motion at the edge of one's field of view, then difficulty breathing--and, finally, the body begins simply shutting down.\n\nHowever, so long as this technique is in effect the victim knows the direction and distance of the cobra who placed it upon them; it's impossible for the cobra to hide from that person.\n\nEvery 10 IC, the victim suffers a Suffocation 1, loses 5% of their maximum Vitality (or HP if they have run out of Vitality), and suffers a cumulative -1 penalty to defend against genjutsu. This will continue indefinitely until the victim falls unconscious or the cobra is unsummoned (due to taking too much damage, or for any other reason). There is no other way to break this technique.\n\n\n###### Venomous Spit (Speed 12, 10 AP, Chakra 10)\nHigh-velocity projectile poison! It deals 2d4*5 damage, ignores damage reduction and blocking, and may be a called shot--if used as a called shot, it has +1d6 accuracy. Someone hit by the spit must make a Resistance roll with a +3 bonus or be poisoned. It does not inflict wounds. However, if it's a called shot made at the victim's head, they suffer a -8 visibility penalty which is reduced by 1 every 10 IC, to a minimum of -4. Afterwards, it is reduced by 1 every week, finally fading entirely after a month. As it turns out, having poison in your eyes sucks.\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nA summoner may ask the cobra to provide some of its venom. It will offer enough venom to provide three doses. However, this is all it will do--after providing venom this way, it will unsummon itself (not staying around for combat, or to help otherwise); if it's already performed some other service for the summoner, it will refuse.\n\nThis venom will last for three weeks, after which time it is no longer toxic.\n\nAfter being milked for venom, the cobra cannot be summoned for four weeks.</text>\n\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Hydra\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nThe term is something of a misnomer. This actually summons individual giant snakes, each several hundred feet long and capable of crushing wooden buildings beneath them as they travel. These are long, brown, non-poisonous snakes, resembling giant boa constrictors.\n\nThe name comes from the fact that these snakes are able to fuse their bodies together, while maintaining multiple distinct heads.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25 + X * 10\n  -  Speed: 15 + X * 5\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nYou summon X snakes, up to a maximum of (total XP)/1500.\n\nIn addition to the once-per-week limitation on using a specific summon, you may only summon a total of (total XP)/1000 hydras in a two month (8 OOC day) period.\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nThe snakes are intelligent, but cannot speak. They understand directions well enough, however, and are reasonably obedient. They may ignore troublesome orders (like telling them not to attack that random civilian who just threw a rock at them), but won't be deliberately contrary.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 1500\n\n<br> STR: 150\n<br> RES: 100\n<br> CHA: 50\n<br> DEX: 120\n<br> AGI: 80\n\n<br> Accuracy: 40\n<br> Dodge: +25\n<br> Damage Bonus: 10\n<br> Movement: 2.5 yards per IC\n\n<br> Athletics: +15\n<br> Awareness: +35\n<br> Resistance +25\n<br> Survival: +20\n<BR>\n\n###### Enhanced Smell\nThe hydra halves visibility penalties to its Awareness rolls and Accuracy.\n\n###### Extended Range\nThe snakes have a 30 yard attack range, due to their immense size; these are still considered melee attacks.\n\n###### Hard Scales\nHydras have a Damage Reduction of 40.\n\n###### Huge\nHydras cannot dodge area-of-effect attacks; instead, they automatically block them as a Speed 0 defense. Hydras cannot hide (via stealth) due to being enormous. They cannot be knocked airborne, and any knockback effects have their efficacy reduced by half.\n\n###### Snake\nBecause they are snakes, hydras cannot be tripped. Any immobilization penalties are reduced by 5, and any reductions in movement speed from other sources are halved.\n\n###### Tireless\nHydras do not need to make Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls when they act. If forced to by an outside force (such as Suffocation), they have +15 to their rolls.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nHydra may use Dodge, Move, and Block as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB, without their summoner needing to spend AP. They may use Take The Hit normally, but commanding them to do so costs 5 AP.\n\n\n###### Combine (Speed 0)\nThis requires the hydras to all be within 50 yards of one another. They physically combine into a single being, their bodies seeming to melt together while maintaining however many distinct heads. This has the following effects:\n&gt; Damage reduction, remaining Vitality, and maximum Vitality is combined.\n&gt; Their Extended Range is changed to 20*(number of snakes) yards.\n&gt; Whenever they attack, thay may choose up to (number of snakes) different targets.\n&gt; +4 Accuracy, defensive rolls, grapple rolls, and skill rolls, for each snake beyond the first\n&gt; Smash deals +5d12 damage per snake, and their damage bonus is increased by 2 per snake.\n\n###### Constrict (Speed 10, 6 AP)\nA hydra can grab someone and wrap them in its tail. This is treated as a grapple, but the hydra suffers none of the normal penalties for being in a grapple. Every 10 IC, the person being constricted suffers a Suffocation 1 and takes 10*(hydra's damage bonus) damage. The hydra has a +10 bonus to its rolls to maintain the grapple. Escape Grapple cannot be used to escape from a hydra's constriction.\n\n###### Reflexive Block (Speed 4, 4 AP)\nIn addition to being able to declare blocking normally, hydras may do so reflexively as a Speed 4 Interrupt if their summoner spends 4 AP.\n\n\\page\n\n###### Serpent Strike (Variable AP)\nWhen directing the hydra's action, you may spend up to 10 AP improving its Accuracy; every 2 AP spent this way increases its Accuracy by 1.\n\n###### Smash (Speed 14, 5 AP)\nThe hydra tail-smashes, head butts, or just slithers over something, with destructive force! This deals 15d12 Blunt damage, and is considered a basic unarmed attack.</text>\n\n\\page\n## Summon Avatar: ???\n\nPresumably, there is an avatar-level snake summon. They're one of the most powerful summoned species, and respect power (mostly just their own) above all else, so certainly one of the creatures would have asserted its dominance over the rest. Those few individuals who have contracted with the snakes and gotten them to talk on the subject have been able to confirm that the snakes do have an avatar, but nothing more.\n\nIt's reasonably well-documented (to the extent that anything about summons is) that the previous avatar, Manda, required live human sacrifices in exchange for not devouring his summoner--not because he actually needed them, but simply because it pleased him to exert his authority that way. Whether that will hold true for his successor, however, is anyone's guess.\n\nAny information about this summon is probably going to have to come from summoning it first-hand.\n\nGood luck.\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\n  -  Chakra: 80\n  -  Speed: 40\n  -  Seal Speed: 30</text>\n  \n  \\page\n  \n## Spider Contract\nOf all the widely-known summon creatures, spiders have the greatest stigma attached to them. Of course, that's in part because as a species even ordinary spiders are much maligned. While normal spiders are entirely undeserving of their reputation, being helpful by killing off all manner of verminous insects.\n\nIt's hard to say whether summoned spiders actually are as malevolent as they're made out to be. They're certainly not friendly, and seem to be utterly devoid of ethics or morals (amoral, not immoral)--they'll just as gladly protect a village of innocent civilians as eat them all. Even shinobi who can summon them are incapable of giving any meaningful characteriations of the creatures they call on; more than any other summoned animal, the minds of the spiders are alien to humans.\n\nThat, really, is what makes them so frightening.\n\nThough the poison plays a role too, to be fair.\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n<br> 1000 XP: Web Weaving\n<br> 1500 XP: Summon: Spider Swarm\n<br> 2000 XP: Trap Door Minefield\n<br> 2500 XP: Summon: Kyodaigumo\n<br> 3000 XP: Spider Bite\n<br> 3750 XP: Summon:\n<br> 4500 XP: Discard the Dying Husk\n<br> 6000 XP: Summon: Tsuchigumo</text>\n## Techniques\n### --( Orisu - Web Weaving )--\nYou summon a supernaturally resilient, sticky, and large spider web. In the case of (relatively) smaller ones, the user actually spits these out as projectiles towards the targets. Larger ones appear above, and fall down onto, the area being covered in webs.\n\n  -  Chakra: 20 + X \n  -  Range: 10 + X\n  -  Area: X*2\n  -  Speed: 14\n  -  Seal Speed: 10 + X\n\nEffects:\nThis technique does not affect you or any of your spider summons. Anyone hit suffers a -4 immobilization penalty, which increases by 1 every 10 IC, to a maximum of -10, so long as they remain in the affected area. Anyone who dodges, or enters the area after it's been created, starts with a -2 immobilization penalty (as they are still inside the webbed area) which then increases normally.\n\nEvery 10 IC spent outside the web, its immobilization penalty decreases by 1.\n\nAlternately, you can remove the Area from this technique and target a single person who is already suffering from this technique's immobilization penalty. If they're hit, they're pulled X yards towards you and their immobilization penalty is increased by 1.\n\nUnlike normal techniques, this may be used more than once per week (OOC day). The total X values of all uses of Spider Web in a given week cannot exceed CHA/2; thus, with 40 CHA, you could use X = 10, X = 2, and then two X = 4, in the same OOC day. After each use, it cannot be used again for X*4 IC.\n\nX has a minimum of 1.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Hikimado Jiraigen - Trap Door Minefield )--\nYou summon a number of giant burrowing spiders beneath the battlefield, which lie in wait for an enemy to pass over them. When someone does, the ground collapses and they fall onto the waiting, more-than-man-sized spider, which delivers a bite of potent venom before disappearing.\n\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n  -  Area: 20\n\nEffects:\nWhen you use this technique you make a Stealth check with a -5 penalty; anyone watching, or who approaches the area, makes an Awareness roll against that. If they succeed, they'll notice that something is wrong with the area (and could reasonably surmise that avoiding it would be a good idea). If they fail, they don't know that there's anything unusual.\n\nWhile in the area, any time anyone other than you moves as part of  an attack, or spends 5 IC or more moving (total, in the latter case; 2 IC of movement, followed by 3 IC of movement, would trigger it), they must roll 1d3. On a roll of 1 they've walked over one of the traps, and immediately make an Athletics roll as their 'dodge' against your Accuracy (this does receive any bonuses and penalties to defensive rolls), with a penalty to their roll equal to their current Immobilization penalty (if any). If they succeed, they can continue normally. If they fail, they fall in and are attacked by the spider.\n\nFalling in does interrupt whatever action they were taking (unless they were just moving), in which case no costs are paid, the trap leaves them stuck at their original location, and their IC is not advanced based on the attack's Speed. The spider bites them before being unsummoned, afflicting them with a Stun X, where X is the amount they failed their Athletics roll by. You then make a Toxicology roll, using your XP/200 in place of your Toxicology skill ranks, against their Resistance. If they fail, they're poisoned; the venom of these spiders is Poison X/2 (maximum 8), Paralysis X/4 (maximum 4), and Duration X*5 (with no maximum).\n\n\\page\n\n\nIf used on an area where a web of Area 10 or greater has already been created, the trap field has a +10 bonus to its Stealth instead of a -5 penalty, and its Area is changed to that of the web. A single use of this jutsu has Y traps in it, where Y is the number of spider summons you have access (up to a maximum of, normally, 4). You can perform this technique from stealth without revealing your location.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kumo Koushou - Spider Bite )--\nThis technique temporarily transforms your canines (teeth, not pet dogs) into a pair of large fangs and briefly 'summons' the venom glands of a giant spider inside them. Then, in a rather unorthodox combat move you bite down on your victim and inject them with the toxin; this lasts only long enough for a single attempt, before the venom glands disappear and your teeth revert.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Damage: 15d12.open(6)*1\n  -  Accuracy: -10\n  -  Range: Melee\n  -  Speed: 15\n\nEffects:\nEvery point of Immobilization penalty that your target is suffering from reduce this technique's Accuracy penalty by 2, to a minimum of -0 (if they're at -5 immobilization or higher), and it's damage for the purposes of inflicting wounds is increased by 10% per point of Immobilization (to a maximum of +100%). They still suffer all the normal penalties for being immobilized.\n\nThis is a taijutsu attack which inflicts Piercing wounds and ignores DR and armor.\n\nIf this hits, it poisons the enemy with either Black Widow or Brown Recluse poison (chosen when you declare the attack). For your Toxicology roll, use (XP)/200 in place of your Toxicology skill ranks. If Brown Recluse poison is used, it's raised to Poison 3, and its Duration is lowered to 500. If Black Widow poison is used, it's raised to Poison 4 and the penalty to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls is raised to -6. Antidotes for those poisons still work normally.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Shindakara Haki - Discard the Dying Husk )--\nYou 'shed' your skin and in a blur of motion escape from your 'shell', which is left infused with chakra and capable of acting independently, as if nothing happened. This technique is best used to beat a hasty retreat when in danger, as it leaves you vulnerable and also buys time until your opponents realize what happened.\n\n  -  Chakra: 60\n  -  Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nYou are moved up to (CHA)*(0.6) yards away in any direction, and immediately make a Stealth roll with a +15 bonus; enemies who fail their Awareness roll do not realize anything happened. You are then immediately raised to Stealth 2. When you use this technique you lose half (rounded up) your remaining Willpower, have your current AP set to 0, and automatically advance an additional Fatigue level (though not if doing so would render you unconscious) after the Chakra Exhaustion roll has been resolved. At the same time, all ongoing Immobilization, Ignite, and Burn effects you are suffering from are removed.\n\nYour 'old' body is left behind to fight. It functions exactly as you do, but you have no mental link with it. It retains all your equipment, but cannot benefit from any consumable items (such as soldier pills).\n\nThis technique can be used from stealth, without breaking your stealth (though it will remove you from level 3 stealth). If an enemy finds you while you're still hiding after using this technique, roll 1d2. On a roll of 1, they found you; on a roll of 2, they found your shell and believe it to be you.\n\nYour shell has all your traits along with Vitality equal to how much Vitality or HP you had remaining when you used this technique (whichever was higher), and is at the same Fatigue level you were at before performing this technique. It can use any jutsu you knew, but cannot spend Willpower and is considered to be Holding Back (as per the ability) at all times (even if you normally lack the ability to do so). It does not receive a bonus to Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls based on its Fatigue. On the other hand, it's immune to poison, bleeding, and suffocation. When its Vitality reaches 0, or it reaches the point of passing out from Fatigue, it breaks apart and crumbles into a pile of brittle chitin.\n\nThis technique's Speed cannot be reduced. So long as the shell survives, neither you nor it gain any AP.</text>\n\n\\page\n## Summon: Spider Swarm\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nWhile still terrifyingly large, these spiders aren't &quot;giant&quot; by the standards of most summoned creatures--a person could fit three or four of them on the palm of their hand without too much difficulty. However, also unlike most summons, these calls forth dozens of the creatures. Rather than appearing in a puff of smoke, they will, if the terrain allows for it, come crawling out from under rocks, down from the branches in trees, burrowing up from under soft soil, and so on.\n\n  -  Chakra: 10 + X\n  -  Speed: 8\n  -  Seal Speed: 14\n\nThis calls 20+CHA/10 spiders; this is your Swarm size (see Attributes, below). You may use this technique multiple times in the same day, with subsequent uses adding 2d20+CHA/20 spiders to your existing Swarm. You cannot create multiple spider swarms. The X in the Chakra cost is (your current Swarm size)/4.\n\nThis technique can be used multiple times in the same day, unlike normal summons. However, once the swarm departs or is wiped out you cannot call another one for 3 OOC days (3 IC weeks).\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nDespite being far more intelligent than they should be for something of their size, these creatures are still mostly animalistic, and are incapable of conversation or meaningful independent action. They can understand and follow orders, and execute them rather cleverly, but not much else.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: N/A\n\n<br> Accuracy: 20\n<br> Dodge: +8\n<br> Damage Bonus: 4.0\n<br> Movement: N/A\n\n<br> Athletics: +5\n<br> Awareness: +10\n<br> Resistance: +1\n<br> Survival: +15\n\n###### Horde\nThe spider swarm takes only 1/4 damage from single-target attacks, and is immune to genjutsu. Area-of-effect techniques have their damage reduced by (Swarm size)%, to a maximum of 50%. They cannot be grappled and are immune to status effects other than area-affecting immobilization and visibility penalties. They are also immune to any single-target non-damaging effects (such as Trip and Feint).\n\n###### Swarm\nFor combat purposes the swarm is treated as a single entity. It has  a bonus to Accuracy and d20 rolls of (Swarm sze)/8. Swarm size is determined when the spiders are summoned, and raised by repeated use of this summoning technique. Rather than having Vitality like a normal summon, every 10 points of damage reduces the Swarm size by 1. A single-target attack may not remove more than half (rounded up) the Swarm's size in a single attack.\n\n###### Unnerving Presence\nThe spiders are constantly creeping around, sneaking up on unsuspecting foes--and have some eerie way of never being too far from their summoner. Rather than moving, the swarm can attack (and be attacked) from anywhere within (DEX /2) yards of their summoner.\n\n###### Web Body\nDespite being spiders, they're also ninja spiders! When these creatures 'die', they explode into a burst of extremely sticky webbing. Any melee attack which reduces the Swarm size causes a -2 Immobilization penalty on the attacker which fades at the rate of 1 point per 10 IC. Any area-of-effect technique which reduces the swarm size instead inflicts this penalty on everyone within (number the Swarm was reduced by) yards. Anyone who has the Spider contract is immune to this immobilization penalty. The penalty from Web Body spiders stacks additively with any other Immobilization effect caused by some portion of the Spider contract. If someone already suffering from Web Body's immobilization is afflicted by it again, their existing penalty is instead increased by 1, to a maximum of -6.\n\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nThe spider swarm may use Dodge as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP; however, since it cannot actually move on its own, it is likely to suffer massive dodge penalties against area-of-effect techniques.\n\n\n###### Detonate (Speed 4, X AP)\nSpiders explode into a mess of sticky webbing! This reduces your Swarm size by X, and has an Area of X; it can be centered on any location in your Swarm's range. If the swarm's last action was to use Poisonous Bite on someone, and that person is the target of their Detonate, they will be automatically hit. Detonate causes no damage, but inflicts the Web Body immobilization penalty on anyone who fails to defend themselves.\n\n\\page\n\n###### Gnaw (Speed 12, 4 * X AP)\nThe spiders swarm over the user and gnaw off anything that may be hindering them. Their super chakra-enhanced mandibles can break through chains, vines, or even webs. This lowers an existing Immobilization penalty on the user or someone within the swarm's range by X. This cannot remove Immobilization penalties based on the terrain (such as Yomi Numa) or caused by wounds. &quot;X&quot; has a maximum of the Swarm size.\n\n###### Poisonous Bite (Speed 6, 6+X/5 AP)\nThe spiders swarm a victim and bite them, injecting venom and causing a surprising level of immediate physical harm (they are, after all, ninja spiders). This deals (X/3)d20 damage, ignores armor, inflicts Piercing wounds, and causes a Poison (X/5) effect which lasts for 25 IC. X has a maximum of the Swarm size.\n\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nUnlike most summoned creatures, Spider Swarms will not 'care' if you catch them in your own area-of-effect techniques.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Kyodaigumo\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n  -  Chakra: 30\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nWhile terrifyingly intelligent, the Kyodaigumo isn't able to make much use of that in battle: it's much too large to hide itself, and not particularly well-equipped for direct combat. It compensates for that by calling more spiders into battle for it, and seeking to overwhelm enemies through sheer numers.\n\nWhile it will willingly participate in setting up traps and ambushes for its summoner, and has no objections to patiently laying in wait to attack, the Kyodaigumo is reluctant to use its Brood Mother attribute or Egg Sac abilities outside of combat. It will do so if asked to by its summoner, but 50 IC later if battle has not begun it will unsummon itself.\n\n(As a note from the editor: Do not try to find ways to abuse this by being &quot;technically&quot; in combat. I will not be amused, and the spider's smarter than that anyway.)\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 2400\n\n<br> STR: 80\n<br> RES: 120\n<br> CHA: 60\n<br> DEX: 80\n<br> AGI: 40\n\n<br> Accuracy: 30\n<br> Dodge: +10\n<br> Damage Bonus: 7.5\n<br> Movement: 1 yard per IC\n\n<br> Athletics: +25\n<br> Awareness: +25\n<br> Resistance: +25\n<br> Stealth: +5\n<br> Survival: +25\n\n\n###### Bestial\nThe Kyodaigumo isn't driven by higher desires, and as a result cannot be negotiated or reasoned with and has a +15 defensive bonus to Genjutsu rolls. They are, however, fairly intelligent.\n\n###### Brood Mother\nEvery Spider Swarm active while Kyodaigumo is present needs to be dealt twice as much damage to reduce its size, and has its Swarm size increased by 1d10 every time the IC reaches a multiple of 10. The first benefit is lost if the Kyodaigumo is unsummoned, but the increased size remains.\n\n###### Exoskeleton\nWhen blocking, the Kyodaigumo reduces incoming damage by 75% (as opposed to 50%). Blocking is not less effective against weapons (normally, it is 25% less effective).\n\n###### Web Body\nIf the Kyodaigumo takes 75% or more of its current Vitality in a single attack, it explodes into massive cloud of spider webbing. The Area is equal to (Kyodaigumo's remaining Vitality before being hit with that attack)/10 yards. Everyone in this area suffers a -6 Immobilization penalty. Individuals with the Spider contract suffer only a -4 penalty.\n\n###### Web Walker\nIf the Kyodaigumo is suffering an Immobilization penalty caused by spider webs, that penalty is instead a bonus to its Accuracy, Dodge, and Athletics rolls. It has a bonus to its Awareness rolls against anyone suffering from such a penalty equal to the severity of that penalty (so, if they had a -6 Immobilization penalty from webs, it would have +6 Awareness against them). Its movement speed is increased by 10% for every point of web-based Immobilization applied to it (rather than reduced).\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n######    Standard Actions\nThe kyodaigumo may use the dodge, block, and hide actions as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of hte summoner's AP.\n\n\n######    Egg Sac (Speed X*5, X*3 AP)\nThe spider summons an egg sac filled with baby spiders, which immediately bursts and releases the creatures onto the battlefield. This may either create a new Spider Swarm, containing Xd20 spiders, or add to an already-existing swarm. This cannot take a swarm above 100 spiders (any 'extra' are simply lost).\n\n######    Poisonous Bite (Speed 14, 10 AP)\nThe spider bites someone, and injects them with venom! It's not strong enough to be lethal to most shinobi, though it's still far from harmless. This deals 6d20 Piercing damage, ignores Armor and DR, and inflicts a Poison 4 status for 100 IC if it deals damage--there is no Toxicology or Resistance roll involved.\n\n######    Web Spinning (Speed 20, 15 AP)\nThe Kyodaigumo may perform this tehcniques (listed in the Techniques section of the contract), though it uses the listed Speed, has no Seal Speed, and may only use it once per time it's summoned.\n\n\\page\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nIf there are any active Spider Swarms, it is possible to cause a Breach of Contract with the Kyodaigumo.\n\nSpecifically, if the summoner completely wipes out one of their swarms, or a swarm summoned by another creature called by the Spider contract, it will be considered a Breach of Contract.</text>\n\n\\page\n## Summon: The Assassin Spider\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nUsing a series of tricks and illusions, the assassin spider is no minor inconvenience. It can make the safest place feel dangerous, or the most dangerous areas appear safe. It is small, smaller than even some of the swarming spiders, only about a foot long, but it's bite is not to be trifled with. It has immense front eyes because of the way it hunts, it is a jumping spider! It's favored prey is the sneaky kinda...other spiders...or ninja.\n\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nIt keeps to the shadows, moves to stealth whenever it gets the opportunity. It uses illusions to separate people and then when it has the opportunity to get someone alone, it STRIKES trying to finish them.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 2250\n\n<br> STR: 65\n<br> RES: 95\n<br> CHA: 60\n<br> DEX: 80\n<br> AGI: 100\n\n<br> Accuracy: 36\n<br> Dodge: +40\n<br> Parry: +45\n<br> Damage Bonus: 10.5\n<br> Movement: 3 yard per IC\n<br> Genjutsu: +40\n\n<br> Athletics: +45\n<br> Awareness: +45\n<br> Espionage: +50\n<br> Resistance: +45\n<br> Stealth: +50\n<br> Survival: +45\n\n###### God of the Shadows\nAny attack the Assassin Spider makes from stealth is automatically a sneak attack, and after making any attack the spider can roll a new stealth and re-enter stealth, though at a -5 penalty.\n\n###### Web Walker\nIf the Assassin Spider is suffering an Immobilization penalty caused by spider webs, that penalty is instead a bonus to its Accuracy, Dodge, and Athletics rolls. It has a bonus to its Awareness rolls against anyone suffering from such a penalty equal to the severity of that penalty (so, if they had a -6 Immobilization penalty from webs, it would have +6 Awareness against them). Its movement speed is increased by 10% for every point of web-based Immobilization applied to it (rather than reduced).\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n######    Standard Actions\nThe Assassin Spider may use the dodge, block, parry, and hide actions as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n######    Trap Illusion (Speed 10, 20 AP)\nThis is a genjutsu that causes the target to 'want to be alone' for some unknown reason. They will not disclose the reason to others, they feel compelled to keep it to themselves. Every 30 IC, or 5 Minutes OOC, the target gets another chance to roll against the spider. The target will go as far as  to escape their allies as fast as they can to get alone.\n\n######    Fangs of the End (Speed 5, 8 AP)\nThis spider has very specialized fangs, they are almost 2/3rds the size of it's body so it packs quite the bite. Dealing 12d10, if this is a sneak attack it inflicts a Poison 50 that lasts 20 IC.\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------</text>\n\nThis spider is simple, give it a target and it will follow through in finishing them. It will accept as much as a second target, but no more. After defeating two targets it will dismiss.\n\n\\page\n \n## Summon Avatar: Tsuchigumo \nTsuchigumo, also known as Yatsukahagi and Ogumo (&quot;Great Spider&quot;), is an individual or a position among the spiders; it's not clear if there's only one Tsuchigumo, or if the title is passed from one spider-ruler to the next. In mythology, Tsuchigumo appears as a usually malevolent trickster who is confronted and ultimately defeated by various heroes; sometimes they kill the spider, and in others they demand a boon in exchange for enduring its trials (and usually surviving one or more attempts on their life). Its actions are typically presented less as the result of genuine malice, and more a case of a spider simply doing what spiders do.\n\nThough Tsuchigumo takes the form of an enormous spider broodmother (at least, in the memory of shinobi), it's said she can also assume human form. She rarely likes to intervene directly in combat, preferring to send her subordinates and children to handle those matters for her. Tsuchigumo likely has strong associations with the earth (the name, after all, literally means &quot;Earth Spider&quot;).\n\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 40\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nIt's no secret among holders of either the Spider or Monkey contract that Tsuchigumo and Enma have a long-standing enmity. More serious than rivalry, but not quite intense enough to constitute hatred, the two will go out of their way to confront one another when present on the same battlefield, and will refuse to fight on the same side.\n\nWhile Tsuchigumo would be malefic by human standards, a more accurate understanding of her behavior might be that she is amoral, or at best has a sense of right and wrong incomprehensible to her summoners.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\nWhat's known of Tsuchigumo's capabilities come from a mixture of hearsay and legends.\n\nIt's said she's a shapeshifter and illusionist, with some degree of command over the earth. If not wise, she is certainly cunning. She has a reputation for being extremely difficult to reason with, not due to stubbornness, but because her whims or reasons for acting are virtually incomprehensible.\n\nWhen she does fight, as Queen of the Spiders she is capable of calling upon her progeny in vast numbers.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Toad Contract\nThe toads are a misunderstood group as a whole, alternately referred to as a gang of thieves and ruffians by some, and being valorous and noble protectors of the weak who're just rough around the edges.\n\nBoth are somewhat accurate. The social structure of the summoned toads bears more than a passing resemblance to a Yakuza 'family'. Much like an actual crime syndicate the toads usually want nothing to do with outsiders, but are more than happy to help one of their own. They have no problem carrying weapons, and make use of them extensively in combat; where exactly the toads are getting a supply of giant weapons is a mystery to this day.\n\nAnd, much like the idealized versions of Yakuza syndicates, they do have a code of honor. They don't prey upon the weak, they stand up for the 'little guy', and so on. Most toads, despite being perfectly okay with the sort of work ninja might call upon them to do, won't harm the innocent or do have anything to do with genuinely 'evil' or malicious actions. They tend to fit the cultural stereotype of the &quot;gangster with a heart of gold.&quot;\n\nLike any well-organized group, they are expressly concerned with the well-being and advancement of their own interests. A summoner is tasked with become a fitting member of the 'family', and if he upholds the same standards and ideals as the toads he'll be sure to rise within ranks, gaining greater standing, prestise, and responsibility.\n\n\n====================\nAccess\n------------------------------\n\n<br> 1000 XP: Summon: Guardian Toad\n<br> 1500 XP: Scroll Toad\n<br> 2000 XP: Hiding in a Toad Technique\n<br> 2500 XP: Toad Mouth Bind\n<br> 3000 XP: Summon: Kyodai\n<br> 4000 XP: Barrier Gourd Prison\n<br> 5000 XP: Food Cart Destroying Technique\n<br> 6000 XP: Summon: Gamabunta</text>\n## Techniques\n### --( Kuchiyose: Fukugama - Summoning: Scroll Toad )--\nScroll Toads are an anatomical impossibility even among summoned creatures, which says a great deal. They're tall and appear seated upright, and seem to be wearing an obi.\n\nUpon being asked, the toad rises up and reveals that the middle of its body is actually a rolled-up scroll; that scroll can then be extended and have any number of important things inscribed upon it, usually summoning contracts, important seals, secret information, or forbiden techniques. Once the summoner no longer needs the scroll any more, it can be unsummoned.\n\nAlternately, the toad can climb into the summoner's mouth and somehow reside in their stomach indefinitely, to be called out again when the scroll is needed. How this works is unclear, and probably best not dwelled upon.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 50\n\nEffects:\nEach summoner with this contract is assigned their own unique scroll toad, and unless a special deal is made with the toads only ever has that one scroll toad to call upon. The scroll toad sticks around to do its job (having things written on it), and then leaves or climbs into the summoner's stomach (inflicting a Stun 40 on the summoner). Retrieving a scroll stored this way is a Speed 20 action.\n\nNobody but the summoner themselves can retrieve the scroll from their stomach; if the summoner is killed, the toad will simply unsummon itself. Normally, information on the scroll will be stored indefinitely, but the toad can, at the summoner's request, wipe part or all of the scroll clean.\n\nOnce the summoner has decided he no longer needs the scroll, the toad can climb out and will head home. After being unsummoned, the Scroll Toad cannot be called upon again for eight weeks.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Gamagakure no Jutsu - Hiding in a Toad Technique )--\nA spectacular infiltration technique, if one that gives most of its users some serious second thoughts the first few times they find themselves using it. The shinobi summons a small toad and climbs (or leaps, or jumps, or dives) into it; somehow the toad is able to bend space in such a way that not only can the summoner fit into its mouth, they can stay comfortably inside until the air supply runs out.\n\nAll forms of detection and communication fail to penetrate the toad's stomach; as a result the user is almost impossible to detect, but also unable to tell what the situation in the outside world is.\n\nThe toad gives the summoner a ride to a pre-specified location, and once there (or upon a trigger condition) spits the summoner out before unsummoning itself.\n\n  -  Chakra: 35\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 60\n\nEffects:\nA small diving toad is summoned.After giving it instructions the summoner hops inside its mouth (...somehow) and loses all contact with the outside world. Inside the toad the summoner cannot perceive, or be perceived by, the outside world. Communication devices won't work, Chakra Sensing will fail to penetrate the toad's stomach, and so on.\n\nThe interior is humid and unpleasantly warm, but tolerable. There's a 48 hour supply of air, but the summoner will need to bring their own food and water (drinking a toad's stomach acid is not particularly advisable). While inside the toad's stomach the summoner will not recover Fatigue or Vitality.\n\\page\n\nThe toad can be told to release the summoner on a number of conditions (given to it before the summoner hops inside): it reaches a set location, a certain amount of time has passed (or automatically after air runs out), a specific person described in detail is standing in front of the toad, or automatically if the toad is attacked (in which case the shinobi will be spit out and the toad will unsummon itself). More than one condition can be set, either in combination (&quot;at that place and at that time&quot;) or as alternatives (&quot;at that place or in front of that person&quot;).\n\nA small creature, the diving toad is just slightly too large to fit on someone's hand. It can dive up to 100 yards in fresh water, and can stay submerged in mud or fresh water indefinitely. If attacked it unsummons itself immediately.\n\nWhile being capable of speech, diving toads will frequently complain that people &quot;all look the same&quot; to it. If told to release its passenger in front of a person, that person must be standing directly in front of it, in plain view, and within two yards. Additionally, the summoner must be able to provide a picture of them or have a very good description with two or more unique, identifying features (which can lead to mix-ups, on rare occasions). Otherwise, the toad won't be able to recognize them.\n\nThe diving toad can only be summoned once every four weeks.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Gamaguchi Shibari - Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind )--\nClassified as a partial summoning, the shinobi summons the esophagus of a great fire-breathing toad said to live on Mount Myoboku. This is only usable inside buildings, caves, or other confined areas; the esophageal lining covers the floors, walls, and ceilings in their entirety, and seals up any remaining exits. If deployed properly, there will be hardly any time at all for the victims inside to escape, leaving them trapped inside--a very unfortunate situation, as the summoner can then control the toad's esophagus to move and ensare their enemies.\n\n  -  Chakra: 40\n  -  Upkeep: 6\n  -  Area: 50\n  -  Speed: 20, Delay 10\n  -  Seal Speed: 25\n  -  Special: Can only be used in confined areas/indoors/caves\n\nEffects:\nThe stomach lining of a giant toad appears and begins growing to cover all passageways, extending outwards from the summoner to the full Area of the technique. Anyone who hasn't exited the area by the time the Delay ends is trapped inside; anyone able to leave before then escapes automatically.\n\nBy spending 5 AP, the summoner can direct the esophagus to ensnare any number of targets trapped within (extending 'whips' of flesh from the lining to restrain them if necessary), increasing each of their immobilization penalties by 1. This may be done up to once every 5 IC, and does not require any actual action on the summoner's part, though does necessitate a Chakra 10 roll.\n\nThose trapped can take a Speed 10, Stamina 15 action to pull themselves free, reducing the immobilization penalty from Toad Mouth Bind by 2.\n\nThe linings of the esophagus are extremely resilient, with each square meter (an area large enough for a person to squeeze out of) having 500 HP, and a DR of 200 which applies against Katon, Blunt, and multi-throwing attacks, as well as regenerating 200 Hp every 10 IC. Toad Mouth Bind can be used once every 2 months (8 OOC days).\n\\page\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kekkai: Gama Hyoro - Barrier Gourd Prison )--\nThis technique generates a powerful spatial barrier centered around the user which transports anyone caught in it (including the user themselves) into the stomach of a gourd toad: a massive, cavernous area filled with a lake of corrosive gastric acid, and, for some reason, many small partially-digested buildings still standing within it.\n\nThe only way to escape is to defeat the summoner, convince them to end the technique, or wait until its duration ends--and neither of the last two tend to be all that effective.\n\nAt the location where this technique was used a large, black kanji for &quot;oil&quot; is imprinted on the ground; when the technique ends, that mark vanishes and the stomach's previous occupants are deposited in the nearest relatively safe (so, not on fire, covered in spikes, directly under a net, or so on) area within a hundred yards.\n\n  -  Chakra: 45\n  -  Upkeep: 4\n  -  Range: 50\n  -  Area: 20\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\nEffects:\nAs soon as it activates, this technique automatically transports anyone within its Area, centered on the user, to the gourd toad's stomach; the user may choose not to activate this aspect of it (though they will always be transported there themselves), but it's all-or-nothing; they can take everyone within 20 yards of themselves, or nobody.\n\nAdditionally, they may target up to one person within its range, with +4 Accuracy and ignoring any Fatigue penalties the user currently suffers from. A giant toad's tongue lashes out from the spot the summoner vanished at, snatches that person up, and pulls them into the spatial distortion.\n\nThis technique will last a maximum of five minutes. Until then, it is impossible for anyone to enter or exit the toad's stomach.\n\nAs long as this isn't the summoner's first time being inside, they have a home field advantage. This gives them a +3 bonus to Accuracy, defense, Awareness, and Stealth while inside the stomach. If somebody is knocked back or thrown more than 3 yards they'll be knocked into the acid, suffering a Stun 10 and taking Xd10 energy damage (with no damage bonus applied), where X is the number of IC which pass before their next action (at which point they are assumed to pull themself out of the acid). Water walking does not function on this stomach acid.\n\nToad Gourd Prison may only be used once every 3 months (12 OOC days).\n\n____________________________________________\n\n### --( Kuchiyose: Yatai Kuzushi no Jutsu - Summoning: Food Cart Destroying Technique )--\nIt is unclear where this technique earned its name, as using it to destroy a food cart would be overkill of the highest degree. A giant, several-story-tall toad is summoned in mid-air above the unfortunate victim of this technique, and proceeds to fall on top of them. While this isn't the quickest method of deploying a summon, or attacking an enemy, available, it's hard to rival its ability to cause wide-area destruction.\n\n  -  Chakra: X (Minimum 30, Maximum 60)\n  -  Speed: X/2, Delay X/3\n  -  Damage: Xd12.open(6)*1\n  -  Range: 100\n  -  Area: 80\n  -  Seal Speed: 50 \n\nEffects:\nThis may only be used if a Kyodai is available to be summoned. It replaces the normal Speed and Seal Speed for doing so.\n\nA Kyodai is summoned X*5 yards above the target (make the Chakra Exhaustion roll for the summon after Food Cart Destroyer's); from there gravity does its thing, and the toad falls. This technique has a damage bonus of 0, but anyone who is still in its area when the Delay ends is automatically hit. The summoned toad takes no damage, and may act after they hit the ground.</text>\n\\page\n\n## Summon: Guardian\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nGuardian Toads are chest-high on a man, which, given the squat nature of the species, makes them quite bulky. They're large enough for a person to ride on, at least in theory, though will not allow their summoners to do so; it would be disrespectful, and they're guardians and enforcers, not horses.\n\nGuardians can range in color from bright orange and green to washed-out browns and yellows, and any number of shades inbetween. More often than not Guardians are summoned into battle, so they come appropriately equipped for combat, outfitted in metal armor and ready to exhibit their exceptional taijutsu skill.\n\n  -  Chakra: 25\n  -  Speed: 15\n  -  Seal Speed: 20\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nThe Guardian are quite smart--smarter than most people, though that's not necessarily saying much--but aren't much for conversation. They fill the role of a low-level enforcer or bodyguard for a minor official, being called on to provide a bit of extra muscle when the summoner needs backup. If they're not given all the information they need to perform a task, they'll fill in the blanks to the best of their judgment. Communication will usually involve affirmative grunts and the occasional wordless grumble.\n\nAs this is one of the more commonly called-upon summons of its contract, many summons will call the same Guardian for backup in most situations, and build a stronger relationship with them. Eventually this leads to actually getting monosyllabic verbal responses from the toad (&quot;Yup&quot; and &quot; 'Kay,&quot; being close to the limit of their willingness to converse), and the toad actually, occasionally, asking for elaboration when it needs it.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 1000\n\n<br> STR: 60\n<br> RES: 50\n<br> CHA: 60\n<br> DEX: 50\n<br> AGI: 50\n\n<br> Accuracy: 20\n<br> Dodge: +10\n<br> Damage Bonus: 3.0\n<br> Movement: 2 yards per IC. \n\n<br> Athletics: +10\n<br> Awareness: +10\n<br> Resistance: +15\n<BR>\n\n\n###### Armor\nThe Guardian is heavily armored, having a DR of (Damage Bonus*10).\n\n###### Big Mouth\nThe Guardian has a large enough mouth that it can fit many small objects within it, keeping them protected from harm and outside influence. The object can only be removed by inflicting a called shot to the toad's mouth that does 500 or more damage in a single strike(it doesn't inflict a wound, just frees the object). The toad can hold about the same amount as a single sealing scroll in its mouth (or a Scroll Toad). \n\n###### Shatei\nThe Guardian Toad works hard to keep up with its summoner, gaining a bonus of (Summoner's XP)/250 to accuracy, defenses, and skill rolls. In addition, the Guardian's damage bonus is increased by (Summoner's XP)/500. Finally, their Vitality is increased by (Summoner's XP / 500)*100.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n######    Standard Actions\nGuardian Toads may use Dodge, Move, and Parry as described in the Combat chapter of the PHB without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n######    Defend (Speed 1 or 6, Interrupt, AP 1 or 6)\nGuardians can block as a Speed 1 Interrupt by spending 1 AP. Alternately, they can use Take the Hit as a Speed 6 Interrupt with a cost of 6 AP; after taking the hit they are considered to be blocking if they succeed by at least 1 point.\n\n######    Toad Strike (Speed 10, AP 4)\nThe toad leaps forward and delivers a powerful palm strike inflicting 10d10.extra(6) blunt damage. This counts as a basic unarmed attack. \n\\page\n\n######    Tongue Lash (Speed 4, AP 8)\nOnce every 20 IC, the toad may lash out with its tongue; this has a range of 10 yards and +2 Accuracy. Used as an attack, this deals 5d20.extra(12) blunt damage. Alternately, it may be used to retrieve an object on the battlefield and hide it in their mouth. This can also be used to strike a weapon or object someone is holding, making a disarm check (with no penalty for large or small weapons). If successfully used as a disarm the toad may either toss the object aside (as per normal disarm rules) or immediately retrieve it and store it in its mouth. Tongue Lash cannot be used while the toad already has something stored in its mouth.\n\n====================\n5. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nAs mentioned, the Guardian is a bodyguard and enforcer, ready to protect its summoner and any important 'acquisitions'. They'll gladly jump in front of an attack aimed for their summoner if the need arises (though will only do so for things which seem like they'd be an actual threat to the summoner's well-being), and will gladly bring up the rear in an escape.\n\nTha said, they expect to receive an appropriate amount of respect for their efforts, and be treated as a valued underling, not a disposable thug. Bringing up the rear in an escape is one thing, but asking them to hold enemies off until they succumb to their wounds is another entirely. Leaving them in combat while you flee (which is not the same as having them cover your escape, then unsummoning them once you've got a head start) constitutes a Breach of Contract.\n\nAdditionally, if the Guardian is unsummoned due to injuries (vitality dropping to zero) it cannot be summoned again for four weeks.</text>\n\\page\n## Summon: Kyodai\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n3. Attributes\n4. Abilities\n5. Terms of Contract\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nWithin actual yakuza organizations, the rank of &quot;Kyodai&quot; refers to senior enforcers of individual gangs, leaders in their own right. Within the mob-family-like organization of the toads, these giant specimens occupy the same rank. Each of them is truly massive, towering above most trees and buildings and approaching the Toad Avatar, Gamabunta, in size. On top of that, every one of them is a skilled combatant, often bringing appropriately scaled-up weapons into combat with them. Their coloration varies wildly from one to the next, encompassing just about every coloration found in actual toads, and several not encountered in any natural species.\n\n  -  Chakra: 50\n  -  Speed: 20\n  -  Seal Speed: 30\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nKyodai are quite capable of conversation, though how talkative they are varies greatly from one to the next; they all have distinct personalities, and so summoners will tend to call upon the same few repeatedly to build a greater rapport--much like people, they get along better with someone they see more often.\n\nThat said, how they react to the summoner depends largely upon that summoner's 'rank' within their organization.\n\nIf a summoner can't call on Gamabunta, they're viewed as an underling, or at best a not-very-respected equal, who needs some extra muscle to bail them out of a tight situation. Assisting them is a necessary evil, and the toad will do what it needs to to finish the job and head home as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nIf the summoner has summoned Gamabunta in the past and has at least a passing degree of respect from Mount Myoboku's Oyabun, the toad warriors treat summoners as respected peers as long as they get a similar degree of respect in return.\n\n====================\n3. Attributes\n------------------------------\n\n<br> Vitality: 3000\n\n<br> STR: 140\n<br> RES: 100\n<br> CHA: 60\n<br> DEX: 120\n<br> AGI: 100\n\n<br> Accuracy: 40\n<br> Dodge: +25\n<br> Damage Bonus: 10\n<br> Movement: 4 yards per IC\n\n<br> Athletics: +25\n<br> Awareness: +20\n<br> Espionage: +20\n<br> Resistance: +30\n<BR>\n\n\n\n###### Giant Weapons\nParrying a giant toad's weapons is not generally advisable. It can only be done by someone with at least 140 STR, and they suffer a Stun (200 - their STR)/10 whether or not they succeed. Otherwise, all normal rules for parrying weapons apply.\n\n###### Huge\nKyodai cannot hide, due to their size. They cannot be knocked airborne or tripped, and any knockback effects have their efficacy reduced by half. Additionally, their attacks have a range of 20 yards, though are still considered to be melee range.\n\n###### Jump\nBeing toads, they're quite adept at jumping, and frequently do so when they need to cross large distances in a pinch. When a Kyodai moves as part of an attack, they may a distance equal to the full Speed worth of movement--in other words, if using a Speed 12 attack they may move up to (12 * 4) 48 yards as part of it.\n\\page\n\n\n###### Kyodai\nAs befits their rank and skill, the giant toad warriors all bring some form of weapon to battle. When you summon a warrior, choose which of the following weapons they'll be equipped with. You may summon a different sort of weapon-user each time, if you please.\n\n - Mancatcher and Shield: The toad's mancatcher is a vaguely Y-shaped metal weapon, with short spikes covering each prong. The shield allows this toad to block attacks as a Speed 5 Interrupt by paying 5 AP, which reduces damage by 60% and is fully effective when blocking weapons. The shield will break, however, once the total damage of all attacks it's been used to block reaches 3000.\n    The mancatcher can be used as a Speed 14 attack dealing 16d10 Blunt damage, and has a +1 bonus to Accuracy. Used against human-sized opponents, they suffer a -4 immobilization penalty until their next action. Against Large summons, they suffer a -4 immobilization penalty that does not reduce their movement speed until the Kyodai attacks with it again or they move outside of its attack range. Their movement speed is reduced by (Kyodai's STR - that summon's STR)/10 yards per IC. Any summons with a size description other than Large suffer a Stun equal to however many points they were hit by.\n\n - Twin Katana: The toad appears with two katanas. Using them is a Speed 14 attack dealing 28d8 Slashing damage; if used to parry, they have a +2 bonus. Whenever the toad attacks with these weapons they may select two targets who are both in range, attacking one with each weapon. Both katanas may be used to simultaneously attack any Large or larger summon, in which case the number of damage dice remains unchanged but the toad's damage bonus is increased to 15 for that attack.\n\n - Wakizashi: The Wakizashi deals 14d12 Slashing damage, and is a Speed 12 attack with +2 Accuracy. The toad may use it to attack without spending the summoner's AP, but if it does so it cannot attack again for 20 IC (instead of 12 IC, based on the attack's Speed); this does not actually change the Speed of the attack.\n\n - Tetsubo: Yes, a huge wooden club, probably made from an actual tree trunk and fitted with metal studs. This attack has -4 Accuracy, but cannot be parried. It is a Speed 20 attack dealing 20d20 Blunt damage, with a damage bonus of 20. If it hits, in inflicts a Stun 8. However, the AP cost to attack with it is increased by 5 (to 10 for Skillful Strike, and 15 + X for Leap Attack).\n\n - Twin Sai: A paired set of sai; while they do have a +4 bonus to parrying weapons, it's usually not all that useful for a giant toad. Attacking with them is a Speed 12 action, and they deal 14d10 Blunt damage. If an attack with these weapons misses, the summoner may spend 5 AP for the toad to make a strike with the second sai, in which case an Accuracy roll replaces their normal Accuracy.\n\n - Bare Hands: Yes! This toad knows martial arts! They make Speed 10 attacks dealing 10d12 Blunt damage. However, if their attacks miss they do not expend any of the summoner's AP. If their attacks hit, the summoner may immediately spend another 4 AP to have the toad perform a flashy series of blows which inflicts a Stun 4 on the victim.\n\n====================\n4. Abilities\n------------------------------\n\n###### Standard Actions\nKyodai may use the dodge, move, and block actions as described in the Combat chapter without spending any of the summoner's AP.\n\n\n###### Leap (Speed 5, 10 AP)\nThe Kyodai can leap up to 300 yards horizontally, or 150 yards vertically, or any combination of the two (so, at maximum, a 300 yard horizontal leap that carried them in an arc which, at its highest point, reached 150 yards off the ground). For determining how long this takes to cross the entire length, use whichever distance is greater; during the leap, the toad travels at a rate of 10 yards per IC. While in mid-air the toad is free to take other actions, but cannot move, change direction, or dodge area-of-effect attacks.\n\n###### Leap Attack (Speed X + Variable, 10 + X AP)\nThe toad lunges for its target with incredible speed! This can attack anyone within Leap's range. X is how many IC it would take to reach their location with Leap; if they're 120 yards away, X is 12. The &quot;Variable&quot; value is the normal Speed to perform Skillful Strike. This takes place immediately (unlike Leap, where the movement happens over time). For determining damage, and valid defenses, the toad's weapon's normal Speed is used.\n\n###### Skillful Strike (Speed Variable, 5 AP)\nThe toad uses its weapon of choice (as described under &quot;Kyodai&quot;, in Attributes) to attack.\n\n====================\n6. Terms of Contract\n------------------------------\n\nKyodai have little objection to being called into battle to protect the summoner or other members of the toad 'family'; it's part of their job as mob bosses, and while they may not be totally agreeable or treat the summoner with all that much respect, they won't let those sort of attitude issues get in the way of doing their job.\n\nOf course, they're also part of an idealized version of the yakuza, and as such think of themselves as valorous champions of the weak and downtrodden. They'll go out of their way to help anyone who falls into the category (so, not any shinobi, not nobility, and not wealthy civilians), and will refuse orders to harm them or disregard their safety. Convincing them that somebody is actually weak and being abused is a reliable, if difficult, way to get their full cooperation.</text>\n\\page\n## Summon Avatar: Gamabunta\n1. Summoning\n2. Behavior\n\n====================\n1. Summoning\n------------------------------\n\nTo shinobi, Gamabunta is the Toad Avatar; to other toads he is the Oyabun, the head of their Yakuza-like 'family'. He's one of the larger summoned avatars, tall enough that the great forests covering most of the Fire Country are barely tall enough to reach his hip. While he's not that much larger than the toad Warriors (the 'Kyodai' among the toads), his skills far surpass theirs. He's boss for a reason.\n\nGamabunta has dull, rust-red skin covered in warts. His 'chest' is brightly tattooed in red ink, though those markings are partially obscured by the blue happi vest he wears; his other identifying feature (aside from being, you know, a giant toad) is the vertical scar across his right eyelid, where he was presumably slashed (and fortunately not blinded) by some large blade.\n\nWhen Gamabunta appears, it is with a a slim (for him) metal pipe in his mouth; he does, indeed, smoke. He carries a blade holstered at his back which to him is a tanto--though in shinobi terms, the blade is the size of a tower, and large enough to cleave rivers into the ground.\n\n  -  Chakra: 70\n  -  Speed: 30\n  -  Seal Speed: 50\n\n====================\n2. Behavior\n------------------------------\n\nGamabunta is usually grumpy and apathetic; being summoned is not something he's every very pleased about. A summoner who's managed to earn his personal respect has a better time of things, but for the most part Gamabunta is the Boss of a massive organization and has much better things to do with his time than be forced into a conversation with a random underling, let alone help bail said underling out of trouble.\n\nThat said, Gamabunta does have a strong (if somewhat warped) sense of right and wrong, and will fight valiantly against genuine, serious threats. Usually refusing to be anywhere he hasn't chosen to, his opinion can be skewed one way or the other based on the nature of his 'family's' involvement.\n```\n```\n\n\n<img \n  src='https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/c99.0.520.520/17333802_179967369176374_2256892773019942912_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQ3MzE3ODExODUwNzQzMzYzMA%3D%3D.2.c' \n  style='width:325px' />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"<img ","editId":"Byg33hbisZ","shareId":"rkn22Wjib"}});
